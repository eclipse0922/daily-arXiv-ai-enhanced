### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMSNet: a configurable modular segmentation network for real-time semantic segmentation in unpaved/off-road environments, featuring a Kamino dataset (~12k images from eight cameras) and real-time deployment via CNN pruning with TensorRT/CUDA; validated on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving on rough, non-uniform terrain requires low-latency perception without predefined trails, especially in mines and developing regions. Adverse visibility and lack of track boundaries challenge drivable-area detection; need efficient, adaptable segmentation that generalizes to off-road conditions.

Method: Proposal of CMSNet with configurable modular segmentation architectures, trained to label obstacles and drivable ground. Evaluated under night, rain, and dust. Investigated drivable-region detection without explicit track boundaries and analyzed behavior under visibility impairment. Real-time inference achieved by removing CNN layers and fusing networks with TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Kamino dataset introduced with ~12k labeled images from eight synchronized cameras; field tests on an off-road proving ground. Validation performed on two datasets.

Result: Empirical experiments on two datasets support effectiveness of CMSNet approach. Kamino dataset provides a high pixel-labeling density, capturing adverse visibility conditions; real-time deployment demonstrated via optimized network architecture and deployment stack.

Conclusion: CMSNet enables real-time perception for autonomous driving on unpaved/off-road terrains under adverse conditions. The Kamino dataset enriches available resources for such scenarios. The pruning/fusion approach with TensorRT/CUDA demonstrates practical deployment potential, with scope for broader datasets and conditions in future work.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-domain plant identification using herbarium images to improve field identification in data-poor tropical regions; LifeCLEF 2020 tested ~1,000 species centered on the Guiana Shield with training on hundreds of thousands of herbarium sheets and testing on field photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the data paucity and geographic bias in automated plant recognition by leveraging digitized herbarium collections, enabling better transfer to field photos in biodiversity-rich, underrepresented regions.

Method: Assessment within the LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge: a cross-domain classification task with training on large herbarium-sheet collections and test on field photos for ~1,000 species (~Guiana Shield); reports resources, approaches by participants, and analysis of outcomes.

Result: The paper presents the resources and assessments of the evaluation, summarizes the approaches used by participating groups, and analyzes the main outcomes; explicit quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Herbarium data can inform automated plant identification in data-poor, biodiversity-rich regions, but cross-domain transfer remains challenging; the work provides resources, setups, and analyses to guide future improvements in cross-domain plant ID research.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder grounds LLMs for dash-cam driving by translating video into a hierarchical, structured cue system and using a three-block prompt strategy to enable step-wise, grounded reasoning. It improves zero-shot driving understanding and accident reasoning over end-to-end vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific driving video understanding with LLMs is hindered by general-purpose training, lack of structured inductive biases, and reliance on vision as the sole modality. There is a need for interpretable, domain-grounded reasoning that can leverage minimal supervision.

Method: iFinder is a modular, training-free pipeline that uses pretrained vision models to extract cues such as object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories. These cues are organized into a frame- and video-level hierarchical data structure and fed to LLMs with a three-block prompting strategy to enable step-wise, grounded reasoning and to refine outputs from a peer V-VLM.

Result: Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs in four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: Grounding LLMs with driving-domain representations yields a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CURE, an unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition that removes targeted samples without identity labels, introduces an Unlearning Efficiency Score (UES), and demonstrates quality-aware unlearning using low-quality images; outperforms unsupervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require data removal and deletion, but existing unlearning methods rely on identity labels that are unavailable in privacy-constrained or noisy, large-scale data. An unsupervised solution is needed to remove specific samples while preserving model performance.

Method: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure (CURE) that operates without identity labels to erase targeted samples. Introduces Unlearning Efficiency Score (UES) to balance forgetting vs. retention. Includes quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the forget set, highlighting image quality's role.

Result: CURE significantly outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. The UES provides a balanced evaluation metric for forgetting and stability. Demonstrates usability benefits of quality-aware unlearning, showing image quality impacts unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Unsupervised unlearning for facial recognition is feasible and effective with CURE. The proposed metric (UES) addresses evaluation gaps, and considering image quality enhances practical deployment of unlearning systems in privacy-constrained contexts.

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automate pixel-level artifact annotation by injecting artifacts into clean synthetic images to train detectors, enabling scalable improvement in generative model outputs without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training artifact detectors requires expensive pixel-level human annotations; naive pseudo-labeling with weak detectors yields noisy labels. Scalable, automatic annotation is needed to improve detector performance and, in turn, image generation quality.

Method: Introduce an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into high-quality synthetic images at predefined regions, producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling.

Result: Training artifact detectors yields notable improvements: 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: An initial, scalable step toward pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that incorporate world knowledge into artifact detection, enabling better alignment between artifacts and model outputs.

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A progressive, task-specific multi-task adapter design that shares early layers across tasks and progressively specializes later layers, guided by a gradient-based task similarity measure, achieving parameter-efficient multi-task learning with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate task interference and negative transfer in multi-task learning when trainable parameters are limited.

Method: Insert adapter modules into a pre-trained model; share across tasks in early layers, become more task-specific toward prediction heads; compute task similarity via gradient signals and allocate sharing groups accordingly; apply to Swin Transformer for dense prediction tasks; evaluate on PASCAL and NYUD-v2.

Result: Outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model using only about one-fifth of trainable parameters; shows better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning and surpasses current state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

Conclusion: Progressive task-specific adaptation effectively balances cross-task transfer and task specialization, offering a scalable, parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning in dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learnable, invertible preprocessing (RawJPEG Adapter) converts raw sensor data into a JPEG-friendly representation, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment, enabling higher-fidelity raw reconstruction than direct JPEG storage while remaining compatible with JPEG and other codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw captures preserve full sensor information but raw formats like DNG are bulky; JPEG is widely supported and efficient but not designed to store raw data. There is a need for a lightweight, invertible bridge that enables raw data to be compressed with JPEG/other codecs without sacrificing recoverability.

Method: A lightweight, trainable preprocessing pipeline (RawJPEG Adapter) that applies spatial and optional frequency-domain transforms to raw data. The parameters are compact and stored in the JPEG comment field, and the pipeline is invertible to enable reconstruction of the raw data. It is designed to work across JPEG and other codecs.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show higher fidelity when storing via RawJPEG Adapter than direct JPEG storage. It also supports other codecs and achieves a favorable trade-off between compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a practical, invertible bridge that enables raw data to be stored efficiently within standard JPEG pipelines, preserving more information than direct JPEG, with potential applicability to other codecs and constrained-storage scenarios.

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

### [8] [The Impact of 2D Segmentation Backbones on Point Cloud Predictions Using 4D Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19644)
*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Higher-capacity segmentation backbones do not necessarily improve radar-to-LiDAR-like point cloud quality; there exists an optimal backbone that yields substantial gains (~23.7% over SOTA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on LiDAR by reconstructing LiDAR-like 3D point clouds from radar data; assess how backbone capacity affects the quality of generated point clouds.

Method: Empirically evaluate various segmentation backbones within a radar-to-point-cloud network trained with LiDAR ground truth (RaDelft dataset); compare against state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Very high-capacity models can degrade performance; an optimally chosen segmentation backbone achieves 23.7% improvement over SOTA.

Conclusion: Backbone capacity must be selected carefully; increasing model size alone does not guarantee better radar-to-LiDAR point clouds; using an appropriately sized segmentation backbone is crucial for maximizing performance.

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

### [9] [Bias in the Picture: Benchmarking VLMs with Social-Cue News Images and LLM-as-Judge Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19659)
*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A news-image benchmark reveals systematic bias in vision-language models driven by visual cues; evaluation shows gender and occupation biases are particularly high; higher faithfulness does not ensure lower bias; resources released for reproducible fairness-aware evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and mitigate biases in vision-language models when visual attributes (age, gender, race, clothing, occupation) influence outputs, addressing risks of reproducing harmful stereotypes.

Method: Create a diverse dataset of 1,343 news-image pairs with ground-truth answers and demographic annotations; evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs; use a large language model as judge with human verification.

Result: Findings show visual context shifts outputs in open-ended tasks; bias prevalence varies by attribute and model, with high risk for gender and occupation; increased faithfulness does not consistently reduce bias.

Conclusion: Release benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible, fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTiC (Momentum Tightness and Contrast) enhances Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning by aligning new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis, applying large-scale contrastive learning, and incorporating momentum self-supervision and virtual categories to improve prototype accuracy and interclass cohesion. It achieves state-of-the-art results on three FSCIL benchmarks, notably on the fine-grained CUB-200 task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL requires learning new classes from very few samples while preserving performance on old classes. Existing methods often freeze the feature extractor and rely on class-averaged prototypes, which leads to significant estimation bias for new-class prototypes due to data scarcity, while base-class prototypes benefit from abundant data. The authors propose Bayesian-aligned priors to reduce variance, together with contrastive learning and momentum/self-supervision to improve representation quality and cohesion across classes.

Method: 1) Use Bayesian analysis to align new-class priors with old-class statistics, reducing variance in prototype estimation. 2) Employ large-scale contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. 3) Integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the MoTiC framework to enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes. 4) Build a feature space with rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion.

Result: Experiments on three FSCIL benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong gains on the fine-grained CUB-200 dataset, validating the approach’s ability to reduce estimation bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Conclusion: MoTiC effectively reduces estimation bias in new-class prototypes, strengthens interclass cohesion, and enhances robustness in FSCIL by combining Bayesian priors, large-scale contrastive learning, and momentum/self-supervision with virtual categories to construct a richer feature space.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

### [11] [Deep Learning for Clouds and Cloud Shadow Segmentation in Methane Satellite and Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19665)
*Manuel Perez-Carrasco,Maya Nasr,Sebastien Roche,Chris Chan Miller,Zhan Zhang,Core Francisco Park,Eleanor Walker,Cecilia Garraffo,Douglas Finkbeiner,Ritesh Gautam,Steven Wofsy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (UNet and SCAN) outperform traditional ILR/MLP methods for cloud and cloud shadow detection in high-resolution hyperspectral data relevant to MethaneSAT/MethaneAIR; UNet preserves spatial structure, SCAN captures fine boundaries and even outperforms UNet on MethaneSAT data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cloud and cloud shadow screening is essential to avoid bias in atmospheric methane retrievals from hyperspectral sensors, particularly for next-generation missions like MethaneSAT and its airborne companion MethaneAIR.

Method: The abstract evaluates traditional ML approaches (Iterative Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron) and advanced deep learning architectures (UNet and Spectral Channel Attention Network, SCAN) on hyperspectral data to detect clouds and shadows. It compares spatial coherence, boundary delineation, and overall detection quality across MethaneSAT-like data, highlighting the spectral attention mechanism.

Result: Conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality; UNet best preserves spatial structure, while SCAN excels at boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data.

Conclusion: Advanced deep learning architectures provide robust, scalable cloud and cloud shadow screening for methane emission quantification in current and next-generation hyperspectral missions. The work demonstrates the strengths of DL models (especially SCAN) and offers data/code publicly (DOI provided).

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

### [12] [Enhancing Transformer-Based Vision Models: Addressing Feature Map Anomalies Through Novel Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19687)
*Sumit Mamtani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two lightweight techniques—Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)—are proposed to reduce structured noise in Vision Transformer feature maps and improve interpretability. They are architecture-agnostic and show consistent gains on standard benchmarks (ImageNet, ADE20K, NYUv2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers often suffer from structured noise artifacts in feature maps, which can hinder interpretability and performance in downstream tasks like segmentation and depth estimation. There is a need for lightweight, architecture-agnostic methods to mitigate these artefacts and improve visual quality and task performance.

Method: 1) Structured Token Augmentation (STA): during tokenization, apply spatial perturbations to boost token diversity and reduce structured noise. 2) Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF): insert learnable inline denoising between transformer layers to suppress artefacts while preserving useful information. Both methods are architecture-agnostic and were evaluated across standard benchmarks.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvements in visual quality and task performance across multiple benchmarks, including ImageNet, ADE20K, and NYUv2, validating the effectiveness and practicality of STA and ANF.

Conclusion: STA and ANF offer lightweight, architecture-agnostic improvements for mitigating structured artefacts in Vision Transformers, enhancing interpretability and downstream task performance with practical gains on standard datasets.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

### [13] [From Prompt to Progression: Taming Video Diffusion Models for Seamless Attribute Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19690)
*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes frame-wise guidance to enable smooth, consistent attribute transitions in video generation, plus CAT-Bench for evaluation and two new metrics; shows improved fidelity and alignment over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with gradual attribute changes and consistent motion during video generation; prompt interpolation often fails for gradual transitions, leading to inconsistencies.

Method: During denoising, construct a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent to guide the frame-by-frame shift from initial to final attributes, while preserving motion; introduce CAT-Bench to jointly evaluate attribute and motion dynamics; propose two metrics to measure transition accuracy and smoothness.

Result: Experiments show the method outperforms baselines in fidelity, prompt alignment, and seamless attribute transitions.

Conclusion: A simple, effective approach to smooth attribute transitions in video generation, with released code and CAT-Bench for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

### [14] [Anatomically Constrained Transformers for Cardiac Amyloidosis Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19691)
*Alexander Thorley,Agis Chartsias,Jordan Strom,Roberto Lang,Jeremy Slivnick,Jamie O'Driscoll,Rajan Sharma,Dipak Kotecha,Jinming Duan,Alberto Gomez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An anatomically constrained transformer for echocardiography improves cardiac amyloidosis detection by restricting tokens to myocardium patches and applying similar constraints during MAE pre-training, yielding better performance and interpretable attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac amyloidosis imaging features are localized to the myocardium (e.g., reduced strain). General video transformers may rely on non-clinical cues, risking irrelevant features. An interpretable, anatomy-focused model can guarantee attention to clinically relevant regions.

Method: Represent the myocardium as deforming points and sample image patches to form input tokens for a transformer; constrain the model and its self-supervised MAE pre-training to operate on myocardial patches only; evaluate on CA classification.

Result: The anatomy-constrained transformer achieves higher CA classification performance than full-video transformers; it provides an explicit guarantee that decisions are based on the myocardium and enables visualization of attention over the deforming myocardium.

Conclusion: Anatomically constrained modeling improves performance and interpretability for CA detection and can extend to anatomy-guided self-supervised pre-training.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-driven clip subset selection with attention-based fusion achieves high AUC using 30% of clips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large number of clips in echocardiography; need efficient subset selection without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: RL agent decides to keep or stop processing view-specific clips to reduce uncertainty; learnable attention-based aggregation for fusion.

Result: AUC 0.91 on detecting cardiac amyloidosis using 30% of clips, outperforming all-clips and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates efficient, effective clip sampling that could facilitate clinical adoption; balance between performance and computation.

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynthICL is a domain-randomization-based data synthesis framework for universal medical image segmentation that uses anatomical priors and inter-subject variation to create diverse, realistic synthetic data for ICL; achieves substantial Dice gains on held-out datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses data scarcity in in-context learning (ICL) for universal medical image segmentation. Existing synthesis methods struggle to jointly deliver data diversity and domain realism required for medical data, hindering robust ICL models.

Method: SynthICL builds a domain-randomization data synthesis pipeline that (1) enforces realism via anatomical priors from real datasets, (2) generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and (3) explicitly models inter-subject variations to form data cohorts suitable for ICL.

Result: Experiments on four held-out datasets show that models trained with the synthesized data achieve performance gains of up to 63% in average Dice and exhibit substantially improved generalization to unseen anatomical domains.

Conclusion: SynthICL mitigates the data bottleneck for ICL-based medical image segmentation and enables robust, generalizable models. The authors also release code and the generated dataset publicly.

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

*Saimouli Katragadda,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular monocular VIMD framework that uses MSCKF-based visual-inertial motion tracking to refine per-pixel depth scales across views, compatible with various depth backbones, and capable of strong generalization with sparse depth cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense metric depth estimation from monocular cues is challenging and often relies on global affine assumptions. By leveraging accurate and efficient monocular VIO (MSCKF) and multi-view information, VIMD aims to produce accurate dense metric depth with per-pixel scale refinement, suitable for robotics and XR, including resource-constrained deployments.

Method: Introduce VIMD, a modular framework that couples MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking with multi-view depth refinement to iteratively refine per-pixel scale. The approach is backbone-agnostic for depth estimation, enabling integration with existing depth networks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on TartanAir and VOID datasets shows strong accuracy and robustness; demonstrates zero-shot generalization on the AR Table dataset; effective even with very sparse depth cues (10–20 metric depth points per image).

Conclusion: VIMD provides a practical, robust, and generalizable solution for dense metric depth estimation in monocular setups, well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments and applicable across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

*Bo Yu,Jianhua Yang,Zetao Du,Yan Huang,Chenglong Li,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMISeg is a late-fusion framework that uses frequency-domain visual features and language guidance to improve segmentation of pulmonary infections, introducing FFBI and LFFI modules and achieving state-of-the-art results on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In medical image segmentation, incorporating clinical text can guide segmentation, but semantic gaps between vision and language and the variable morphology of lesions hinder performance; prior methods struggle to enhance visual representations or suppress semantically irrelevant information.

Method: Proposes FMISeg, a late-fusion model that connects linguistic features with frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Introduces Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) to fuse frequency-domain features; and Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) to suppress semantically irrelevant visual features under text guidance.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain interaction with language guidance effectively enhances visual representations and reduces semantic noise, yielding improved segmentation of infected areas and promising clinical applicability; future work may explore broader datasets or robustness.

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [19] [PolGS: Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting for Fast Reflective Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19726)
*Yufei Han,Bowen Tie,Heng Guo,Youwei Lyu,Si Li,Boxin Shi,Yunpeng Jia,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolGS combines polarimetric constraints with 3D Gaussian Splatting to enable fast, high-quality reconstruction of reflective surfaces, achieving ~10-minute reconstruction on both synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides fast view synthesis but lags in reconstructing surfaces with complex reflectance; implicit neural representations offer higher quality but are slower. There is a need to bridge speed and accuracy for reflections in VR applications.

Method: Introduce PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model that integrates polarization constraints into the 3DGS framework to separate specular and diffuse components, enabling accurate reconstruction of reflective materials in a significantly shorter time (~10 minutes).

Result: Demonstrates improved reconstruction quality for challenging reflective materials and fast reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating the effectiveness of incorporating polarimetric cues into 3DGS.

Conclusion: PolGS provides a fast and accurate approach for reflective surface reconstruction, making real-time VR tasks more feasible by leveraging polarimetric information within the Gaussian Splatting paradigm.

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Hyunseung Kim,Chiho Choi,Srikanth Malla,Sai Prahladh Padmanabhan,Saurabh Bagchi,Joon Hee Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMILA introduces context-aware masking to validate instruction-image coherence for text-guided image editing, applying edits only to feasible regions and ignoring infeasible commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many text-guided editing methods blindly follow user instructions even when infeasible or contradictory, leading to nonsensical outputs and degraded image integrity.

Method: Propose CAMILA: a context-aware masking mechanism that assesses coherence between a textual instruction and the current image, restricting edits to relevant regions; builds datasets for single- and multi-instruction editing including infeasible requests; alignment between language and image guiding editing.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in both editing quality and semantic alignment on the constructed datasets.

Conclusion: Context-aware masking improves robustness to infeasible instructions and preserves image integrity, enabling more reliable text-guided image editing.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

*Hongtao Yang,Bineng Zhong,Qihua Liang,Zhiruo Zhu,Yaozong Zheng,Ning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFPTrack introduces a parameter-efficient visual Fourier prompt framework for RGB-T tracking, learning both spatial and frequency-domain prompts via FFT and a bidirectional multi-modal fusion prompt generator, achieving outstanding results on three RGB-T benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT-based RGB-T tracking relies on spatial-domain prompts only, neglecting frequency-domain information which can reveal complementary modality features; this limits performance.

Method: A symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters is used, together with visual Fourier prompts and a Modality Fusion Prompt Generator to produce bidirectional interaction prompts. A frozen encoder extracts RGB and TIR features; spatial-domain prompts are combined with FFT-derived frequency-domain prompts; the modality fusion prompt then interacts with each modality to enable cross-modal feature interaction.

Result: Experiments on three RGB-T tracking benchmarks show outstanding performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency-domain prompts via FFT and a fusion prompt generator improves RGB-T tracking performance while remaining parameter-efficient.

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RD^3 studies post-evaluation protocols in decoupled dataset distillation, proposes a rectified framework and standardized benchmark, and finds that evaluation choices, not synthetic data quality, largely drive reported gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent post-evaluation protocols in decoupled dataset distillation and establish fair, reproducible baselines for comparing methods.

Method: Systematic analysis of post-evaluation settings across existing decoupled methods; propose Rectified Decoupled Dataset Distillation (RD^3); develop standardized evaluation benchmarks and guidelines; test across settings to separate protocol effects from data quality.

Result: Showed that much of reported improvements stem from evaluation choices rather than intrinsic quality of distilled data; identified general strategies to improve performance across settings; established a standardized benchmark for fair comparisons.

Conclusion: RD^3 provides a foundation for fair, reproducible comparisons in dataset distillation and encourages adoption of standardized evaluation protocols in future work.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

*Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-pass SSL framework with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch) integrated into nnU-Net (nnFilterMatch) reduces labeling needs in medical image segmentation by selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels, achieving competitive or superior performance to fully supervised models with only 5–20% labeled data, without retraining loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation requires extensive manual annotation. SSL and AL can reduce annotation burden, but conventional SSL/AL hybrids rely on iterative retraining loops that are computationally expensive and not scalable in clinical settings. There is a need for annotation-efficient, scalable, end-to-end learning.

Method: Integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering into a single-pass nnU-Net framework using a mechanism called FilterMatch. The method selectively excludes high-confidence pseudo-labels during training to maintain uncertainty-guided learning without looped retraining, enabling an AL-inspired selection within a single training pass.

Result: Validated on multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing fully supervised models while using only 5%–20% of labeled data.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, end-to-end, annotation-efficient segmentation strategy that reduces labeling demands without sacrificing accuracy and eliminates the need for retraining loops in SSL/AL hybrids; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage AU-driven talking head framework: explicitly maps AUs to 2D landmarks for per-frame control; stage 1 predicts coherent landmark motion from audio+AU intensities; stage 2 diffusion-based video synthesis conditioned on landmarks and a reference image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of emotion-label-only or implicit AU conditioning methods; achieve physically grounded, per-frame expression control with improved expression accuracy and temporal stability.

Method: Stage 1: variational motion generator predicts temporally coherent 2D landmark sequences from audio and AU intensities. Stage 2: diffusion-based synthesizer generates lip-synced videos conditioned on predicted landmarks and a reference image; separation of motion and appearance.

Result: On MEAD dataset, the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for expressive talking head generation.

Conclusion: Explicit AU-to-landmark modeling, with a two-stage separation of motion and appearance, yields improved expression accuracy, temporal stability, and visual realism in audio-driven talking head generation.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpFace introduces an angular exponential margin to emphasize clean samples and suppress noisy ones in open-set face recognition, yielding improved accuracy over margin-based losses like SphereFace, CosFace, ArcFace, and providing unified analysis of margin forms and gradients. Code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate impact of noisy samples in margin-based softmax losses for open-set face recognition; address issues of training instability and non-monotonicity in existing margins.

Method: Define angular exponential margin term; apply larger penalty near center of angular space and smaller toward periphery; provide unified analytical comparison with existing margins; extensive experiments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on benchmarks; improved intra-class compactness and inter-class separability; stable training; monotonic similarity curves aligned with angular decision boundary.

Conclusion: ExpFace is effective and reproducible approach that handles noisy samples and enhances discriminative power; code released.

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

TL;DR: An end-to-end LVLM-based document parsing approach (Logics-Parsing) uses reinforcement learning to improve layout analysis and reading-order inference, supports diverse data types via fine-tuning, and introduces LogicsParsingBench for rigorous evaluation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM-based document parsing struggles with complex layouts (e.g., multi-column layouts, posters) due to the lack of explicit layout and reading-order reasoning. There is a need for broader data support (chemical formulas, handwritten Chinese) and a rigorous, diverse benchmark to evaluate progress.

Method: An end-to-end LVLM model augmented with reinforcement learning using reward mechanisms aimed at optimizing layout analysis and reading-order inference. Fine-tuning on diverse data types (chemical formulas, handwritten Chinese). Introduction of LogicsParsingBench, a dataset of 1,078 page-level PDFs across nine categories and over twenty sub-categories. Project page provided.

Result: Experiments on LogicsParsingBench demonstrate efficacy and achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse document analysis scenarios.

Conclusion: Logics-Parsing advances end-to-end LVLM-based document parsing by incorporating explicit layout and reading-order optimization and by extending data-type coverage; the LogicsParsingBench dataset enables rigorous evaluation; project page available for replication.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty
sub-categories, which will be released later. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

Motivation: Assess whether the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) itself introduces sex-based bias in segmentation evaluation, independent of models or datasets, to ensure fair interpretation of fairness studies.

Method: Apply equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants in an idealized setup, compute DSC and normalized DSC, and compare differences between sexes across small, medium, and large structures.

Result: Even minimal errors (e.g., 1 mm boundary shift) produce systematic sex-based DSC differences. For small structures, average DSC differences ~0.03; medium ~0.01; large structures (lungs, liver) show near-zero differences.

Conclusion: DSC introduces sex-based biases in evaluation that can mislead fairness conclusions. Fairness studies should account for metric bias; observed DSC gaps may not reflect true model performance differences across sexes.

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

### [28] [EfficienT-HDR: An Efficient Transformer-Based Framework via Multi-Exposure Fusion for HDR Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19779)
*Yu-Shen Huang,Tzu-Han Chen,Cheng-Yen Hsiao,Shaou-Gang Miaou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A light-weight Vision Transformer-based HDR reconstruction method for edge devices, balancing high image quality with low compute and ghosting mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDR imaging on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to computational costs and ghosting artifacts, which hinder deployment in critical tasks like surveillance and autonomous driving.

Method: A Context-Aware Vision Transformer backbone operating on YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance, with Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) to suppress ghosting, and light-weight design innovations: Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and Enhanced Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC); two model variants (main for high quality, light-weight for efficiency).

Result: Compared to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPs by ~67% and increases inference speed by >5x on CPU and 2.5x on an edge device, achieving ghost-free HDR with improved efficiency. The approach demonstrates strong performance across dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers efficient, ghost-free HDR on edge devices with a favorable quality-efficiency trade-off and practical applicability across varying dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

### [29] [BiTAA: A Bi-Task Adversarial Attack for Object Detection and Depth Estimation via 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19793)
*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA introduces a single perturbation that, via 3D Gaussian Splatting, degrades object detection and biases monocular depth estimation, with a dual-model attack framework, cross-task transfer evaluation, and an optional EOT for physical realizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based perception in autonomous driving is vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. Most attacks are task-specific, lack controllable depth bias, and there is no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored.

Method: BiTAA uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to craft a perturbation that degrades detectors and biases depth estimators. It supports dual-model attacks in full-image and patch settings, is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, and offers optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical realizability. A composite loss couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within ROIs to enable controllable near/far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. A unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world tests is proposed to quantify the interaction between detection and depth.

Result: The method yields consistent cross-task degradation and reveals a clear asymmetry between transferring from detection to depth and from depth to detection, across both virtual and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The work highlights practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception in autonomous driving and motivates cross-task-aware defenses, providing a standardized protocol to measure cross-task transfer and a perturbation mechanism to induce controllable depth bias.

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN is a 3D-augmented CycleGAN with multi-spectral fusion and astrophysical regularization to restore high-fidelity, physically consistent representations from low-res astrophotography, outperforming standard GANs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D CycleGANs struggle with morphology distortions and limited spectral and volumetric information. There is a need to leverage volumetric correlations, cross-spectral data (optical and NIR), and physics-guided regularization, guided by ground-truth all-sky surveys, to reconstruct high-fidelity celestial objects from low-resolution observations like MobilTelesco.

Method: Extend CycleGAN with (1) 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, (2) multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared domains, (3) astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Training uses ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR, ensuring cross-spectral consistency and physically plausible reconstructions.

Result: Reconstructed images are sharper and more physically consistent, with better morphology preservation, outperforming standard GAN models in astrophysical image enhancement on low-resolution data.

Conclusion: StrCGAN demonstrates that incorporating 3D structure, cross-spectral fusion, and physics-guided regularization yields high-fidelity, spectrally consistent reconstructions, enabling more accurate astrophysical analysis from low-resolution observations.

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

*Yuchuan Mao,Zhi Gao,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Chenchen Jing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A meta-learning based ensemble method (meta-weight-ensembler) that adaptively fuses task knowledge across layers to mitigate forgetting in continual learning, and can be combined with existing CL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve knowledge conflicts in ensemble-based continual learning at task and layer levels that degrade performance on old and new tasks.

Method: Train a mixing coefficient generator via meta-learning to produce per-layer mixing coefficients for fusing models from different tasks, enabling adaptive knowledge accumulation; compatibility with existing CL methods.

Result: Empirical results on multiple CL datasets show reduced catastrophic forgetting and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Meta-weight-ensembler provides a flexible, effective way to fuse knowledge across tasks, improving continual learning efficiency for both old and new tasks.

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkFake presents a reasoning-based, generalizable detector for AI-generated images, leveraging an MLLM with forgery reasoning prompts trained via GRPO RL to output interpretable, step-by-step outputs, achieving strong performance on GenImage and zero-shot generalization on LOKI, with a structured detection pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors are mostly binary, lack explanations, and rely on supervised fine-tuning, limiting generalization and robustness across datasets and unseen forgeries.

Method: Utilizes a Multimodal LLM with a forgery reasoning prompt; trains with Group Relative Policy Optimization reinforcement learning with reward design to enable step-by-step reasoning; introduces a structured detection pipeline to guide reasoning and improve adaptability.

Result: Outperforms SOTA on GenImage and shows strong zero-shot generalization on LOKI; demonstrates effectiveness and robustness; code will be released.

Conclusion: Offers a framework that combines reasoning, generalization, and interpretability for AI-generated image detection, suggesting RL-based prompting and structured pipelines as effective directions.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A benchmark for personalized embodied AI enabling agents to find and ground objects tied to specific users in photorealistic homes, highlighting real-world personalization challenges and a large, varied dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets and evaluation protocols for personalization in embodied AI, enabling agents to understand and act on user-specific object associations in home-like environments.

Method: Introduce PersONAL, a benchmark with 2,000+ episodes across 30+ HM3D homes, where each scene includes natural-language descriptions linking objects to owners. Two evaluation modes are: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in mapped scenes.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines show a substantial gap to human performance, underscoring the difficulty of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing personalized information.

Conclusion: PersONAL paves the way for developing embodied agents capable of personalized assistance in real-world settings, bridging perception, reasoning, and memory for user-specific tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

*Xin Wang,Jie Li,Zejia Weng,Yixu Wang,Yifeng Gao,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Yan Teng,Yingchun Wang,Zuxuan Wu,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals a vulnerability in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robotic systems where adversarial images can freeze model behavior, proposes FreezeVLA using min-max bi-level optimization to craft such attacks, demonstrates high attack success and transferability across models and benchmarks, underscoring the need for robust defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLA models increasingly control real-world robots, their safety and robustness against adversarial inputs remain underexplored. The work targets a critical failure mode where malicious images halt the robot's action, potentially causing harm or missed interventions.

Method: Introduce FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that uses min-max bi-level optimization to generate action-freezing adversarial images. Evaluate on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks, measuring attack success and transferability.

Result: FreezeVLA achieves an average attack success rate of 76.2%, considerably outperforming prior methods. Adversarial images show strong transferability, reliably freezing actions across diverse language prompts.

Conclusion: The work exposes a significant safety risk in VLA systems and argues for urgent development of defense mechanisms to ensure robustness against such action-freezing attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

*Yunqing Hu,Zheming Yang,Chang Zhao,Wen Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive edge-cloud detection using structured semantic guidance from an MLLM, dynamically adjusting edge detector parameters to improve accuracy in challenging scenes while reducing latency and compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional object detectors struggle in low-light and heavily occluded scenes due to limited high-level semantic understanding. The work seeks real-time semantic enhancement and efficient edge-cloud collaboration to boost robustness and efficiency.

Method: Fine-tune an MLLM with instructions to generate structured scene descriptions; implement an adaptive mapping that converts semantic cues into edge detector parameter adjustments; deploy an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework that selects cloud-guided semantics or edge outputs based on confidence scores.

Result: Claims substantial improvements in challenging scenes: latency reduced by over 79% and computational cost by ~70% while maintaining accuracy, through semantic guidance and adaptive edge-cloud collaboration.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical balance between accuracy and efficiency in complex environments by leveraging MLLM-based semantic guidance and dynamic edge-cloud collaboration, with promising implications for real-time robust detection; further work could explore robustness, generalization, and evaluation on diverse datasets.

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

### [36] [Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for 3D Spherical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19895)
*Rémi Giraud,Rodrigo Borba Pinheiro,Yannick Berthoumieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spherical shortest-path based superpixel method (SphSPS) for 360° omnidirectional images that respects spherical geometry, improving segmentation accuracy and regularity over planar and spherical baselines; validated on 360° datasets with strong robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wide-angle/omnidirectional imaging demands segmentation methods that respect the underlying spherical geometry. Traditional 2D planar superpixels distort due to projection, harming accuracy and regularity; thus there is a need for geometry-aware clustering tailored to the spherical acquisition space.

Method: Introduce SphSPS, a general superpixel algorithm that operates on spherical geometry by extending the shortest-path concept to the sphere. It computes a distance from pixels to superpixel centers on the spherical surface to extract clustering features, and it generalizes a global regularity metric to spherical space.

Result: SphSPS significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches in segmentation accuracy, robustness to noise, and regularity on 360° panorama datasets and synthetic omnidirectional road images.

Conclusion: Incorporating acquisition geometry via spherical shortest-path distances yields more accurate and regular superpixels for omnidirectional imagery, offering a valuable tool for superpixel-based tasks on 360° content.

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

*Pin-Jui Huang,Yu-Hsuan Liao,SooHeon Kim,NoSeong Park,JongBae Park,DongMyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN) for self-supervised cell-image representation that aligns perturbation embeddings across wells to mitigate batch effects, achieving strong, data-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch effects and data requirements hinder extracting meaningful, robust cell representations in cell painting; there is a need for data- and parameter-efficient methods that perform well with limited data.

Method: A masked siamese framework that enforces cross-well alignment of embeddings for the same perturbation, producing semantically consistent representations across batch differences while remaining data- and parameter-efficient.

Result: In gene-gene relationship retrieval, CWA-MSN outperforms OpenPhenom (+29%) and CellCLIP (+9%), using far less data (0.2M vs 2.2M images) and a smaller model (22M vs 1.48B parameters).

Conclusion: CWA-MSN offers a simple, effective approach to learning cell image representations robust to batch effects and suitable for phenotype modeling under tight data/compute budgets.

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

### [38] [Aerial-Ground Image Feature Matching via 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Intermediate View Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19898)
*Jiangxue Yu,Hui Wang,San Jiang,Xing Zhang,Dejin Zhang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel feature matching pipeline for aerial-ground image pairs that uses intermediate views generated from aerial data to bridge perspective gaps, enabling more reliable matches and ISfM/3DGS reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable correspondences between aerial and ground images are severely hampered by large viewpoint changes, hindering accurate 3D modeling of complex scenes.

Method: 1) Reconstruct a sparse model from aerial images with an incremental SfM engine; 2) Use 3D Gaussian Splatting to render the scene from sparse points and oriented images; 3) Determine render viewpoints from aerial camera poses to generate high-quality intermediate images bridging aerial-ground gaps; 4) Use intermediate images to perform reliable matching between render-aerial and render-ground images; 5) Transmit correspondences through intermediate views to final matches; 6) Validate on real aerial/ground datasets and compare to widely used methods.

Result: The approach increases the number of initial and refined matches, provides enough correspondences for accurate incremental SfM reconstruction and complete 3D Gaussian Splatting-based scene rendering, and outperforms baseline methods on real datasets.

Conclusion: Bridging viewpoint gaps with intermediate views enables more reliable cross-domain feature matching, supporting robust ISfM and 3DGS-based scene rendering for aerial and ground imagery.

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

### [40] [GS-RoadPatching: Inpainting Gaussians via 3D Searching and Placing for Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19937)
*Guo Chen,Jiarun Liu,Sicong Du,Chenming Wu,Deqi Li,Shi-Sheng Huang,Guofeng Zhang,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-RoadPatching introduces a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)–based inpainting method for driving scenes that performs substitutional editing directly in 3D space via multi-scale patch-based structural matching, avoiding 2D diffusion/GAN prediction and retraining. It achieves state-of-the-art quality and interoperability on driving datasets and generalizes to other scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driving scene inpainting requires reliable, efficient completion that aligns with fully reconstructed regions. Existing 2D perspective-view diffusion or GAN-based methods rely on cross-modal 2D consistency and often demand time-consuming retraining of Gaussians. Exploiting repetitive patterns in driving scenes within the 3DGS feature space enables structural matching for effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.

Method: Construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes and develop a patch measurement method to abstract local context at multiple scales. Propose a structural search to find candidate patches in 3D space, followed by a substitution-and-fusion optimization to ensure visual harmony, without requiring 2D cross-modal consistency or retraining. 

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available driving-scene datasets demonstrate the method’s effectiveness and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in quality and interoperability compared to baselines. Additional experiments in general scenes show applicability of the 3D inpainting strategy.

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching enables substitutional inpainting/editing directly in the 3DGS modality, improving driving-scene completion efficiency and interoperability while eliminating the need for time-consuming 2D retraining or cross-modal constraints. The approach generalizes to general scenes and is accompanied by a project page and code.

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

### [41] [Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19943)
*Edmund Bu,Yossi Gandelsman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interpreting CLIP-ResNet neurons by decomposing outputs into neuron-head computation paths, revealing sparse, interpretable contributions that align with text embeddings; enables training-free semantic segmentation and shift monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and decode how individual neurons and attention heads contribute to outputs in CLIP-ResNet, enabling interpretable units and practical downstream applications.

Method: Analyze all pairwise neuron-head combinations in CLIP's attention-pooling layer; approximate their contributions by a single direction in the image-text embedding space; associate neuron-head pairs with text; identify a sparse set of significant pairs; examine polysemantic sub-concepts.

Result: Identified a sparse, interpretable set of neuron-head pairs that can be mapped to text; observed that a direction captures their combined effect; achieved training-free semantic segmentation outperforming prior CLIP-ResNet methods; demonstrated usefulness for monitoring dataset distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Examining individual computation paths yields interpretable units useful for downstream tasks; neuron-head contributions provide a path to interpretability and practical tools for segmentation and dataset monitoring.

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

### [42] [When Words Can't Capture It All: Towards Video-Based User Complaint Text Generation with Multimodal Video Complaint Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19952)
*Sarmistha Das,R E Zera Marveen Lyngkhoi,Kirtan Jain,Vinayak Goyal,Sriparna Saha,Manish Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CoD-V: a task to generate expressive complaint descriptions from videos, backed by the ComVID dataset, a new Complaint Retention (CR) metric, and a multimodal RAG-based VideoLLaMA2-7b model; includes evaluations and public resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help users articulate complaints more expressively by leveraging video evidence, addressing the gap between vague text (e.g., 'worst product') and concrete visual demonstrations of defects.

Method: Create ComVID dataset with 1,175 complaint videos plus descriptive captions and emotion annotations; propose a Complaint Retention (CR) metric distinguishing CoD-V from standard video-to-text tasks; develop a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework using VideoLLaMA2-7b to generate complaints conditioned on the user's emotional state; evaluate various Video Language Models on tasks using metrics such as METEOR, perplexity, and readability (Coleman-Liau).

Result: Establishes a new dataset (ComVID) and task (CoD-V), introduces the CR evaluation metric, and demonstrates a multimodal RAG-based approach (VideoLLaMA2-7b) for generating complaint descriptions from videos; provides baseline evaluations across multiple models and metrics, and releases dataset/resources for future work.

Conclusion: Lays the groundwork for a new research direction enabling users to express complaints via video, with public dataset and tools to advance expressive complaint mining and video-based narrative generation.

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and
resources are available at: https://github.com/sarmistha-D/CoD-V.

### [43] [SynchroRaMa : Lip-Synchronized and Emotion-Aware Talking Face Generation via Multi-Modal Emotion Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19965)
*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa introduces a multi-modal emotion embedding for audio-driven talking-face generation, combining text sentiment, audio emotion cues, and LLM-generated scene descriptions, plus an audio-to-motion module, to improve realism, fidelity, and temporal consistency over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion-aware methods rely on a single modality for emotion and a single reference image, which limits expressive cues and dynamic, time-varying attributes in talking-face generation.

Method: Propose SynchroRaMa, which fuses multi-modal emotion signals (text sentiment, audio-based emotion recognition with valence-arousal features) and scene descriptions from LLMs as textual input; includes an audio-to-motion (A2M) module for lip-sync and natural head motion; conditions the model on both visual and textual cues to enhance temporal consistency.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art improvements in image quality, expression preservation, and motion realism; a user study reports higher subjective naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness compared to competing methods.

Conclusion: Multi-modal emotion embedding combined with textual scene descriptions enhances realism and fidelity in audio-driven talking-face generation, with SynchroRaMa outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

### [44] [OmniScene: Attention-Augmented Multimodal 4D Scene Understanding for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19973)
*Pei Liu,Hongliang Lu,Haichao Liu,Haipeng Liu,Xin Liu,Ruoyu Yao,Shengbo Eben Li,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniScene introduces OmniVLM and a hierarchical fusion strategy to embed language-based semantics into 3D perception, enabling human-like 4D scene understanding for autonomous driving and achieving state-of-the-art results on nuScenes across perception, prediction, planning, and VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems rely mainly on depth-based 3D reconstruction and lack true scene understanding that combines multi-view, temporal, and semantic (language-based) information in a human-like manner.

Method: 1) OmniVLM—a vision-language model that integrates multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. 2) A teacher-student OmniVLM architecture with knowledge distillation that embeds textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic supervision and to capture human-like attentional semantics. 3) Alignment of learned features with human driving behaviors to form a perception-understanding-action loop. 4) Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to adaptively calibrate the importance of geometric and semantic features across multiple abstraction levels, enabling dynamic, multimodal fusion of visual and textual cues.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on the nuScenes dataset showing superior performance over more than ten state-of-the-art models across perception, prediction, planning, and visual question answering tasks, establishing new benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniScene provides a human-like perception-understanding-action architecture that effectively fuses multimodal cues (visual and textual) through a learnable Hierarchical Fusion Strategy and language-guided semantic supervision, yielding consistent gains across multiple autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

### [45] [CamPVG: Camera-Controlled Panoramic Video Generation with Epipolar-Aware Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19979)
*Chenhao Ji,Chaohui Yu,Junyao Gao,Fan Wang,Cairong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework CamPVG for panoramic video generation guided by camera poses, introducing a panoramic Plücker embedding and a spherical epipolar module for geometry-aware cross-view fusion, achieving high-quality, trajectory-consistent panoramic videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic video generation lags due to challenges in representing extrinsic camera poses on a sphere and applying accurate cross-view fusion in equirectangular projection. Existing methods underperform for panoramic geometry and consistency.

Method: CamPVG framework; panoramic Plücker embedding encoding extrinsics via spherical coordinate transformation; diffusion-based video generation; spherical epipolar module with adaptive attention masking along epipolar lines for cross-view feature aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method generates high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, outperforming existing panoramic video generation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Plücker embedding and epipolar-guided fusion effectively capture panoramic geometry, enabling reliable, high-quality, trajectory-consistent panoramic video generation with diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

TL;DR: SDE-DET: a high-performance pomelo detector using Star Block, deformable attention, and Efficient Multi-Scale Attention on STP-AgriData, achieving state-of-the-art results and enabling autonomous harvesting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of Shatian pomelo detection in orchards—occlusions, multi-scale sizes, and small-object detection—to support automated harvesting and maturity assessment.

Method: Propose SDE-DET: Star Block for rich features with low overhead; Deformable Attention in backbone; Integrated Efficient Multi-Scale Attention for improved small-object detection; train/evaluate on STP-AgriData; compare with YOLO series.

Result: Quantitative metrics: Precision 0.883, Recall 0.771, mAP@0.5 0.838, mAP@0.5:0.95 0.497, F1 0.823; claims state-of-the-art on STP-AgriData.

Conclusion: SDE-DET offers a reliable detection method for Shatian pomelo and supports future development of automated harvest robotics.

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

### [47] [Improving Generalizability and Undetectability for Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Multimodal Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19994)
*Zhifang Zhang,Jiahan Zhang,Shengjie Zhou,Qi Wei,Shuo He,Feng Liu,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA) for multimodal pre-trained models to improve generalizability and undetectability of targeted adversarial examples by exploiting multiple source/target proxies; theoretical insights and experiments show strong success across related targets with robust undetectability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal pre-trained models align diverse modalities, enabling impressive downstream performance but exposing new security risks. Existing targeted attacks on these models show limited generalizability to semantically related targets and can be detected by anomaly detectors, leaving security gaps.

Method: Introduce Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA) that optimizes targeted adversarial examples using multiple source-modal and target-modal proxy targets. The approach leverages multiple proxies to shape perturbations that generalize to related targets while preserving undetectability. The work provides theoretical analyses on the trade-off between generalizability and undetectability and validates optimization under undetectability constraints.

Result: PTA achieves high success rates across a range of related targets and remains undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: PTA demonstrates that cross-modal proxy strategies improve the generalizability of targeted attacks while maintaining stealth, highlighting security risks in multimodal models and motivating the development of stronger defenses. Theoretical insights accompany empirical results to explain the generalizability-undetectability relationship.

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

### [48] [Anomaly Detection by Clustering DINO Embeddings using a Dirichlet Process Mixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19997)
*Nico Schulthess,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Model normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) for scalable unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging; avoids large memory banks, achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, and benefits from normalized embeddings that align with anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-bank anomaly detection works for small datasets but becomes computationally expensive for large medical datasets. There is a need for scalable, unsupervised methods leveraging strong embeddings to detect anomalies without large memory stores.

Method: Model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings using a non-parametric Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). Use the similarity between DPMM component centers and embeddings as an anomaly score to generate a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Rely on DINOv2 embeddings trained on natural images, which, when normalized, better align with anatomical structures.

Result: DPMM-based embeddings achieve competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks while halving inference time compared with memory-bank approaches. Normalized DINOv2 embeddings tend to align more with anatomical structures even in the presence of anomalies.

Conclusion: DINOv2 embeddings, when modeled with a DPMM, provide a scalable and effective framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, benefiting from normalization that enhances anatomical alignment. Code namespace is provided for replication.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/NicoSchulthess/anomalydino-dpmm.

TL;DR: Diversity-aware active learning for object detection improves annotation efficiency, outperforming random sampling and nearing fully supervised performance under budget, validated on TableBank datasets with CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation is costly for object detection; there is a need for efficient sample selection in active learning to maximize model generalization under labeling budgets.

Method: Proposes a diversity-based active learning sample selection strategy to pick representative, informative object-detection examples. Evaluated on TableBank-LaTeX and TableBank-Word using CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9, compared against random sampling.

Result: AL-based sample selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort within a fixed budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models; yields higher mAP at the same annotation budget.

Conclusion: Diversity-aware active learning improves data efficiency for object detection, enabling near fully supervised performance with reduced labeling costs.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

### [50] [Does the Manipulation Process Matter? RITA: Reasoning Composite Image Manipulations via Reversely-Ordered Incremental-Transition Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20006)
*Xuekang Zhu,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Kaiwen Feng,Chenfan Qu,Yunfei Wang,Liting Zhou,Jian liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframes image manipulation localization as a conditional sequence prediction task (layer-by-layer) via the RITA framework, enabling temporal and hierarchical modeling of editing steps instead of one-shot masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IML methods are manipulation-process-agnostic and produce single-shot localization masks, causing dimensional collapse and a mismatch with the true hierarchical, stepwise nature of edits. There is a need to model editing steps and temporal dependencies.

Method: RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered sequence, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next. It synthesizes multi-step manipulation data, constructs the HSIM benchmark, and introduces the HSS metric to evaluate sequential order and hierarchical alignment.

Result: Experiments show RITA achieves state-of-the-art performance on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for hierarchical localization tasks. The authors plan to release code and dataset publicly.

Conclusion: RITA represents a novel, general paradigm for hierarchical, sequential localization in image manipulation detection, addressing the core mismatch of one-shot methods and enabling richer, structured localization of edits.

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

### [51] [PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022)
*Manahil Raza,Ayesha Azam,Talha Qaiser,Nasir Rajpoot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS3 introduces a three-modal Transformer that fuses pathology reports, whole slide images (WSIs), and transcriptomic data via prototype-based balanced representations to predict survival. It achieves superior prognostic performance across six TCGA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal approaches in computational oncology largely combine WSIs with genomic data but underutilize pathology reports. The heterogeneous, high-dimensional WSIs and concise text reports create modality imbalance and integration challenges. Incorporating pathology reports could further improve survival prediction.

Method: Extract and construct three prototype types: Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports using self-attention to identify diagnostically relevant sections; Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions. These prototype-based representations are input to a three-modal Transformer (PS3) that models intra- and cross-modal interactions across pathology, WSIs, and transcriptomics for survival prediction.

Result: PS3 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including clinical, unimodal, and multimodal methods, on six TCGA datasets, demonstrating improved prognostic performance.

Conclusion: Prototype-based balancing and three-modal fusion enable effective integration of heterogeneous pathology, imaging, and molecular data, advancing survival prediction in cancer.

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

### [52] [Generative Adversarial Networks Applied for Privacy Preservation in Biometric-Based Authentication and Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20024)
*Lubos Mjachky,Ivan Homoliak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes privacy-preserving biometric authentication by translating face images into a visually private domain with a GAN and training classifiers on these translated images to maintain utility while protecting user data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric systems can leak data and restrict user control over data usage; there is a need for privacy-preserving authentication that prevents misuse or leakage of biometric information.

Method: Apply a generative adversarial network (GAN) to translate face images into a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes). Train authentication classifiers on these translated images to perform recognition without exposing the original biometric data.

Result: The approach is reported to be robust against attacks and to retain meaningful utility in authentication tasks.

Conclusion: GAN-based domain translation can enable privacy-preserving biometric authentication by decoupling identity from raw biometric data while preserving practical authentication performance.

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

### [53] [Predictive Quality Assessment for Mobile Secure Graphics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20028)
*Cas Steigstra,Sergey Milyaev,Shaodi You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, task-driven frame-quality predictor is proposed to bridge the reliability gap in secure graphic verification by filtering frames for expensive verification. A frozen ImageNet-pretrained backbone generalizes better to unseen printing technologies than full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone capture variability degrades reliability of secure graphic verification, causing high false rejection. The paper aims to predict per-frame utility for downstream verification to reduce the reliability gap.

Method: Propose a lightweight model that predicts a quality score for each video frame to decide its suitability for an expensive verification oracle. Validate on a large-scale dataset (32,000+ images from 105 smartphones) using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics. Conduct a cross-domain analysis with graphics from different industrial printing presses, comparing a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained backbone versus a fully fine-tuned model.

Result: The approach yields a practical frame-utility predictor that improves verification reliability. Cross-domain findings show that a frozen ImageNet backbone generalizes better to unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model, highlighting robustness to domain shifts.

Conclusion: For domain shifts arising from physical manufacturing, adopting a frozen general-purpose backbone can offer greater robustness and reduce overfitting, informing real-world deployment of secure graphic verification systems.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

### [54] [SHMoAReg: Spark Deformable Image Registration via Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts and Attention Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20073)
*Yuxi Zheng,Jianhui Feng,Tianran Li,Marius Staring,Yuchuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SHMoAReg, a Mixture of Experts-based DIR network with MoA in encoder and SHMoE in decoder, achieving improved Dice scores and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIR methods need specialized, task-relevant feature extraction and heterogeneous, directional deformation modeling; standard encoder-decoder architectures apply deformation uniformly in all directions.

Method: Incorporates Mixture of Attention heads (MoA) in encoder layers to dynamically select attention heads per token; uses Spatial Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) in decoder layers to predict deformation fields heterogeneously in the three directions with varying kernel sizes; evaluated on two public datasets.

Result: Dice score on abdominal CT dataset improved from 60.58% to 65.58%; consistent improvements across tested methods; SHMoAReg enhances interpretability by showing how experts are utilized across/within resolution layers.

Conclusion: First to introduce Mixture of Experts into DIR tasks; SHMoAReg offers better feature specialization and interpretability; code release planned.

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

### [55] [Unleashing the Potential of the Semantic Latent Space in Diffusion Models for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20091)
*Zizheng Yang,Hu Yu,Bing Li,Jinghao Zhang,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-latent guided dehazing method (DiffLI^2D) leverages the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models to provide dehazing guidance, avoiding diffusion-retraining and iterative sampling, and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel at modeling data distributions but require expensive retraining and long sampling; image dehazing can benefit from latent representations of hazy content and haze; aim to exploit semantic latent space without updating diffusion models.

Method: Identify that semantic latent space of pre-trained diffusion models encodes content and haze across diffusion time-steps; fuse latent representations from multiple time-steps into a lightweight dehazing network; train the network end-to-end on hazy-clean pairs while keeping diffusion model frozen; avoids re-training and iterative sampling; outputs dehazed image.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that DiffLI^2D outperforms existing dehazing methods; code available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: This work introduces diffusion latent representations as effective priors for dehazing, providing a practical and efficient alternative to diffusion-based dehazing methods and offering a new direction for integrating diffusion models into image restoration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

### [56] [Hyperspectral Adapter for Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20107)
*JuanaJuana Valeria Hurtado,Rohit Mohan,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hyperspectral adapter aligns HSI data with frozen vision transformers using a spectral transformer, spectrum-aware spatial prior, and modality-aware interaction block to achieve state-of-the-art semantic segmentation on autonomous driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-centric architectures struggle with hyperspectral data; there is a need for architectures that can effectively learn from rich spectral information while leveraging powerful pretrained vision models.

Method: Introduce a hyperspectral adapter comprising a spectral transformer, spectrum-aware spatial prior, and a modality-aware interaction block that extracts/injects hyperspectral representations with frozen vision Transformer features, enabling effective fusion and segmentation from HSI inputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation on three autonomous driving benchmarks using raw HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral methods; code is released.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of a hyperspectral-adapter approach to leverage pretrained vision models for HSI perception, enabling robust segmentation under challenging illumination/ material conditions; facilitates practical deployment with public code.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

*Belal Shoer,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unifies text and image in scientific VQA by synthetic text-in-image data and multilingual fine-tuning, yielding cross-lingual gains on 13 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific VQA with complex figures and multimodal context is challenging for vision-language models. Treating figure and text separately limits performance; zero-shot results on text-in-image setups (EXAMS-V) are poor, highlighting the need for task-specific data.

Method: Generate a synthetic dataset by transforming existing separate image–text pairs into unified text-in-image figures. Fine-tune a small multilingual multimodal model on a mixture of the synthetic data and EXAMS-V. Evaluate across 13 languages to assess average gains and cross-lingual transfer.

Result: Fine-tuning on the mixed synthetic and EXAMS-V data yields notable improvements across 13 languages, with strong average gains and demonstrated cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: Synthetic text-in-image data plus targeted fine-tuning can substantially improve scientific VQA performance in a multilingual setting, and the approach demonstrates effective cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

### [58] [EchoBench: Benchmarking Sycophancy in Medical Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20146)
*Botai Yuan,Yutian Zhou,Yingjie Wang,Fushuo Huo,Yongcheng Jing,Li Shen,Ying Wei,Zhiqi Shen,Ziwei Liu,Tianwei Zhang,Jie Yang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoBench reveals widespread sycophancy in medical LVLMs across open, medical-specific, and proprietary models; prompt-based mitigations can reduce this bias; dataset enables safer evaluation beyond accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes clinical settings, models tend to echo user-provided information. This undermines reliability and safety, yet evaluation has focused on accuracy. The paper motivates measuring and mitigating sycophancy in medical LVLMs.

Method: EchoBench comprises 2,122 images across 18 departments and 20 modalities, with 90 prompts simulating biased inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. It evaluates medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs; includes fine-grained analyses by bias type, department, perceptual granularity, and modality; explores prompt-level mitigation strategies (negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot).

Result: All models exhibit substantial sycophancy. The best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) shows 45.98% sycophancy; GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95% sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Higher data quality/diversity and stronger domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. Simple prompt-level interventions consistently reduce sycophancy, showing potential for mitigation alongside training- and decoding-time strategies.

Conclusion: Robust evaluation beyond accuracy is needed for medical LVLMs. EchoBench provides a testbed to quantify and mitigate sycophancy and offers actionable guidance toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

*Sanish Suwal,Shaurya Garg,Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pruning improves both the interpretability and faithfulness of post-hoc saliency explanations for traffic sign classifiers, outperforming natural and adversarial training in explanation quality, while also boosting model efficiency through sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure transparency and safety in connected/autonomous vehicle AI by understanding how training choices affect the reliability of explanations for traffic sign classifiers.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation of three training approaches—natural training, adversarial training, and pruning—on traffic sign classifiers. Explanations are assessed via saliency maps, focusing on comprehensibility and faithfulness, with additional considerations of efficiency and sparsity.

Result: Pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (via saliency maps) and enforces sparsity, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: Pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent, resource-efficient deep learning models in vehicular AI, with potential to balance performance, explainability, and safety.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

*Min Cen,Zhenfeng Zhuang,Yuzhe Zhang,Min Zeng,Baptiste Magnier,Lequan Yu,Hong Zhang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C^2MIL: a dual structural causal graph MIL method for WSIs that mitigates semantic bias from staining/scanning and topological noise via cross-scale feature disentangling and differentiable subgraph sampling, improving generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Staining/scanning variations introduce semantic bias and non-causal topological subgraphs add noise, harming slide-level representations and interpretability in graph-based MIL for WSIs; a causal framework addressing both semantic and topological factors is needed.

Method: Proposes a dual structural causal model and the C^2MIL framework: (1) a cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention, and (2) a Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling mechanism for topological causal discovery; jointly optimized with disentangling supervision and contrastive learning to refine both semantic and topological causalities.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements in generalization and interpretability over existing MIL methods; C^2MIL can enhance diverse MIL baselines; code available.

Conclusion: C^2MIL advances MIL for WSI analysis by enabling simultaneous semantic and topological causal interventions, yielding more robust and interpretable slide representations; the approach is adaptable to other MIL settings.

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated, accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in CBCT is labor-intensive; unlabeled data is abundant, motivating semi-supervised approaches to reduce labeling requirements.

Method: Multi-stage training: (1) self-supervised pretraining of U-Mamba2 with a disruptive autoencoder; (2) semi-supervised training with consistency regularization using input and feature perturbations; (3) pseudo-labeling with reduced loss weighting to mitigate labeling errors.

Result: Validation metrics include an average score of 0.872 and a Dice score (DSC) of 0.969.

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL demonstrates superior performance by effectively leveraging unlabeled data through self-supervision, consistency constraints, and careful pseudo-labeling; code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

*Patricia Schöntag,David Nakath,Judith Fischer,Rüdiger Röttgers,Kevin Köser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Optical Ocean Recipes provide a controlled, repeatable framework to generate realistic underwater datasets with ground-truth data, enabling robust benchmarking of machine vision under varied water conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater machine vision faces optical challenges (color distortion, reduced contrast, blur from backscatter and scattering, dynamic illumination) and large regional/depth/seasonal appearance variations. Lack of controlled, ground-truth testing and generalizable benchmarks hampers progress; exhaustive open-water testing is impractical.

Method: Introduce Optical Ocean Recipes that use calibrated color and scattering additives to create realistic yet controllable underwater environments. These recipes produce repeatable datasets with ground-truth for tasks such as water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. A demonstration dataset is generated, and evaluation code is provided (and will be released).

Result: A demonstration dataset generated under controlled optical conditions; initial validation across two underwater vision tasks; ready-to-release dataset and evaluation code.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unique, realistic-but-controlled platform for analyzing and benchmarking underwater machine vision, enabling systematic study of water-parameter effects and improving generalizability across diverse underwater scenes.

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

*Mahmoud Khater,Mona Strauss,Philipp von Olshausen,Alexander Reiterer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PU-Gaussian introduces anisotropic 3D Gaussian neighborhoods to model local geometry for point cloud upsampling, performing explicit sampling in the geometric domain to produce a dense coarse point cloud, followed by a refinement network to improve uniformity and sharp edges; reports state-of-the-art on PU1K and PUGAN with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense and high-fidelity 3D representations are needed from sparse/noisy point clouds; existing implicit feature-based upsampling or distance-function methods trade off geometric interpretability or robustness to sparsity. A geometry-aware, interpretable approach could improve robustness and quality.

Method: Model local neighborhoods around each point as anisotropic 3D Gaussian distributions. Sample points directly in the local geometric domain to generate a dense, coarse point cloud. Use a subsequent refinement network to regularize distribution and sharpen edges, producing a final high-quality upsampled cloud. Train and evaluate on PU1K and PUGAN datasets; release code and weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PU1K and PUGAN datasets according to reported metrics.

Conclusion: An interpretable, geometry-centric upsampling framework that combines explicit local-domain sampling via anisotropic Gaussians with a refinement stage; improves robustness to sparsity and yields higher-quality dense point clouds; code provided.

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available
at https://github.com/mvg-inatech/PU-Gaussian.git.

TL;DR: Challenging the claim that CNNs are texture-biased by introducing a domain-agnostic feature-reliance framework with controlled suppression of shape, texture, and color cues; finds CNNs rely mainly on local shape rather than texture, and that modern training/architectures can mitigate this bias; cross-domain patterns show shape emphasis in CV, color emphasis in medical imaging, and texture emphasis in remote sensing; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in cue-conflict experiments and to quantify feature reliance without forced-choice confounds, across humans and neural networks, using a domain-agnostic suppression framework and cross-domain evaluation.

Method: Develop a domain-agnostic framework that systematically suppresses shape, texture, and color cues; evaluate humans and neural networks under suppression conditions (not relying on forced-choice conflicts); compare architectural families (e.g., ConvNeXt, ViTs); extend analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing.

Result: CNNs are not inherently texture-biased; they predominantly rely on local shape features. Reliance can be substantially reduced with modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). Cross-domain patterns: CV models emphasize shape, medical imaging emphasizes color, remote sensing emphasizes texture.

Conclusion: Texture bias is not inherent to CNNs; feature reliance is controllable through training and architecture choices. Results highlight domain-specific priors and underline the need for evaluation under suppression to understand reliance patterns. Public code repository provided.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Agentic AI is rapidly advancing in healthcare and biomedical research.
However, in medical image analysis, their performance and adoption remain
limited due to the lack of a robust ecosystem, insufficient toolsets, and the
absence of real-time interactive expert feedback. Here we present "TissueLab",
a co-evolving agentic AI system that allows researchers to ask direct
questions, automatically plan and generate explainable workflows, and conduct
real-time analyses where experts can visualize intermediate results and refine
them. TissueLab integrates tool factories across pathology, radiology, and
spatial omics domains. By standardizing inputs, outputs, and capabilities of
diverse tools, the system determines when and how to invoke them to address
research and clinical questions. Across diverse tasks with clinically
meaningful quantifications that inform staging, prognosis, and treatment
planning, TissueLab achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with
end-to-end vision-language models (VLMs) and other agentic AI systems such as
GPT-5. Moreover, TissueLab continuously learns from clinicians, evolving toward
improved classifiers and more effective decision strategies. With active
learning, it delivers accurate results in unseen disease contexts within
minutes, without requiring massive datasets or prolonged retraining. Released
as a sustainable open-source ecosystem, TissueLab aims to accelerate
computational research and translational adoption in medical imaging while
establishing a foundation for the next generation of medical AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing
within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and
video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video
editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting
emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.

TL;DR: HUNT is a real-time UAV framework that unifies high-speed traversal and target tracking using onboard observables, enabling seamless switching from search to tracking in degraded, GPS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigating unknown, unstructured environments at high speed and tracking targets without reliable global localization is challenging; existing relative navigation methods rely on a detected target and falter when no target is visible.

Method: HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard observables (attitude, altitude, velocity) within a single relative formulation, enabling reactive traversal during search and seamless transition to tracking once a target is detected.

Result: Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and real-world search-and-rescue scenarios with vehicles and mannequins show robust autonomous performance where global methods fail.

Conclusion: A unified, observation-driven framework like HUNT can achieve reliable high-speed navigation and tracking in degraded sensing conditions, potentially broadening UAV autonomy in search-and-rescue and similar missions.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both
traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once
detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global
localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation
have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible
detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field
of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time
framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single
relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard
instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling
reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same
perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor
experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue
operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where
global methods fail.

TL;DR: ROPA uses offline data augmentation to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D robot perceptions for eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation by fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, generating matching joint actions and enforcing physics via gripper-object constraints; evaluated on 5 sim and 3 real tasks with strong improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting diverse real-world demonstrations for robust bimanual manipulation is costly. Existing augmentation methods cover only limited modalities (eye-in-hand or unpaired actions). ROPA addresses data scarcity by generating realistic, labeled synthetic poses and observations in eye-to-hand RGB-D settings.

Method: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Simultaneously generate corresponding joint-space action labels. Use constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency via gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual setups.

Result: Evaluated on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks; 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials. ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, demonstrating scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation for eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

Conclusion: ROPA provides an effective augmentation framework for imitation learning in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation by producing realistic, labeled RGB/RGB-D data with physical consistency, enabling scalable data generation and improved policy performance.

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning
requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and
scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world
demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior
works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either
eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel
images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand
(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this
paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data
Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method
that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D
observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates
corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained
optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate
gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our
method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625
simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms
baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data
augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL) enables few-shot imitation by self-generating demonstrations from simulation with dual augmentation and a trajectory selector, achieving state-of-the-art on LIBERO with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning across many tasks suffers from the high cost of expert demonstrations. The paper aims to reduce supervision by enabling a model to progressively improve using self-generated data from simulated interactions.

Method: SEIL starts by executing tasks in a simulator to collect successful trajectories as new demonstrations, then iteratively refines the model. It uses dual augmentation: (1) model-level via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model; (2) environment-level by introducing small variations in initial object positions. A lightweight selector filters complementary and informative trajectories from the pool to ensure demonstration quality.

Result: On LIBERO, SEIL achieves new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning, outperforming prior methods with substantially fewer training examples.

Conclusion: SEIL demonstrates that self-evolved demonstrations with dual augmentation and selective filtering can substantially reduce supervision requirements while maintaining competitive or superior performance, representing a scalable approach for few-shot imitation learning. The code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent
across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which
are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited
supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework
that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions.
The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful
trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To
enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level
augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model
to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing
slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a
lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories
from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples
enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training
examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves
a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces CU-Multi, a long-term, multi-robot dataset for collaborative perception with synchronized four-robot runs, rich sensor suite, and dense annotations to enable standardized C-SLAM benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking collaborative SLAM is hindered by scarce, non-standardized multi-robot datasets. Many studies reuse partitioned single-robot trajectories, which poorly reflect true multi-robot operation and hinder cross-study comparison; a dataset with synchronized starts and controlled overlap is needed to evaluate collaboration fairly.

Method: Data collected over multiple days at two outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Four synchronized runs with aligned start times and controlled trajectory overlap. Sensors include RGB-D, RTK GPS, and semantic LiDAR, plus refined ground-truth odometry. The dataset also provides dense semantic annotations.

Result: CU-Multi provides a robust, reproducible benchmark for multi-robot perception tasks, combining overlap variation with dense semantic annotations and refined odometry to enable standardised evaluation of C-SLAM methods.

Conclusion: By addressing limitations of prior datasets—short trajectories, limited inter-robot overlap, and sparse loop closures—CU-Multi establishes a valuable, standard resource for evaluating multi-robot collaboration in perception tasks.

Abstract: A central challenge for multi-robot systems is fusing independently gathered
perception data into a unified representation. Despite progress in
Collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), benchmarking remains hindered by the scarcity of
dedicated multi-robot datasets. Many evaluations instead partition single-robot
trajectories, a practice that may only partially reflect true multi-robot
operations and, more critically, lacks standardization, leading to results that
are difficult to interpret or compare across studies. While several multi-robot
datasets have recently been introduced, they mostly contain short trajectories
with limited inter-robot overlap and sparse intra-robot loop closures. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CU-Multi, a dataset collected over
multiple days at two large outdoor sites on the University of Colorado Boulder

*Adarsh Salagame,Henry Noyes,Alireza Ramezani,Eric Sihite,Arash Kalantari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bio-inspired COBRA snake-style robot combines sidewinding and tumbling to navigate Shackleton Crater terrain for lunar ice exploration; robustness and efficiency demonstrated via simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access lunar water ice in permanently shadowed regions to support drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel for a sustained lunar base; current rover mobility limits pose immobilization risks.

Method: Design COBRA with two locomotion modes: (1) snake-like sidewinding for flat/low-slope terrains; (2) tumbling mode forming a circular barrel by linking head and tail for rapid, energy-efficient movement on steep slopes. Onboard computer, stereo camera, IMU, and joint encoders enable real-time data collection and autonomous operation. Validation through simulations and experimental experiments.

Result: COBRA demonstrates robustness and efficiency in navigating extreme crater terrains; capable of autonomous operation with real-time data collection; simulations and experiments validate mobility in challenging lunar terrains.

Conclusion: COBRA is a promising mobility platform for lunar ice access and crater exploration, extending reach to Shackleton Crater and supporting sustainable lunar base activities; the hybrid locomotion strategy mitigates immobilization risk and improves exploration efficiency.

Abstract: NASA aims to establish a sustainable human basecamp on the Moon as a stepping
stone for future missions to Mars and beyond. The discovery of water ice on the
Moon's craters located in permanently shadowed regions, which can provide
drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel, is therefore of critical importance.
However, current methods to access lunar ice deposits are limited. While rovers
have been used to explore the lunar surface for decades, they face significant
challenges in navigating harsh terrains, such as permanently shadowed craters,
due to the high risk of immobilization. This report introduces COBRA (Crater
Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a multi-modal snake-style robot
designed to overcome mobility challenges in Shackleton Crater's rugged
environment. COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to
various crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or
low inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by
linking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep
slopes. Equipped with an onboard computer, stereo camera, inertial measurement
unit, and joint encoders, COBRA facilitates real-time data collection and
autonomous operation. This paper highlights COBRAs robustness and efficiency in
navigating extreme terrains through both simulations and experimental
validation.

*Noriaki Hirose,Catherine Glossop,Dhruv Shah,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniVLA is a vision-language-action foundation model for omni-modal goal-conditioned navigation, trained with randomized fusion across 2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language to enable flexible, multimodal navigation and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic navigation often relies on a single modality for goal specification, but real-world tasks involve diverse, complementary modalities (language, coordinates, visual cues). A flexible, multimodal foundation model could improve adaptability and data efficiency.

Method: Train a high-capacity vision-language-action backbone (VLA) with three primary goal modalities—2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language—and their combinations, using randomized modality fusion to encourage shared representations and cross-modal transfer across datasets.

Result: OmniVLA generalizes to unseen environments, is robust to scarce modalities, and can follow novel natural language instructions. It outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and can be fine-tuned to new modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: OmniVLA represents a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation policies and provides a scalable path for omni-modal robotic foundation models; the authors plan to release checkpoints and training code.

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such
as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when
navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation
policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to
real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural
and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic
foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based
navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA)
backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric
images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a
randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of
usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric,
semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves
strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities,
and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate
that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a
flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe
OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation
policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation
models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its
checkpoints and training code on our project page.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HPC-augmented, millisecond-scale reactive planning for robotics: SHARP demonstrates sub-40 ms planning latencies and high success in dodging fast projectiles, supporting a hybrid onboard-HPC control architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Onboard robots face power/size/cost limits that impede real-time responsiveness; HPC offers parallelism for planning but introduces network latency/jitter that may hamper real-time control. This study probes feasibility and performance ceiling of HPC-driven planning.

Method: Parallel multi-goal A* search implemented with MPI on local and remote HPC clusters; stress-test with a 7-DOF manipulator dodging high-speed foam projectiles; report per-stage timing and success rates to assess real-time viability.

Result: Mean planning latencies: 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote ~300 km); success rates: 84% and 88%, respectively. Findings suggest that when round-trip latency stays in tens of milliseconds, HPC-side computation is not the bottleneck, enabling reactive behavior well below human reaction times.

Conclusion: HPC offloading is a viable pathway for dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments when combined with onboard safety reflexes; SHARP advocates a hybrid control architecture and provides a reproducible template to assess real-time feasibility of HPC-driven robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents SHARP (Supercomputing for High-speed Avoidance and
Reactive Planning), a proof-of-concept study demonstrating how high-performance
computing (HPC) can enable millisecond-scale responsiveness in robotic control.
While modern robots face increasing demands for reactivity in human--robot
shared workspaces, onboard processors are constrained by size, power, and cost.
Offloading to HPC offers massive parallelism for trajectory planning, but its
feasibility for real-time robotics remains uncertain due to network latency and
jitter. We evaluate SHARP in a stress-test scenario where a 7-DOF manipulator
must dodge high-speed foam projectiles. Using a parallelized multi-goal A*
search implemented with MPI on both local and remote HPC clusters, the system
achieves mean planning latencies of 22.9 ms (local) and 30.0 ms (remote, ~300
km away), with avoidance success rates of 84% and 88%, respectively. These
results show that when round-trip latency remains within the
tens-of-milliseconds regime, HPC-side computation is no longer the bottleneck,
enabling avoidance well below human reaction times. The SHARP results motivate
hybrid control architectures: low-level reflexes remain onboard for safety,
while bursty, high-throughput planning tasks are offloaded to HPC for
scalability. By reporting per-stage timing and success rates, this study
provides a reproducible template for assessing real-time feasibility of
HPC-driven robotics. Collectively, SHARP reframes HPC offloading as a viable
pathway toward dependable, reactive robots in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Curriculum-based Maximum Diffusion RL enables reliable single-shot on-hardware dynamic balancing in a soft Stewart platform, robust to actuator failures, trained in ~15 minutes with performance near the intact system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots exhibit strong nonlinearities, hysteresis, and dynamic behavior that challenge analytic control. Traditional methods avoid parts of the configuration space to reduce nonlinearity, and data-driven RL often suffers from sample inefficiency and inconsistency across initializations. The work aims to enable reliable, real-time, single-deployment control on hardware.

Method: A deformable Stewart platform built from parallel 3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic structures is controlled via curriculum learning—expanding neighborhoods around a known equilibrium. The study benchmarks model-based and model-free methods and shows Maximum Diffusion RL can learn dynamic balancing in a single deployment even after actuators are effectively disabled, by buckling or being cut. Training is performed on hardware with no prior data, in roughly 15 minutes.

Result: The approach achieves reliable single-deployment dynamic balancing at arbitrary coordinates, with performance nearly identical to the fully intact platform. It demonstrates robustness to actuator failures (e.g., half actuators disabled, buckling, or physical breakage) after rapid hardware training.

Conclusion: Single-shot hardware learning for soft robotics is viable, enabling more diverse and capable soft robots by allowing reliable real-world learning without extensive simulation or scripted data.

Abstract: Closed-loop control remains an open challenge in soft robotics. The nonlinear
responses of soft actuators under dynamic loading conditions limit the use of
analytic models for soft robot control. Traditional methods of controlling soft
robots underutilize their configuration spaces to avoid nonlinearity,
hysteresis, large deformations, and the risk of actuator damage. Furthermore,
episodic data-driven control approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) are
traditionally limited by sample efficiency and inconsistency across
initializations. In this work, we demonstrate RL for reliably learning control
policies for dynamic balancing tasks in real-time single-shot hardware
deployments. We use a deformable Stewart platform constructed using parallel,
3D-printed soft actuators based on motorized handed shearing auxetic (HSA)
structures. By introducing a curriculum learning approach based on expanding
neighborhoods of a known equilibrium, we achieve reliable single-deployment
balancing at arbitrary coordinates. In addition to benchmarking the performance
of model-based and model-free methods, we demonstrate that in a single
deployment, Maximum Diffusion RL is capable of learning dynamic balancing after
half of the actuators are effectively disabled, by inducing buckling and by
breaking actuators with bolt cutters. Training occurs with no prior data, in as
fast as 15 minutes, with performance nearly identical to the fully-intact
platform. Single-shot learning on hardware facilitates soft robotic systems
reliably learning in the real world and will enable more diverse and capable
soft robots.

Result: The approach demonstrates automated chemical mapping with LIBS, enabling controlled chemical quantification and tying lab measurements to field measurements using the same handheld device, thus linking exploration and processing steps in the lithium materials supply chain.

Conclusion: The architecture and platform offer a cost-effective, generalizable pathway for automated laboratory characterization, enabling scalable lab-to-field workflows in resource materials and similar domains.

Abstract: Despite the rapidly growing applications of robots in industry, the use of
robots to automate tasks in scientific laboratories is less prolific due to
lack of generalized methodologies and high cost of hardware. This paper focuses
on the automation of characterization tasks necessary for reducing cost while
maintaining generalization, and proposes a software architecture for building
robotic systems in scientific laboratory environment. A dual-layer (Socket.IO
and ROS) action server design is the basic building block, which facilitates
the implementation of a web-based front end for user-friendly operations and
the use of ROS Behavior Tree for convenient task planning and execution. A
robotic platform for automating mineral and material sample characterization is
built upon the architecture, with an open source, low-cost three-axis computer
numerical control gantry system serving as the main robot. A handheld laser
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analyzer is integrated with a 3D printed
adapter, enabling automated 2D chemical mapping. We demonstrate the utility of
automated chemical mapping by scanning of the surface of a spodumene-bearing
pegmatite core sample with a 1071-point dense hyperspectral map acquired at a
rate of 1520 bits per second. Automated LIBS scanning enables controlled
chemical quantification in the laboratory that complements field-based

*Sankalp Agrawal,Junwon Seo,Kensuke Nakamura,Ran Tian,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A runtime-adaptive latent safety filter for vision-based control that learns constraint-parameterized safety in a world-model latent space, enabling user-specified constraints via constraint-image encodings and conformal calibration; trained in imagination and validated on a Franka manipulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, safety constraints in latent-space reachability are fixed and known a priori, hindering adaptability across diverse scenes and tasks. There's a need for safety filters that can adapt to user-defined constraints at runtime while preserving performance.

Method: Define safety constraints by conditioning on an encoding of a constraint image using latent-space similarity; employ conformal calibration to bound proximity to constraints; train entirely in the world model's imagination, treating any image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint; at runtime, adapt by feeding user-specified constraint images to the encoder.

Result: Showed runtime adaptation to constraint images in simulation and hardware with a Franka manipulator on vision-based control tasks, maintaining performance while accommodating arbitrary safety constraints; video available.

Conclusion: Constraint-parameterized latent safety filters enable flexible, runtime-adaptive safety under vision-based control, extending applicability of latent safety methods across scenarios with minimal performance loss; requires robust world-model and calibration for reliability.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space
of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for
hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is
known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety
filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose
constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified
safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by
conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a
latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned
in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely
the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety
filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any
image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling
runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware
experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show
that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of
user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance. Video

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Agentic Scene Policies (ASP) introduce a framework that uses rich, queryable scene representations with affordances to enable language-conditioned robot policies. It supports zero-shot open-vocabulary queries and affordance-guided navigation, and is shown through experiments to handle both tabletop manipulation and room-scale tasks, with a scalable scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end policies (imitation learning and vision-language-action models) struggle with complex instructions and novel environments. There is a need for explicit, queryable scene representations that can be leveraged to guide planning and control via affordances and semantics.

Method: ASP leverages advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying of modern scene representations to implement a language-conditioned robot policy. It enables zero-shot open-vocabulary queries and explicit reasoning about object affordances for complex skills. The work includes comparisons with VLAs on tabletop manipulation and demonstrations of room-level queries through affordance-guided navigation and a scalable scene representation.

Result: Extensive experiments compare ASP with VLAs on tabletop manipulation, demonstrating ASP’s ability to address room-level queries via affordance-guided navigation and validating the scalability of the scene representation.

Conclusion: ASP provides a viable alternative to end-to-end VLA approaches by offering an explicit, queryable scene representation that supports open-vocabulary, affordance-aware, language-conditioned policies and scales to larger scenes.

Abstract: Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics.
While recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models
(VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when
faced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an
explicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and
the world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this
work, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that
leverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying
capabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable
language-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a
zero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case
of more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs
on tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level
queries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene
representation. (Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A CLF-guided RL framework for humanoid locomotion that uses control Lyapunov functions and optimized reference trajectories to shape rewards, yielding robust, dynamically feasible running and movement with onboard sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots require robust, precise control for highly dynamic locomotion. Classical methods help stability but struggle with nonlinear/hybrid dynamics; RL can handle complexity but often lacks stability guarantees and meaningful reward signals.

Method: Embed ideas from nonlinear control (control Lyapunov functions) and optimized dynamic reference trajectories into RL training to shape the reward, eliminating manual reward engineering and promoting certifiable stability; ground policy learning in dynamically feasible trajectories.

Result: Policy runs on a treadmill and outdoors; robust to disturbances to the torso and feet; achieves accurate global reference tracking using only onboard sensors.

Conclusion: CLF-RL provides stability certifiability and meaningful intermediate rewards, expands dynamic capabilities (including running with flight and single-support phases), and advances toward integrating such dynamic motions into a full autonomy stack.

Abstract: Achieving highly dynamic behaviors on humanoid robots, such as running,
requires controllers that are both robust and precise, and hence difficult to
design. Classical control methods offer valuable insight into how such systems
can stabilize themselves, but synthesizing real-time controllers for nonlinear
and hybrid dynamics remains challenging. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)
has gained popularity for locomotion control due to its ability to handle these
complex dynamics. In this work, we embed ideas from nonlinear control theory,
specifically control Lyapunov functions (CLFs), along with optimized dynamic
reference trajectories into the reinforcement learning training process to
shape the reward. This approach, CLF-RL, eliminates the need to handcraft and
tune heuristic reward terms, while simultaneously encouraging certifiable
stability and providing meaningful intermediate rewards to guide learning. By
grounding policy learning in dynamically feasible trajectories, we expand the
robot's dynamic capabilities and enable running that includes both flight and
single support phases. The resulting policy operates reliably on a treadmill
and in outdoor environments, demonstrating robustness to disturbances applied
to the torso and feet. Moreover, it achieves accurate global reference tracking
utilizing only on-board sensors, making a critical step toward integrating
these dynamic motions into a full autonomy stack.

*Chad R. Samuelson,Abigail Austin,Seth Knoop,Blake Romrell,Gabriel R. Slade,Timothy W. McLain,Joshua G. Mangelson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Outdoor autonomous robots benefit from terrain-aware 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) that extend indoor techniques to outdoor mapping, yielding a lightweight metric-semantic 3DSG for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geometric maps lack semantic structure needed for high-level robotic reasoning. Outdoor tasks require terrain-aware reasoning and integrated semantic relationships, but existing 3DSGs are largely developed for indoor environments. This work aims to bridge that gap by adding terrain awareness and outdoor compatibility.

Method: Combine indoor 3DSG techniques with outdoor geometric mapping and terrain-aware reasoning. Create terrain-aware place nodes and hierarchically organized regions. Build a task-agnostic, metric-semantic sparse map and construct a 3DSG from it for downstream planning, in a lightweight framework suitable for autonomous operation.

Result: The proposed method matches state-of-the-art camera-based 3DSGs in object retrieval and surpasses them in region classification while maintaining memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach is effective across diverse robotic tasks (object retrieval and region monitoring) and is validated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: Outdoor intelligent autonomous robotic operation relies on a sufficiently
expressive map of the environment. Classical geometric mapping methods retain
essential structural environment information, but lack a semantic understanding
and organization to allow high-level robotic reasoning. 3D scene graphs (3DSGs)
address this limitation by integrating geometric, topological, and semantic
relationships into a multi-level graph-based map. Outdoor autonomous operations
commonly rely on terrain information either due to task-dependence or the
traversability of the robotic platform. We propose a novel approach that
combines indoor 3DSG techniques with standard outdoor geometric mapping and
terrain-aware reasoning, producing terrain-aware place nodes and hierarchically
organized regions for outdoor environments. Our method generates a
task-agnostic metric-semantic sparse map and constructs a 3DSG from this map
for downstream planning tasks, all while remaining lightweight for autonomous
robotic operation. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates our 3DSG method
performs on par with state-of-the-art camera-based 3DSG methods in object
retrieval and surpasses them in region classification while remaining memory
efficient. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse robotic tasks of object
retrieval and region monitoring in both simulation and real-world environments.

TL;DR:  SPACE2TIME reparameterizes spatial disturbances as temporal variations to enable online use of offline-learned safety filters under unknown, spatially-varying disturbances; validated on a quadcopter with simulations and hardware, showing improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value-function-based safety filters can guarantee safety but rely on detailed priors about disturbances; real-world environments have unknown, spatially varying disturbances (payload-dynamics, turbulence) that degrade safety guarantees.

Method: Introduce a reparameterization that converts spatial disturbance variations into temporal variations, enabling the use of precomputed safety value functions during online operation; apply this to offline-learned safety filters for high-dimensional systems (e.g., quadcopter).

Result: Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on a quadcopter indicate significant improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: SPACE2TIME enables safe, adaptive deployment of offline safety filters under unknown, spatially varying disturbances and has potential for robust, high-dimensional autonomous systems in real-world environments.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical
environments such as urban air mobility hinges on ensuring reliable,
performant, and safe operation under varying environmental conditions. One such
approach, value function-based safety filters, minimally modifies a nominal
controller to ensure safety. Recent advances leverage offline learned value
functions to scale these safety filters to high-dimensional systems. However,
these methods assume detailed priors on all possible sources of model mismatch,
in the form of disturbances in the environment -- information that is rarely
available in real world settings. Even in well-mapped environments like urban
canyons or industrial sites, drones encounter complex, spatially-varying
disturbances arising from payload-drone interaction, turbulent airflow, and
other environmental factors. We introduce SPACE2TIME, which enables safe and
adaptive deployment of offline-learned safety filters under unknown,
spatially-varying disturbances. The key idea is to reparameterize spatial
variations in disturbance as temporal variations, enabling the use of
precomputed value functions during online operation. We validate SPACE2TIME on
a quadcopter through extensive simulations and hardware experiments,
demonstrating significant improvement over baselines.

TL;DR: PS-PRM: a GPU-parallelized, perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate model for high-DoF robots in dynamic environments to integrate perception quality into motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable simultaneous navigation and perception for high-DoF robots in dynamic environments, addressing conflicts between motion planning and perception constraints, and overcoming limitations of existing methods that neglect obstacles, are designed for low-DoF, or rely on simplified perception models.

Method: Introduce PS-PRM, a GPU-parallelized probabilistic roadmap planner guided by estimated perception quality. Uses a neural surrogate model to approximate perception scores and integrates them into planning, enabling efficient online replanning in dynamic settings for high-DoF robots.

Result: The PS-PRM planner outperforms baselines in both static and dynamic environments, demonstrated in simulation and real-robot experiments, with improved planning efficiency and perception-aware motion.

Conclusion: A perception-aware motion planning framework for high-DoF robots that leverages a neural surrogate and GPU parallelism achieves robust performance and fast replanning in dynamic environments, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of planning robot motions for a
high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot that effectively achieves a given perception
task while the robot and the perception target move in a dynamic environment.
Achieving navigation and perception tasks simultaneously is challenging, as
these objectives often impose conflicting requirements. Existing methods that
compute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are
designed for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception.
Furthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react
quickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g.,
object detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This
problem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes
and hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable
operation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized
perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate
model (PS-PRM). The planner explicitly incorporates the estimated quality of a
perception task into motion planning for high-DoF robots. Our method uses a
learned model to approximate perception scores and leverages GPU parallelism to
enable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings. We demonstrate that our
planner, evaluated on high-DoF robots, outperforms baseline methods in both
static and dynamic environments in both simulation and real-robot experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EgoBridge is a unified co-training framework that aligns human and robot policy latent spaces using Optimal Transport-based domain adaptation, enabling improved end-to-end imitation from egocentric human data with 44% absolute policy success gain and generalization to unseen objects/scenes/tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain gaps in appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between human egocentric data and robot embodiments hinder knowledge transfer for imitation learning from human data.

Method: A co-training framework that measures discrepancy between joint policy latent features and actions via Optimal Transport to learn observation representations that align human and robot domains while preserving action-relevant information for policy learning.

Result: Achieves a 44% absolute improvement in policy success over strong baselines across three real-world manipulation tasks (single-arm and bimanual). Generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks present only in human data, where baselines fail.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning latent policy representations across domains via OT-based discrepancy is effective for cross-embodiment imitation, enabling robust transfer from egocentric human data to robotic manipulation and generalization to unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up
end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant
domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between
human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a
unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces
between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of
discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal
Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align
between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant
information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant
absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented
cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual
manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and
tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A minimal autonomous racing stack enables rapid deployment with limited on-track testing and real-world validation. It achieved 206 km/h after 11 hours of practice and 325 km of total track time, with accompanying performance and safety analyses to guide rapid deployment for teams with constrained track access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a strong need to shorten development cycles and reduce dependence on extensive track time for autonomous racing, given limited access to dedicated test facilities.

Method: Develop a minimalistic, well-integrated racing stack focused on rapid deployment. Validate on real speedways, analyze tracking accuracy, vehicle dynamics, and safety considerations, and emphasize efficient system integration with minimal on-track testing.

Result: Demonstrated high-speed performance (206 km/h) within 11 hours of practice and 325 km of on-track testing; provided system performance metrics and safety considerations to guide rapid development.

Conclusion: The work offers a practical blueprint for teams to quickly develop and deploy autonomous racing stacks under track-time constraints, bridging the gap between concept and real-world high-speed validation.

Abstract: Autonomous racing has seen significant advancements, driven by competitions
such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) and the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing
League (A2RL). However, developing an autonomous racing stack for a full-scale
car is often constrained by limited access to dedicated test tracks,
restricting opportunities for real-world validation. While previous work
typically requires extended development cycles and significant track time, this
paper introduces a minimalistic autonomous racing stack for high-speed
time-trial racing that emphasizes rapid deployment and efficient system
integration with minimal on-track testing. The proposed stack was validated on
real speedways, achieving a top speed of 206 km/h within just 11 hours'
practice run on the track with 325 km in total. Additionally, we present the
system performance analysis, including tracking accuracy, vehicle dynamics, and
safety considerations, offering insights for teams seeking to rapidly develop
and deploy an autonomous racing stack with limited track access.

*Youngju Yoo,Jiaheng Hu,Yifeng Zhu,Bo Liu,Qiang Liu,Roberto Martín-Martín,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboSSM replaces Transformers in in-context imitation learning with a state-space model (Longhorn), enabling scalable, long-context inference and better extrapolation to more demonstrations without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in ICIL struggle with computational costs and degraded performance on long prompts; there is a need for a scalable backbone that can handle long-context demonstrations.

Method: Replace Transformer with Longhorn-based state-space model in the ICIL pipeline, achieving linear-time inference and strong extrapolation to longer prompts; evaluate on LIBERO against Transformer baselines.

Result: RoboSSM demonstrates effective extrapolation to varying numbers of demonstrations, strong performance on unseen tasks, and robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to Transformer-based baselines.

Conclusion: State-space models like Longhorn are a viable, efficient backbone for ICIL, offering scalable inference and improved handling of long prompts.

Abstract: In-context imitation learning (ICIL) enables robots to learn tasks from
prompts consisting of just a handful of demonstrations. By eliminating the need
for parameter updates at deployment time, this paradigm supports few-shot
adaptation to novel tasks. However, recent ICIL methods rely on Transformers,
which have computational limitations and tend to underperform when handling
longer prompts than those seen during training. In this work, we introduce
RoboSSM, a scalable recipe for in-context imitation learning based on
state-space models (SSM). Specifically, RoboSSM replaces Transformers with
Longhorn -- a state-of-the-art SSM that provides linear-time inference and
strong extrapolation capabilities, making it well-suited for long-context
prompts. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark and compare it
against strong Transformer-based ICIL baselines. Experiments show that RoboSSM
extrapolates effectively to varying numbers of in-context demonstrations,
yields high performance on unseen tasks, and remains robust in long-horizon
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of SSMs as an efficient and
scalable backbone for ICIL. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory (MAPFT) augments stochastic optimal control with memory-based potential fields to escape local optima in non-convex landscapes, implemented via a Memory-Augmented MPPI controller, yielding improved performance without extensive offline training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic optimal control methods often get trapped in local optima in complex non-convex landscapes and underutilize historical trajectory data. The work proposes integrating past experience to guide optimization.

Method: Develop Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory to dynamically construct memory-based potential fields that encode topological features of the state space, enabling experience-based learning; provide theoretical analysis of non-convex escape properties, convergence, and efficiency; implement in a Memory-Augmented MPPI controller.

Result: The approach yields significantly improved performance in challenging non-convex environments and offers a generalizable framework for experience-based learning in control systems, especially robotics, without requiring specialized domain knowledge or heavy offline training.

Conclusion: MAPFT provides a general-purpose, memory-informed framework to improve stochastic optimal control in non-convex settings, enabling controllers to learn from past experiences and navigate complex state spaces more effectively.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control methods often struggle in complex non-convex
landscapes, frequently becoming trapped in local optima due to their inability
to learn from historical trajectory data. This paper introduces
Memory-Augmented Potential Field Theory, a unified mathematical framework that
integrates historical experience into stochastic optimal control. Our approach
dynamically constructs memory-based potential fields that identify and encode
key topological features of the state space, enabling controllers to
automatically learn from past experiences and adapt their optimization
strategy. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that memory-augmented
potential fields possess non-convex escape properties, asymptotic convergence
characteristics, and computational efficiency. We implement this theoretical
framework in a Memory-Augmented Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
controller that demonstrates significantly improved performance in challenging
non-convex environments. The framework represents a generalizable approach to
experience-based learning within control systems (especially robotic dynamics),
enhancing their ability to navigate complex state spaces without requiring

### [99] [Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners via Certified Local Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19688)
*Devesh Nath,Haoran Yin,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scalable method to formally verify safety of learning-based generative motion planners by stabilizing GMP references with a small neural tracking controller and verifying the closed-loop dynamics; builds a library of verified references and online imitation to improve safety without retraining, validated across diverse planners and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GMPs are expressive and powerful but safety and dynamic feasibility are hard to certify because neural networks scale poorly for verification, making traditional NNV ineffective for large GMPs.

Method: Imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller, then apply neural-network verification to the closed-loop dynamics to obtain rigorous safety guarantees. Build a library of verified GMP references and deploy online by mimicking the GMP distribution whenever it is safe, avoiding retraining.

Result: Evaluation across diverse planners (diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models) shows improved safety in simulation (ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable formal safety verification for GMPs while preserving expressiveness, providing practical safety improvements without retraining through a verified-reference library and online imitation.

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based
generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages
over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of
their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale
only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve
GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate
the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural
tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This
yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the
controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a
library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that
imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving
safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including
diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in
simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware
(differential-drive robot).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Diffusion-based impedance learning unifies data-driven motion generation with energy-based impedance adaptation for physical interaction, enabling real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness tuning on a robotic platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between learning-based motion generation (information domain) and task-aware physical interaction (energy/impedance domain) by coupling a diffusion-based trajectory model with an impedance-adaptation loop.

Method: A Transformer-based diffusion model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT) capturing translational and rotational task-space behavior. Rotations use a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler to preserve geometric consistency. An energy-based estimator updates stiffness and damping; a directional rule reduces impedance along non-task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data from parkour and robot-assisted therapy teleoperation (Apple Vision Pro). Real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa. 

Result: Achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy with tens of thousands of samples. Model is compact enough for real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation. Demonstrated smooth parkour traversal within force/velocity limits and 30/30 success in peg insertions (cylindrical, square, star) without peg-specific demonstrations. Code for the diffusion model, controller, and telemanipulation framework publicly released.

Conclusion: A notable step toward Physical AI, integrating model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based trajectory generation to enable adaptive, task-aware impedance control.

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are
not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance
Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting
feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a
framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with
cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force
Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space
behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise
scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then
passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping
parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task
axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were
collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using
teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples,
the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational
accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and
autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller
achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30
success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any
peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the
Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision
Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an
important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TopoCut provides a unified benchmark for multi-step robotic cutting of deformable objects, integrating a high-fidelity elastoplastic simulator with topology-aware perception and topology-aware reward-based learning, enabling trajectory generation, scalable learning, and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic cutting of deformable objects is challenging due to complex topology changes during cutting, difficulties in perceiving dense object states, and the lack of efficient, objective evaluation methods for cutting outcomes.

Method: (1) A high-fidelity particle-based elastoplastic simulation environment with compliant von Mises constitutive models and a damage-driven topology discovery module to accurately track multiple cutting pieces. (2) A topology-aware reward design that blends topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral reward based on Laplace-Beltrami eigenanalysis to robustly assess cutting quality. (3) An integrated policy-learning pipeline where a dynamics-informed perception module predicts topology evolution and generates particle-wise topology-aware embeddings to support PDDP (Particle-based Score-Entropy Discrete Diffusion Policy) for goal-conditioned learning.

Result: Experiments show that TopoCut supports trajectory generation, scalable learning, precise evaluation, and strong generalization across diverse object geometries, scales, poses, and cutting goals.

Conclusion: TopoCut offers a comprehensive benchmark that unifies simulation, evaluation, and learning for robust multi-step robotic cutting tasks on deformable objects, enabling consistent assessment and generalization across varied scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks involving cutting deformable objects remain
challenging due to complex topological behaviors, difficulties in perceiving
dense object states, and the lack of efficient evaluation methods for cutting
outcomes. In this paper, we introduce TopoCut, a comprehensive benchmark for
multi-step robotic cutting tasks that integrates a cutting environment and
generalized policy learning. TopoCut is built upon three core components: (1)
We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment based on a particle-based
elastoplastic solver with compliant von Mises constitutive models, augmented by
a novel damage-driven topology discovery mechanism that enables accurate
tracking of multiple cutting pieces. (2) We develop a comprehensive reward
design that integrates the topology discovery with a pose-invariant spectral

*Naveed D. Riaziat,Joseph Chen,Axel Krieger,Jeremy D. Brown*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ThERMO uses thermography feedback to autonomously modulate electrosurgical tool velocity, balancing cutting performance and thermal safety. In tissue phantoms it tripled cut success rate and halved peak cutting force versus constant-velocity control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrosurgery improves cutting and reduces bleeding but risks thermal injury. There is no quantitative reference for an optimal cutting velocity, and previous autonomous systems used constant velocity, which is not robust to tissue characteristics, power settings, or tool type.

Method: Introduce Thermography for Electrosurgical Rate Modulation via Optimization (ThERMO). It leverages thermal imaging feedback to optimize tool velocity, reducing thermal injury while balancing cutting force. Demonstrated in tissue phantoms and compared against a constant-velocity baseline.

Result: ThERMO increased cut success rate by ~3x and reduced peak cutting force by ~2x. It responded to environmental disturbances, reduced tissue damage, and completed cutting tasks that failed under constant velocity.

Conclusion: ThERMO provides robust, autonomous velocity control for electrosurgery, decreasing thermal injury while maintaining cutting efficacy. It shows promise for safer, more reliable autonomous electrosurgical systems; in vivo validation may be a future step.

Abstract: Electrosurgery is a surgical technique that can improve tissue cutting by
reducing cutting force and bleeding. However, electrosurgery adds a risk of
thermal injury to surrounding tissue. Expert surgeons estimate desirable
cutting velocities based on experience but have no quantifiable reference to
indicate if a particular velocity is optimal. Furthermore, prior demonstrations
of autonomous electrosurgery have primarily used constant tool velocity, which
is not robust to changes in electrosurgical tissue characteristics, power
settings, or tool type. Thermal imaging feedback provides information that can
be used to reduce thermal injury while balancing cutting force by controlling
tool velocity. We introduce Thermography for Electrosurgical Rate Modulation
via Optimization (ThERMO) to autonomously reduce thermal injury while balancing
cutting force by intelligently controlling tool velocity. We demonstrate ThERMO
in tissue phantoms and compare its performance to the constant velocity
approach. Overall, ThERMO improves cut success rate by a factor of three and
can reduce peak cutting force by a factor of two. ThERMO responds to varying
environmental disturbances, reduces damage to tissue, and completes cutting
tasks that would otherwise result in catastrophic failure for the constant
velocity approach.

### [103] [Simultaneous estimation of contact position and tool shape with high-dimensional parameters using force measurements and particle filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19732)
*Kyo Kutsuzawa,Mitsuhiro Hayashibe*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A particle-filter-based method estimates both the contact position and the high-dimensional tool shape (represented on a grid) from force/torque data, enabling simultaneous shape and contact-state estimation for grasped tools without relying on known tool geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating contact state for grasped tools is crucial for assembly/manipulation. Existing methods either require known tool geometry or are slow/limited to low-dimensional shapes. There is a need to jointly estimate tool shape and contact position from forces to handle obscured contacts and diverse tools.

Method: Represent tool shape with a high-dimensional grid (>1000D). Use a particle filter where each particle carries its own tool-shape parameters, avoiding explicit high-dimensional optimization. The filter uses force/torque signals to infer contact position and shape, and updates particles accordingly, enabling simultaneous estimation.

Result: Through simulations and experiments with curved tools on a plane, the approach accurately estimates both tool shape and contact positions, improving contact-position estimation accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that simultaneous estimation of tool shape and contact position is feasible with a particle-filter approach. It broadens applicability to curved tools and obscured contacts and can enhance real-time contact-state estimation in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the contact state between a grasped tool and the environment is
essential for performing contact tasks such as assembly and object
manipulation. Force signals are valuable for estimating the contact state, as
they can be utilized even when the contact location is obscured by the tool.
Previous studies proposed methods for estimating contact positions using
force/torque signals; however, most methods require the geometry of the tool
surface to be known. Although several studies have proposed methods that do not
require the tool shape, these methods require considerable time for estimation
or are limited to tools with low-dimensional shape parameters. Here, we propose
a method for simultaneously estimating the contact position and tool shape,
where the tool shape is represented by a grid, which is high-dimensional (more
than 1000 dimensional). The proposed method uses a particle filter in which
each particle has individual tool shape parameters, thereby to avoid directly
handling a high-dimensional parameter space. The proposed method is evaluated
through simulations and experiments using tools with curved shapes on a plane.
Consequently, the proposed method can estimate the shape of the tool
simultaneously with the contact positions, making the contact-position
estimation more accurate.

*Akshay Jaitly,Jon Arrizabalaga,Guanrui Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a trajectory parameterization where nonconvex collision-free corridors are represented as a convex Cartesian product of balls, enabling continuous trajectories without explicit time allocation; coupled with Orth-TRP, a specialized convex program with separable blocks and a parallel solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability issues of corridor-based planners that decompose free space into collision-free subsets and require explicit time-window allocations, by decoupling problem size from geometric complexity and enabling continuous trajectory evolution inside ellipsoidal corridors.

Method: Represent trajectories inside ellipsoidal corridors as a convex product of balls (nonconvex corridor represented by a convex Cartesian product of balls). Formulate Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a convex program with separable block constraints, and develop a parallel solver that exploits the block structure and per-subproblem specifics.

Result: On a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark, the approach yields smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than state-of-the-art corridor-based planners, with pronounced advantages in highly complex environments.

Conclusion: The proposed parameterization and Orth-TRP solver provide a scalable, efficient framework for collision-free trajectory planning in complex environments, reducing dependence on environmental geometry while delivering improved performance.

Abstract: Planning collision free trajectories in complex environments remains a core
challenge in robotics. Existing corridor based planners which rely on
decomposition of the free space into collision free subsets scale poorly with
environmental complexity and require explicit allocations of time windows to
trajectory segments. We introduce a new trajectory parameterization that
represents trajectories in a nonconvex collision free corridor as being in a
convex cartesian product of balls. This parameterization allows us to decouple
problem size from geometric complexity of the solution and naturally avoids
explicit time allocation by allowing trajectories to evolve continuously inside
ellipsoidal corridors. Building on this representation, we formulate the
Orthogonal Trust Region Problem (Orth-TRP), a specialized convex program with
separable block constraints, and develop a solver that exploits this parallel
structure and the unique structure of each parallel subproblem for efficient
optimization. Experiments on a quadrotor trajectory planning benchmark show
that our approach produces smoother trajectories and lower runtimes than
state-of-the-art corridor based planners, especially in highly complicated
environments.

TL;DR: Diffusion RL for autonomous demo generation improves VLA training, achieving 81.9% success on LIBERO and outperforming human and Gaussian RL data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models generalize across tasks but rely on costly human demonstrations; RL could generate data, but long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards are challenging.

Method: A modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm leveraging diffusion models to produce diverse, high-quality, low-variance trajectories; integrated into a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline; evaluated on LIBERO.

Result: Diffusion RL trajectories are smoother and more consistent than human or Gaussian RL; VLA trained on diffusion RL data reaches 81.9% average success, beating human data by 5.3% and Gaussian RL by 12.6%.

Conclusion: Diffusion RL is a scalable, effective source of demonstrations for VLA models, enabling abundant, high-quality data and improved generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization across
tasks and embodiments; however, their reliance on large-scale human
demonstrations limits their scalability owing to the cost and effort of manual
data collection. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to
generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often
struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper,
we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate
high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion
RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high
expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but
also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield
smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO
benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that
the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human
demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training
a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average
success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by
+5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight
our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant,
high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.

TL;DR: DynaFlow integrates a differentiable simulator into a flow-matching model to produce dynamically feasible, physically consistent trajectories from state-only demonstrations, enabling action inference and real-world deployment on a quadruped.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure physical feasibility in learned motions and bridge the gap between purely kinematic demonstrations and dynamic execution by enabling end-to-end training from state trajectories.

Method: Embed a differentiable physics simulator inside a flow-matching pipeline. Generate trajectories in action space and map them to dynamically feasible state trajectories via the simulator. Train end-to-end on state-only demonstrations to jointly synthesize state trajectories and the underlying action sequences. Validate with quantitative evaluations and real-world deployment on a Go1 quadruped.

Result: Quantitative results show effectiveness. Hardware experiments on a Go1 quadruped reproduce diverse gait from the dataset, perform long-horizon open-loop motions, and convert infeasible kinematic demonstrations into dynamically executable, stylistic behaviors.

Conclusion: DynaFlow provides deployable, effective motions from state-only demonstrations, closing the gap between kinematic data and real-world dynamic execution and enabling broader real-world deployment of learned motions.

Abstract: This paper introduces DynaFlow, a novel framework that embeds a
differentiable simulator directly into a flow matching model. By generating
trajectories in the action space and mapping them to dynamically feasible state
trajectories via the simulator, DynaFlow ensures all outputs are physically
consistent by construction. This end-to-end differentiable architecture enables
training on state-only demonstrations, allowing the model to simultaneously
generate physically consistent state trajectories while inferring the
underlying action sequences required to produce them. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through quantitative evaluations and showcase its
real-world applicability by deploying the generated actions onto a physical Go1
quadruped robot. The robot successfully reproduces diverse gait present in the
dataset, executes long-horizon motions in open-loop control and translates
infeasible kinematic demonstrations into dynamically executable, stylistic
behaviors. These hardware experiments validate that DynaFlow produces
deployable, highly effective motions on real-world hardware from state-only
demonstrations, effectively bridging the gap between kinematic data and

*Benjamin Bogenberger,Oliver Harrison,Orrin Dahanaggamaarachchi,Lukas Brunke,Jingxing Qian,Siqi Zhou,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An open-vocabulary semantic exploration system for semi-static environments that maintains a consistent, probabilistically modeled map of object instances, detects semi-static changes, and actively explores unvisited areas, while using LLM-based reasoning for open-vocabulary object-goal navigation; it achieves strong change detection, near-full map precision with less exploration, and faster object-goal navigation than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in real-world settings encounter objects that leave and reappear or move, breaking static-scene assumptions. A persistent, semantically rich map is essential for planning and task execution. Open-vocabulary reasoning enables flexible interaction with diverse objects beyond predefined categories.

Method: 1) Build a probabilistic model of object instance stationarity to maintain map consistency. 2) Systematically track semi-static changes in the environment. 3) Actively explore regions not visited for extended periods to refresh the map. 4) Leverage the semantically rich map with LLM-based reasoning to perform open-vocabulary object-goal navigation.

Result: Evaluated in real-world semi-static environments. The system detects ~95% of map changes on average. It improves exploration efficiency by >29% relative to random and patrol baselines. Mapping precision remains within 2% of a fully rebuilt map, while using substantially less exploration. Object-goal navigation tasks are completed ~14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage patrolling).

Conclusion: The approach effectively closes the gap in semantic exploration for semi-static scenes by maintaining a consistent semantic map, enabling efficient exploration and improved object-goal navigation using open-vocabulary reasoning. It demonstrates robustness to changes and offers practical potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Robots deployed in real-world environments, such as homes, must not only
navigate safely but also understand their surroundings and adapt to environment
changes. To perform tasks efficiently, they must build and maintain a semantic
map that accurately reflects the current state of the environment. Existing
research on semantic exploration largely focuses on static scenes without
persistent object-level instance tracking. A consistent map is, however,
crucial for real-world robotic applications where objects in the environment
can be removed, reintroduced, or shifted over time. In this work, to close this
gap, we propose an open-vocabulary, semantic exploration system for semi-static
environments. Our system maintains a consistent map by building a probabilistic
model of object instance stationarity, systematically tracking semi-static
changes, and actively exploring areas that have not been visited for a
prolonged period of time. In addition to active map maintenance, our approach
leverages the map's semantic richness with LLM-based reasoning for
open-vocabulary object-goal navigation. This enables the robot to search more
efficiently by prioritizing contextually relevant areas. We evaluate our
approach across multiple real-world semi-static environments. Our system
detects 95% of map changes on average, improving efficiency by more than 29% as
compared to random and patrol baselines. Overall, our approach achieves a
mapping precision within 2% of a fully rebuilt map while requiring
substantially less exploration and further completes object goal navigation
tasks about 14% faster than the next-best tested strategy (coverage
patrolling). A video of our work can be found at

*BinXu Wu,TengFei Zhang,Chen Yang,JiaHao Wen,HaoCheng Li,JingTian Ma,Zhen Chen,JingYuan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAGE frames multi-stage sequential manipulation as a Hidden Markov Decision Process to resolve latent task stages and state ambiguity, using a state transition network and a state-aware policy; it reduces labeling effort via a semi-automatic labeling pipeline and achieves perfect task success in real-world MSS tasks, with strong ablations showing robustness to reduced labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address state ambiguity in multi-stage robotic manipulation, where visually similar observations map to different actions, by explicitly modeling latent task stages and reducing annotation burden.

Method: Modeling MSS tasks as an HMDP with a hidden-state transition network that infers latent states and a state-aware policy that conditions actions on both observations and latent states. Introduce a semi-automatic labeling pipeline combining active learning with soft label interpolation to minimize manual annotations.

Result: Real-world experiments across complex MSS tasks with state ambiguity show 100% task success under standard evaluation, outperforming baselines. Ablation studies indicate comparable performance with manual labeling for only ~13% of states.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling latent task stages with a state-aware policy and a semi-automatic labeling strategy effectively resolves ambiguity in MSS tasks and substantially reduces labeling effort while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-stage sequential (MSS) robotic manipulation tasks are prevalent and
crucial in robotics. They often involve state ambiguity, where visually similar
observations correspond to different actions. We present SAGE, a state-aware
guided imitation learning framework that models tasks as a Hidden Markov
Decision Process (HMDP) to explicitly capture latent task stages and resolve
ambiguity. We instantiate the HMDP with a state transition network that infers
hidden states, and a state-aware action policy that conditions on both
observations and hidden states to produce actions, thereby enabling
disambiguation across task stages. To reduce manual annotation effort, we
propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline combining active learning and soft
label interpolation. In real-world experiments across multiple complex MSS
tasks with state ambiguity, SAGE achieved 100% task success under the standard
evaluation protocol, markedly surpassing the baselines. Ablation studies
further show that such performance can be maintained with manual labeling for
only about 13% of the states, indicating its strong effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle high-dimensional action spaces and perception uncertainty in dexterous grasping of deformable objects by fusing multimodal sensing and training-time privileged information to improve generalization and sample efficiency.

Method: A multimodal representation that fuses visual and tactile inputs, an asymmetric reinforcement learning architecture that uses privileged information during training while remaining deployable, and a training strategy to synthesize contact-rich, penetration-free, and kinematically feasible grasps adaptable to deformable objects.

Result: D3Grasp shows robust performance across diverse object categories, outperforms prior methods on rigid and deformable benchmarks, and achieves an average real-world success rate of 95.1% in trials.

Conclusion: D3Grasp advances dexterous grasping for deformable and compliant objects under perceptual uncertainty and disturbances, with improved generalization and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Achieving diverse and stable dexterous grasping for general and deformable
objects remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, due to high-dimensional
action spaces and uncertainty in perception. In this paper, we present D3Grasp,
a multimodal perception-guided reinforcement learning framework designed to
enable Diverse and Deformable Dexterous Grasping. We firstly introduce a
unified multimodal representation that integrates visual and tactile perception
to robustly grasp common objects with diverse properties. Second, we propose an
asymmetric reinforcement learning architecture that exploits privileged
information during training while preserving deployment realism, enhancing both
generalization and sample efficiency. Third, we meticulously design a training
strategy to synthesize contact-rich, penetration-free, and kinematically
feasible grasps with enhanced adaptability to deformable and contact-sensitive
objects. Extensive evaluations confirm that D3Grasp delivers highly robust
performance across large-scale and diverse object categories, and substantially
advances the state of the art in dexterous grasping for deformable and
compliant objects, even under perceptual uncertainty and real-world
disturbances. D3Grasp achieves an average success rate of 95.1% in real-world
trials,outperforming prior methods on both rigid and deformable objects
benchmarks.

*Zijun Che,Yinghong Zhang,Shengyi Liang,Boyu Zhou,Jun Ma,Jinni Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDE introduces a global graph-based exploration framework that fuses observed data with predictions for unobserved regions and uses a diffusion-based policy to output foresighted action sequences, reducing unnecessary movement and speeding up coverage in indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous exploration in indoor spaces struggles with modeling unobserved spaces and planning globally efficient paths; existing methods often miss reliable structural inferences or waste effort on uncertain predictions.

Method: Propose a region-evaluation global graph that combines observed information with predictions for unexplored areas, applying a region-level evaluator to emphasis reliable inferences while discounting uncertainty. On top, a diffusion policy network generates stable, foresighted action sequences with reduced denoising steps.

Result: In simulations and real-world deployments, GUIDE achieves up to 18.3% faster coverage completion and a 34.9% reduction in redundant movements compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GUIDE effectively combines global graph reasoning with diffusion-based planning to enhance autonomous indoor exploration, delivering faster coverage and more efficient trajectories while mitigating uncertainty in unobserved regions.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in structured and complex indoor environments remains
a challenging task, as existing methods often struggle to appropriately model
unobserved space and plan globally efficient paths. To address these
limitations, we propose GUIDE, a novel exploration framework that
synergistically combines global graph inference with diffusion-based
decision-making. We introduce a region-evaluation global graph representation
that integrates both observed environmental data and predictions of unexplored
areas, enhanced by a region-level evaluation mechanism to prioritize reliable
structural inferences while discounting uncertain predictions. Building upon
this enriched representation, a diffusion policy network generates stable,
foresighted action sequences with significantly reduced denoising steps.
Extensive simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GUIDE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 18.3% faster
coverage completion and a 34.9% reduction in redundant movements.

*Pinhao Song,Yurui Du,Ophelie Saussus,Sofie De Schrijver,Irene Caprara,Peter Janssen,Renaud Detry*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RT-V2 is a probabilistic shared-control navigation framework that predicts user intent and provides safe, efficient assistance by integrating a prior multimodal intent model with posterior updates from real-time input and context, validated across synthetic, HCI, and BMI experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve human-robot collaboration in navigation by robustly estimating user intent and safely assisting without overpowering user autonomy.

Method: Joint prior-posterior architecture: a prior capturing multimodal, history-dependent intent via recurrent neural networks and conditional variational autoencoders; a posterior update that fuses this prior with uncertain user commands and environmental context to infer desired actions. Integrates probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and safe optimization for shared control.

Result: RT-V2 outperforms state-of-the-art in intent estimation and provides safe, efficient navigation support while balancing autonomy and intervention. Demonstrated across synthetic benchmarks, keyboard-based HCI studies, and brain-machine interface experiments with non-human primates.

Conclusion: A principled, generalizable approach to shared control that unifies probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and safe optimization, with broad applicability to diverse assistive technologies.

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic shared-control solution for navigation, called
Robot Trajectron V2 (RT-V2), that enables accurate intent prediction and safe,
effective assistance in human-robot interaction. RT-V2 jointly models a user's
long-term behavioral patterns and their noisy, low-dimensional control signals
by combining a prior intent model with a posterior update that accounts for
real-time user input and environmental context. The prior captures the
multimodal and history-dependent nature of user intent using recurrent neural
networks and conditional variational autoencoders, while the posterior
integrates this with uncertain user commands to infer desired actions. We
conduct extensive experiments to validate RT-V2 across synthetic benchmarks,
human-computer interaction studies with keyboard input, and brain-machine
interface experiments with non-human primates. Results show that RT-V2
outperforms the state of the art in intent estimation, provides safe and
efficient navigation support, and adequately balances user autonomy with
assistive intervention. By unifying probabilistic modeling, reinforcement
learning, and safe optimization, RT-V2 offers a principled and generalizable
approach to shared control for diverse assistive technologies.

*Alexander Spiridonov,Jan-Nico Zaech,Nikolay Nikolov,Luc Van Gool,Danda Pani Paudel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unlabeled action-free videos of humans/robots can boost open-vocabulary generalist robot manipulation by learning a dense 3D dynamics predictor from hand/gripper point clouds and fine-tuning with limited action labels, enabling data-efficient, out-of-action learning in both real and simulated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action-labeled robot demonstrations are expensive and scale poorly; robust generalization in open-vocabulary settings hinges on large, high-quality labeled data. The work investigates whether unlabeled videos showing agents in action can provide signals to improve generalist policies while reducing labeling needs.

Method: Extract dense, dynamic 3D point clouds at the hand or gripper location from videos; train a 3D dynamics predictor via self-supervised learning; adapt/fine-tune this predictor into an action predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment; leverage unlabeled demonstrations (human and robot) to improve downstream policies and enable learning of new tasks without action labels (out-of-action generalization) in real-world and simulated environments.

Result: Demonstrates that learning from unlabeled demonstrations improves downstream generalist robot policies and enables learning new tasks without action labels in both real and simulated settings.

Conclusion: Unlabeled video data featuring action can meaningfully enhance generalist robot manipulation, supporting open-vocabulary performance and out-of-action generalization while reducing dependence on labeled demonstrations.

Abstract: Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle
diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling
high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods
rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method
that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or
robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling
data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D
point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics
predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action
predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that
our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations -
improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to
learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in
both real-world and simulated settings.

*Albina Klepach,Egor E. Nuzhin,Alexey A. Tsukanov,Nikolay V. Brilliantov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scalable leader-based control framework for large swarms that combines reinforcement learning with artificial forces within a generalized Vicsek model, demonstrated on evacuating crowds via a robot rescuer; outperforms naive RL and yields robust, efficient control; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling large collections of active agents (crowds, robotic swarms, transport) is hampered by scalability and robustness of per-agent control. A leader-based approach offers a scalable alternative.

Method: Develop a leader-controlled strategy by integrating reinforcement learning with artificial inter-agent forces using a generalized Vicsek model to guide agents; apply to evacuation with a robot rescuer (leader); compare against straightforward RL.

Result: Naive RL yields suboptimal results; the proposed leader-like RL with artificial forces provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy; source code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Leader-based control augmented with reinforcement learning and artificial forces in a generalized Vicsek framework is an effective scalable approach for steering large active-particle systems, with demonstrated success in evacuation scenarios and accessible code.

Abstract: Manipulation of large systems of active particles is a serious challenge
across diverse domains, including crowd management, control of robotic swarms,
and coordinated material transport. The development of advanced control
strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of
scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the
need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves
controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents
tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy
for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces
acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader
we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to
the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large
groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a
straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced
architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation
strategy. The source code supporting this study is publicly available at:

*Simon Schäfer,Bassam Alrifaee,Ehsan Hashemi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Lidar-based, CPU-edge roadside tracking framework enabling real-time object estimation with low compute, using EKF and simple priors; achieves 100 ms per message for 99.88% of data and is privacy-friendly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban sensing requires scalable, real-time tracking but traditional remote sensing is costly and computation-heavy, especially under degraded perceptual conditions; integrating sensing with existing infrastructure offers a scalable solution.

Method: A lidar-only pipeline running on CPU edge hardware with a GPU-free observer: state updates via Extended Kalman Filter; dimension estimation via 1D grid-map with Bayesian update; class estimation via a lookup table from the most probable footprint; existence probability from track age and bounding-box consistency; end-to-end real-time (<100 ms) with tests in dynamic urban-like scenes.

Result: Real-time performance: end-to-end pipeline completes within 100 ms for 99.88% of messages; high detection rate; robust to simulated wind and sensor vibrations; demonstrates feasibility of scalable, privacy-friendly roadside tracking on CPU-only hardware.

Conclusion: Lidar-only roadside tracking is feasible on commodity edge hardware, enabling scalable deployments integrated into urban infrastructure with reduced costs and simpler rollouts, while preserving privacy.

Abstract: This paper presents a lidar-only state estimation and tracking framework,
along with a roadside sensing unit for integration with existing urban
infrastructure. Urban deployments demand scalable, real-time tracking
solutions, yet traditional remote sensing remains costly and computationally
intensive, especially under perceptually degraded conditions. Our sensor node
couples a single lidar with an edge computing unit and runs a computationally
efficient, GPU-free observer that simultaneously estimates object state, class,
dimensions, and existence probability. The pipeline performs: (i) state updates
via an extended Kalman filter, (ii) dimension estimation using a 1D
grid-map/Bayesian update, (iii) class updates via a lookup table driven by the
most probable footprint, and (iv) existence estimation from track age and
bounding-box consistency. Experiments in dynamic urban-like scenes with diverse
traffic participants demonstrate real-time performance and high precision: The
complete end-to-end pipeline finishes within \SI{100}{\milli\second} for
\SI{99.88}{\%} of messages, with an excellent detection rate. Robustness is
further confirmed under simulated wind and sensor vibration. These results
indicate that reliable, real-time roadside tracking is feasible on CPU-only
edge hardware, enabling scalable, privacy-friendly deployments within existing
city infrastructure. The framework integrates with existing poles, traffic
lights, and buildings, reducing deployment costs and simplifying large-scale
urban rollouts and maintenance efforts.

*Yinzhao Dong,Ji Ma,Liu Zhao,Wanyue Li,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces MARG, a DRL controller for quadrupeds that fuses terrain maps with proprioception to safely traverse risky gap terrains; it trains with privileged information, employs a terrain map generation model (TMG) using a single LiDAR for zero-shot transfer, and demonstrates stability across challenging terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety and efficiency gaps in existing blind and perception-heavy locomotion controllers on risky gap terrains by combining terrain mapping, proprioception, and simulated privileged data to accelerate learning and improve real-world transfer.

Method: Proposes MARG DRL controller that dynamically uses terrain maps and proprioception; during training, selectively leverages privileged information (e.g., center of mass, friction coefficients) available in simulation; introduces three foot-related rewards to encourage safe footholds; introduces a terrain map generation (TMG) model to reduce mapping drift and provide accurate terrain maps from a single LiDAR; supports zero-shot transfer of the learned policy.

Result: Experimental results indicate MARG maintains stability across various risky terrain tasks, aided by TMG which reduces drift and supports zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: MARG advances quadrupedal locomotion by combining terrain maps with proprioception for safer, more robust traversal of risky terrains, reducing reliance on expensive perception systems and enabling zero-shot transfer in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers for quadrupedal locomotion have
demonstrated impressive performance on challenging terrains, allowing robots to
execute complex skills such as climbing, running, and jumping. However,
existing blind locomotion controllers often struggle to ensure safety and
efficient traversal through risky gap terrains, which are typically highly
complex, requiring robots to perceive terrain information and select
appropriate footholds during locomotion accurately. Meanwhile, existing
perception-based controllers still present several practical limitations,
including a complex multi-sensor deployment system and expensive computing
resource requirements. This paper proposes a DRL controller named MAstering
Risky Gap Terrains (MARG), which integrates terrain maps and proprioception to
dynamically adjust the action and enhance the robot's stability in these tasks.
During the training phase, our controller accelerates policy optimization by
selectively incorporating privileged information (e.g., center of mass,
friction coefficients) that are available in simulation but unmeasurable
directly in real-world deployments due to sensor limitations. We also designed
three foot-related rewards to encourage the robot to explore safe footholds.
More importantly, a terrain map generation (TMG) model is proposed to reduce
the drift existing in mapping and provide accurate terrain maps using only one
LiDAR, providing a foundation for zero-shot transfer of the learned policy. The
experimental results indicate that MARG maintains stability in various risky
terrain tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM Trainer converts a few demonstrations into a large robotic dataset for imitation learning using two-stage LLM-guided annotation and keypose retargeting, with Thompson sampling and an ensemble policy; demonstrated on a Franka Panda robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data collection burden in imitation learning by leveraging world knowledge of LLMs to generalize from few demonstrations across scenes.

Method: Two-stage process: offline annotation extracts keyframes, salient objects, and pose-object relations; online keypose retargeting adapts keyframes to a new scene using initial observation; warps keypoints to generate new trajectories; saves successful demos; Thompson sampling optimizes reusable annotation; ensemble policy combines LLM plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller.

Result: Annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines; improved generation success rate; hardware feasibility demonstrated on a Franka Emika Panda robot; project website provided for materials and videos.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable, reusable annotation across scenes for imitation learning, and the combination with a learned controller yields robust, feasible robotic demonstrations.

Abstract: We present LLM Trainer, a fully automated pipeline that leverages the world
knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform a small number of human
demonstrations (as few as one) into a large robot dataset for imitation
learning. Our approach decomposes demonstration generation into two steps: (1)
offline demonstration annotation that extracts keyframes, salient objects, and
pose-object relations; and (2) online keypose retargeting that adapts those
keyframes to a new scene, given an initial observation. Using these modified
keypoints, our system warps the original demonstration to generate a new
trajectory, which is then executed, and the resulting demo, if successful, is
saved. Because the annotation is reusable across scenes, we use Thompson
sampling to optimize the annotation, significantly improving generation success
rate. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, and find that our data
annotation method consistently outperforms expert-engineered baselines. We
further show an ensemble policy that combines the optimized LLM feed-forward
plan with a learned feedback imitation learning controller. Finally, we
demonstrate hardware feasibility on a Franka Emika Panda robot. For additional

TL;DR: A unified 3D scene representation (3D QSR) that combines panoptic 3D reconstruction, accurate point-cloud geometry, and scalable scene graphs, enabling semantic querying and object-level retrieval to guide robotic planning in 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need comprehensive scene understanding that fuses accurate geometry with human-interpretable semantics to translate high-level instructions into actions in complex 3D spaces.

Method: Proposes 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR) built on multimedia data, unifying three representations: (1) 3D-consistent view rendering/segmentation from panoptic reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, (3) structured scene graphs; object-centric design; integrates with large vision-language models (LLMs) to enable semantic queryability via multimodal object embeddings; supports object-level retrieval loaded into robotic task planner.

Result: Evaluated in Unity simulations with Replica dataset; applied to a digital wet-lab environment for emergency-response planning; results show improved scene understanding and integration of spatial and semantic reasoning, enabling translation of high-level instructions into precise robot plans.

Conclusion: 3D QSR offers a cohesive, scalable framework to unite geometry and semantics for robot planning, enabling semantic querying and retrieval that support complex task execution in 3D environments.

Abstract: To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform
complex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene
understanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a
meaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric
structure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we
introduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework
built on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:
(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic
reconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,
scalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,
the framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic
queryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting
object-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The
retrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream
execution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning
scenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the
indoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate
of a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for
emergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to
facilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,
effectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task
planning in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: A CPU-only TSDF-based volumetric mapping framework fuses LiDAR point clouds into a voxel grid with constant per-point-cloud processing time, enabling high-resolution real-time 3D reconstruction with accuracy comparable to GPU-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, real-time dense 3D mapping on commodity CPUs without GPU acceleration, by achieving constant runtime per point-cloud even as voxel grid resolution increases.

Method: Incremental fusion of raw LiDAR point clouds into a voxel grid using a directional bitmask-based integration scheme to produce a dense, consistent TSDF representation suitable for real-time reconstruction, operating entirely on CPU.

Result: Experiments on real-world open datasets show that the produced maps achieve accuracy on par with contemporary mapping techniques and that the CPU-based approach remains competitive in speed across varying resolutions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that CPU-only TSDF/ESDF-style volumetric mapping can achieve high-resolution, real-time 3D reconstruction with accuracy comparable to GPU-accelerated methods, broadening accessibility and reducing hardware requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a high-efficiency, CPU-only volumetric mapping framework
based on a Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). The system incrementally
fuses raw LiDAR point-cloud data into a voxel grid using a directional
bitmask-based integration scheme, producing dense and consistent TSDF
representations suitable for real-time 3D reconstruction. A key feature of the
approach is that the processing time per point-cloud remains constant,
regardless of the voxel grid resolution, enabling high resolution mapping
without sacrificing runtime performance. In contrast to most recent TSDF/ESDF
methods that rely on GPU acceleration, our method operates entirely on CPU,
achieving competitive results in speed. Experiments on real-world open datasets
demonstrate that the generated maps attain accuracy on par with contemporary
mapping techniques.

Motivation: Underactuated robotic systems must stabilize periodic orbits while synchronizing timing. Extending transverse linearization to include time-desynchronization enables joint stabilization and synchronization, bridging theory and practical distributed control.

Method: Extend the transverse linearization framework to incorporate time-desynchronization dynamics; stabilize the extended system via a combination of time-varying LQR and sliding-mode control; implement both centralized and decentralized controllers; validate experimentally on six Butterfly robots.

Result: Theoretical results are validated experimentally, demonstrating orbital stabilization with time synchronization under both centralized and decentralized control on a group of six Butterfly robots.

Conclusion: The paper presents a practical framework for joint orbital stabilization and time synchronization in underactuated systems, supported by experimental validation on real robots and showing viability of combining TV-LQR with sliding-mode control within an extended transverse-linearization approach.

Abstract: This paper presents a control methodology for achieving orbital stabilization
with simultaneous time synchronization of periodic trajectories in
underactuated robotic systems. The proposed approach extends the classical
transverse linearization framework to explicitly incorporate

The theoretical results are validated experimentally through the implementation
of both centralized and decentralized control strategies on a group of six
Butterfly robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discretized ESDF grids hinder precise gradients and fast local replanning; a continuous, differentiable distance field enables smooth trajectory optimization and safer operation in cluttered airspaces.

Method: Represent trajectories with fifth-order polynomials parameterized over a continuously updated neural ESDF; perform a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline; allow adjustable local window sizes and optimization parameters to balance efficiency, safety, and smoothness; rely on continuous gradient information along the trajectory.

Result: Demonstrates collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories; flexible parameterization enables adaptation to diverse user needs without sacrificing performance; shows robustness and generalizability for local replanning in aerial robotics.

Conclusion: C-3TO provides a robust and generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial robotics by integrating continuous trajectory parameterization with a continuously updated neural ESDF.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for continuous 3D trajectory
optimization in cluttered environments, leveraging online neural Euclidean
Signed Distance Fields (ESDFs). Unlike prior approaches that rely on
discretized ESDF grids with interpolation, our method directly optimizes smooth
trajectories represented by fifth-order polynomials over a continuous neural
ESDF, ensuring precise gradient information throughout the entire trajectory.
The framework integrates a two-stage nonlinear optimization pipeline that
balances efficiency, safety and smoothness. Experimental results demonstrate
that C-3TO produces collision-aware and dynamically feasible trajectories.
Moreover, its flexibility in defining local window sizes and optimization
parameters enables straightforward adaptation to diverse user's needs without
compromising performance. By combining continuous trajectory parameterization
with a continuously updated neural ESDF, C-3TO establishes a robust and
generalizable foundation for safe and efficient local replanning in aerial
robotics.

*Venkat Margapuri,Garik Kazanjian,Naren Kosaraju*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid safety verification framework for closed-loop multi-agent systems under bounded disturbances uses a psi-weighted control barrier function to encode directional control alignment, combining deterministic admissibility with Monte Carlo validation and PAC-style probabilistic safety guarantees; experiments under stochastic disturbances validate feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety verification for interconnected multi-agent systems operating under stochastic disturbances; limitations of purely deterministic or purely empirical methods necessitate a framework combining both for probabilistic safety certificates.

Method: Introduce a psi-weighted formulation that augments control barrier functions to encode directional alignment between agents. The framework couples deterministic admissibility with empirical Monte Carlo rollouts and derives a PAC-style bound based on margin-aware safety violations to produce a probabilistic safety certificate.

Result: Experiments with bounded stochastic disturbances demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining safety under uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical hybrid approach that combines formal safety constraints with data-driven validation to obtain probabilistic safety guarantees for closed-loop multi-agent systems under bounded disturbances.

Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid safety verification framework for closed-loop
multi-agent systems under bounded stochastic disturbances. The proposed
approach augments control barrier functions with a novel $\psi$-weighted
formulation that encodes directional control alignment between agents into the
safety constraints. Deterministic admissibility is combined with empirical
validation via Monte Carlo rollouts, and a PAC-style guarantee is derived based
on margin-aware safety violations to provide a probabilistic safety
certificate. The results from the experiments conducted under different bounded
stochastic disturbances validate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

*Pengxiang Li,Yinan Zheng,Yue Wang,Huimin Wang,Hang Zhao,Jingjing Liu,Xianyuan Zhan,Kun Zhan,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based safety-aware planning framework for autonomous driving (ReflectDrive) that discretizes action space, fine-tunes diffusion language models, and uses a gradient-free reflection loop with inpainting to generate safe trajectories, outperforming baselines on NAVSIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning in end-to-end autonomous driving struggles to encode physical rules during training and relies on heavy post-refinement, reinforcement learning, or expensive diffusion guidance; there is a need for scalable, safety-conscious planning methods.

Method: Discretize 2D driving space into an action codebook to enable planning with pre-trained Diffusion Language Models through fine-tuning; introduce a safety-aware reflection mechanism that iteratively self-corrects without gradients; start with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to capture multi-modal driving; apply local search to identify unsafe tokens and establish feasible solutions; use inpainting-based regeneration anchored by safe tokens.

Result: On NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive achieves significant improvements in safety-critical trajectory generation, demonstrating scalability and reliability for autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: ReflectDrive integrates discrete diffusion-based planning with a gradient-free safety-correction loop and inpainting-based regeneration, offering a practical and safer end-to-end driving solution.

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.

*Sicong Liu,Jianhui Liu,Fang Chen,Wenjian Yang,Juan Yi,Yu Zheng,Zheng Wang,Wanchao Chi,Chaoyang Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A biomimetic vertebraic soft robotic tail (BVSR) combines a compliant pneumatic body with a passively jointed vertebral column to achieve high-speed actuation and strong inertial dynamics while maintaining safety, outperforming non-vertebraic designs by over 200%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between rigid tails (large inertial effects) and soft tails (limited speed/force) by decoupling load-bearing from actuation via a vertebral, compliant, hybrid design.

Method: Design and implement BVSR: a compliant pneumatic body reinforced by a passively jointed vertebral column; develop a kinematic/dynamic model with vertebral constraints; experimental validation including actuation up to 6 bar; measurement of angular velocity (>670 deg/s) and inertial forces/torques (5.58 N, 1.21 Nm).

Result: Model validated experimentally; BVSR achieves high-speed, strong inertial responses; >200% improvement over non-vertebraic designs; demonstrations include rapid cart stabilization, obstacle negotiation, high-speed steering, and integration with a quadruped platform.

Conclusion: The BVSR tail effectively balances compliance and dynamics, enabling agile, versatile robotic platforms and offering practical utility for navigation and manipulation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Robotic tails can enhance the stability and maneuverability of mobile robots,
but current designs face a trade-off between the power of rigid systems and the
safety of soft ones. Rigid tails generate large inertial effects but pose risks
in unstructured environments, while soft tails lack sufficient speed and force.
We present a Biomimetic Vertebraic Soft Robotic (BVSR) tail that resolves this
challenge through a compliant pneumatic body reinforced by a passively jointed
vertebral column inspired by musculoskeletal structures. This hybrid design
decouples load-bearing and actuation, enabling high-pressure actuation (up to 6
bar) for superior dynamics while preserving compliance. A dedicated kinematic
and dynamic model incorporating vertebral constraints is developed and
validated experimentally. The BVSR tail achieves angular velocities above
670{\deg}/s and generates inertial forces and torques up to 5.58 N and 1.21 Nm,
indicating over 200% improvement compared to non-vertebraic designs.
Demonstrations on rapid cart stabilization, obstacle negotiation, high-speed
steering, and quadruped integration confirm its versatility and practical
utility for agile robotic platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First techno-economic roadmap benchmarking MoCap, UWB, and ceiling-mounted camera networks for localisation, asset tracking, and surface defect detection in a GPS-denied hangar, plus a dual-layer optimization to minimize hardware while meeting accuracy targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPS-denied aircraft hangars with tall ceilings and multipath create a gap in domain-specific guidance. There is a need for comparative, cost‑accurate, and integrable localization studies to enable scalable Smart Hangar deployments.

Method: Benchmark three sensing modalities (MoCap, UWB, ceiling cameras) across three operational scenarios in a 40×50 m hangar. Develop a dual-layer optimization: (1) market-based camera-lens selection, (2) an optimization solver to position cameras to meet accuracy while minimizing hardware.

Result: A framework and roadmap that identify the cost-accuracy-coverage tradeoffs and demonstrate that an optimized vision architecture can achieve robust, cost-effective sensing in Smart Hangars, with actionable guidance for planners on balancing accuracy, coverage, and budget.

Conclusion: Provides the first techno-economic roadmap for Smart Hangars, enabling reliable deployment of localisation systems by integrating performance and cost considerations for MoCap, UWB, and ceiling-camera networks.

Abstract: The accuracy, resilience, and affordability of localisation are fundamental
to autonomous robotic inspection within aircraft maintenance and overhaul (MRO)
hangars. Hangars typically feature tall ceilings and are often made of
materials such as metal. Due to its nature, it is considered a GPS-denied
environment, with extensive multipath effects and stringent operational
constraints that collectively create a uniquely challenging environment. This
persistent gap highlights the need for domain-specific comparative studies,
including rigorous cost, accuracy, and integration assessments, to inform a
reliable and scalable deployment of a localisation system in the Smart Hangar.
This paper presents the first techno-economic roadmap that benchmarks motion
capture (MoCap), ultra-wideband (UWB), and a ceiling-mounted camera network
across three operational scenarios: robot localisation, asset tracking, and
surface defect detection within a 40x50 m hangar bay. A dual-layer optimisation
for camera selection and positioning framework is introduced, which couples
market-based camera-lens selection with an optimisation solver, producing
camera layouts that minimise hardware while meeting accuracy targets. The
roadmap equips MRO planners with an actionable method to balance accuracy,
coverage, and budget, demonstrating that an optimised vision architecture has
the potential to unlock robust and cost-effective sensing for next-generation
Smart Hangars.

### [125] [AnchDrive: Bootstrapping Diffusion Policies with Hybrid Trajectory Anchors for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20253)
*Jinhao Chai,Anqing Jiang,Hao Jiang,Shiyi Mu,Zichong Gu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AnchorDrive introduces an anchor-based diffusion planner for end-to-end autonomous driving, bootstrapping with a rich set of trajectory anchors to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality plans, achieving state-of-the-art results on NAVSIM with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end planners face behavioral multi-modality and poor generalization in long-tail scenarios, while diffusion models are computationally expensive. An anchor-based bootstrapping approach can reduce compute while preserving diversity and accuracy.

Method: Construct planners that initialize from static priors and dynamic, context-aware trajectory anchors. Use a Transformer to decode dynamic anchors from dense and sparse perceptual features. A diffusion model refines anchors by predicting a distribution of trajectory offsets for fine-grained refinement, enabling end-to-end training.

Result: NAVSIM experiments show AnchDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: Anchor-based bootstrapping enables efficient generation of diverse, high-quality trajectories for end-to-end driving, reducing computational cost while sustaining or improving performance.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-modal planning has become a transformative paradigm in
autonomous driving, effectively addressing behavioral multi-modality and the
generalization challenge in long-tail scenarios. We propose AnchDrive, a
framework for end-to-end driving that effectively bootstraps a diffusion policy
to mitigate the high computational cost of traditional generative models.
Rather than denoising from pure noise, AnchDrive initializes its planner with a
rich set of hybrid trajectory anchors. These anchors are derived from two
complementary sources: a static vocabulary of general driving priors and a set
of dynamic, context-aware trajectories. The dynamic trajectories are decoded in
real-time by a Transformer that processes dense and sparse perceptual features.
The diffusion model then learns to refine these anchors by predicting a
distribution of trajectory offsets, enabling fine-grained refinement. This
anchor-based bootstrapping design allows for efficient generation of diverse,
high-quality trajectories. Experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark confirm that
AnchDrive sets a new state-of-the-art and shows strong gen?eralizability

### [126] [HL-IK: A Lightweight Implementation of Human-Like Inverse Kinematics in Humanoid Arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20263)
*Bingjie Chen,Zihan Wang,Zhe Han,Guoping Pan,Yi Cheng,Houde Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight HL-IK framework that preserves end-effector accuracy while shaping whole-arm configurations to be human-like, via a FiLM-modulated spatio-temporal elbow prior (FiSTA) learned from motion data and integrated as a small residual in a Levenberg–Marquardt IK solver; demonstrated as a drop-in, with simulation and hardware validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IK for redundant humanoids focuses on EE tracking and often yields mechanically valid but non-human-like poses; HL-IK aims to achieve anthropomorphic arm configurations without full-body sensing at runtime.

Method: Train FiSTA on retargeted large-scale human motion data to predict the next-step elbow pose from the EE target and a short history of EE-elbow states. Use this prediction as a residual added to the LM objective alongside EE tracking and smoothing terms, making HL-IK a drop-in for numerical IK stacks.

Result: In 183k simulation steps, arm-similarity position error reduced by 30.6% and direction error by 35.4% on average; on the most challenging trajectories, reductions of 42.2% and 47.4%. Hardware teleoperation confirmed anthropomorphic gains.

Conclusion: HL-IK is simple to integrate, adaptable across platforms via the provided pipeline, and incurs minimal computation, enabling human-like motions for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Traditional IK methods for redundant humanoid manipulators emphasize
end-effector (EE) tracking, frequently producing configurations that are valid
mechanically but not human-like. We present Human-Like Inverse Kinematics
(HL-IK), a lightweight IK framework that preserves EE tracking while shaping
whole-arm configurations to appear human-like, without full-body sensing at
runtime. The key idea is a learned elbow prior: using large-scale human motion
data retargeted to the robot, we train a FiLM-modulated spatio-temporal
attention network (FiSTA) to predict the next-step elbow pose from the EE
target and a short history of EE-elbow states.This prediction is incorporated
as a small residual alongside EE and smoothness terms in a standard
Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer, making HL-IK a drop-in addition to numerical IK
stacks. Over 183k simulation steps, HL-IK reduces arm-similarity position and
direction error by 30.6% and 35.4% on average, and by 42.2% and 47.4% on the
most challenging trajectories. Hardware teleoperation on a robot distinct from
simulation further confirms the gains in anthropomorphism. HL-IK is simple to
integrate, adaptable across platforms via our pipeline, and adds minimal
computation, enabling human-like motions for humanoid robots. Project page:

*Georgios Tziafas,Jiayun Zhang,Hamidreza Kasaei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PAD enables generalizable one-shot bimanual policies from a single human video by parsing it into keypoint-action trajectories, simulator-free augmentation via task-and-motion planning, and distillation into a keypoint-conditioned policy, outperforming sim-based image-policy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data collection burden and improve generalization for visuomotor policies, while mitigating sim-to-real gap by avoiding synthetic image data and simulators; leverage robust keypoint representations for better category-level generalization.

Method: Three-step PAD: (a) parse a human video demo into a robot-executable keypoint-action trajectory, (b) augment the demonstration at scale using bimanual task-and-motion planning without simulators, (c) distill augmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy.

Result: PAD outperforms state-of-the-art bimanual demonstration augmentation methods that rely on image policies with simulation rollouts, in success rate and sample/cost efficiency; demonstrates one-shot policies that generalize to unseen spatial arrangements, object instances, and background distractors across six real-world tasks (e.g., pouring, cleaning, opening containers).

Conclusion: PAD provides a unified framework to learn generalizable bimanual policies from a single demonstration by coupling parsing, simulator-free augmentation, and distillation into a keypoint-conditioned policy, addressing data efficiency and generalization without simulators.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies from expert demonstrations is an important
frontier in modern robotics research, however, most popular methods require
copious efforts for collecting teleoperation data and struggle to generalize
out-ofdistribution. Scaling data collection has been explored through
leveraging human videos, as well as demonstration augmentation techniques. The
latter approach typically requires expensive simulation rollouts and trains
policies with synthetic image data, therefore introducing a sim-to-real gap. In
parallel, alternative state representations such as keypoints have shown great
promise for category-level generalization. In this work, we bring these avenues
together in a unified framework: PAD (Parse-AugmentDistill), for learning
generalizable bimanual policies from a single human video. Our method relies on
three steps: (a) parsing a human video demo into a robot-executable
keypoint-action trajectory, (b) employing bimanual task-and-motion-planning to
augment the demonstration at scale without simulators, and (c) distilling the
augmented trajectories into a keypoint-conditioned policy. Empirically, we
showcase that PAD outperforms state-ofthe-art bimanual demonstration
augmentation works relying on image policies with simulation rollouts, both in
terms of success rate and sample/cost efficiency. We deploy our framework in
six diverse real-world bimanual tasks such as pouring drinks, cleaning trash
and opening containers, producing one-shot policies that generalize in unseen
spatial arrangements, object instances and background distractors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation often requires objects entering/exiting the camera view; current end-to-end policies lack explicit spatial memory to track scene state over time.

Method: Introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies). Develop a 3D diffusion policy that conditions robot trajectories on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the scene encoded in deep feature maps, enabling memory of spatial layout during planning and control; end-to-end training; release reconstruction, training code, and evaluation tasks.

Result: Simulation experiments show the approach solves tasks where memory-less state-of-the-art methods struggle; claims improved performance and robustness; code and data released.

Conclusion: Memory-augmented diffusion-based policies leveraging 3D semantic reconstructions can enhance manipulation when objects pass in and out of view; the work provides a practical pipeline and resources to advance research in spatial memory for robotics.

Abstract: End-to-end learning of robot control policies, structured as neural networks,
has emerged as a promising approach to robotic manipulation. To complete many
common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's
field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the
spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However,
building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research
problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D
Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based
on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation
experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where
state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle. We release our
reconstruction system, training code, and evaluation tasks to spur research in
this direction.

Motivation: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires tight integration of perception and control. Existing approaches rely on external motion capture or fail to generalize across diverse tasks, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input.

Conclusion: VisualMimic shows that unifying egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control through a learned low-level keypoint tracker and a high-level policy enables robust sim-to-real transfer for humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments, extending to outdoor scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to

*Yifu Luo,Yongzhe Chang,Xueqian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based offline RL method (WFDiffuser) uses wavelet decomposition and FFT-based features with cross-attention to address frequency-domain shifts, yielding smoother trajectories and better performance on D4RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-domain-only diffusion models in offline RL introduce low-frequency shifts in the spectrum, causing trajectory instability and degraded performance; leveraging frequency-domain representations aims to stabilize learning.

Method: Propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser) that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform to split trajectories into low/high frequency components, applies Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross-attention to model and interact frequency features for diffusion.

Result: Empirical results on D4RL show reduced frequency shift, smoother trajectories, and improved decision-making performance compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency-domain analysis via wavelet and FFT within diffusion models improves offline RL stability and performance; cross-frequency interaction is key.

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

TL;DR: Deep learning on transaction networks (GCN) with centrality features improves AML detection, reducing false positives and enabling detection of complex schemes, potentially replacing or complementing rule-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AML systems suffer from high false positive rates and limited ability to uncover sophisticated money-laundering schemes; there is a need for models that leverage the network structure of financial transactions.

Method: Apply graph-based deep learning (GCN) on financial transaction graphs and augment with centrality metrics (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, PageRank) to capture influence and connectivity within the network.

Result: The approach demonstrates practicality and superiority over traditional implementations, showing that DL with network centrality enhances detection in connectivity-structured financial data.

Conclusion: Integrating deep learning with centrality-aware network analysis can enhance AML effectiveness, suggesting a promising direction for future AML systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepACTIF is a lightweight, architecture-aware feature attribution method for LSTMs that uses inverse-weighted activation aggregation to provide fast, robust explanations with strong performance even when using only top features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time interpretability for time-series models in domains like healthcare, biometrics, and AR/edge computing; standard attribution methods are too slow and resource-intensive for edge devices.

Method: Inverse-weighted aggregation of internal LSTM activations, leveraging architecture-aware signals to estimate feature importance with emphasis on stability and magnitude across time steps, enabling efficient, real-time attribution.

Result: Outperforms SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT in accuracy and robustness; maintains predictive performance when using only the top 10% features; reduces computation time and memory by orders of magnitude; robust across three biometric gaze datasets; statistical analyses (Wilcoxon tests and effect sizes) show more informative rankings with lower error across top-k (10–40%).

Conclusion: DeepACTIF enables real-time interpretability on edge devices without sacrificing accuracy when using a compact feature subset, making it suitable for mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors.

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

### [134] [Analyzing the Impact of Credit Card Fraud on Economic Fluctuations of American Households Using an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19363)
*Zhuqi Wang,Qinghe Zhang,Zhuopei Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid Enhanced ANFIS using wavelet decomposition and temporal attention for credit card fraud detection; shows RMSE improvement over local neuro-fuzzy and LSTM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit card fraud threatens household finances and causes unpredictable changes in economic behavior. Classical ANFIS has fixed input-output relations and may miss temporal dependencies and localized shocks. The paper aims to address these gaps by integrating wavelet-based feature extraction and temporal attention within an adaptive fuzzy framework.

Method: An enhanced ANFIS framework that uses discrete wavelet transforms on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized shock signals, feeding these into a deep fuzzy rule library based on Takagi-Sugeno rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. Introduces a temporal attention encoder that assigns weights to multi-scale economic patterns, coupling fuzzy rule activation with wavelet basis selection and temporal weights through modular training.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows an RMSE reduction of 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.

Conclusion: The method extends ANFIS by jointly optimizing wavelet-based feature extraction, fuzzy rule activation, and temporal weighting, enabling improved capture of long-term temporal dependencies and fraudulent anomalies; demonstrates the potential of hybrid neuro-fuzzy–wavelet–attention architectures for fraud detection.

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

Motivation: Growing need for scalable, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets where traditional audits struggle.

Method: Preprocess data; implement four unsupervised detectors; evaluate via precision, recall, F1; compare single-model vs hybrid approaches; case study on federal spending.

Result: Hybrid approach outperforms individual detectors in accuracy and robustness; demonstrates potential of unsupervised methods for improving audit efficiency.

Conclusion: Unsupervised learning can enhance audit quality and oversight; implications for auditors and policymakers; supports adoption of ensemble anomaly detection in government financial data.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection
methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and
compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based
Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum
Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify
anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need
for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental
datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology
involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid
approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and
accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the
comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating
the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality
and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and
researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial
oversight and risk management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOTA hallucination detection is largely driven by data leakage; when controlled, it does not beat linear probes; it requires heavy tuning and fails out-of-distribution generalization; the authors propose evaluation guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the reliability and generalization of current state-of-the-art methods for detecting model hallucinations and their evaluation.

Method: Empirical evaluation on the RAGTruth dataset with controls for spurious data correlations; compare SOTA approaches to supervised linear probes; examine hyperparameter sensitivity and cross-dataset performance; assess out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: SOTA performance is largely due to spurious data correlations; after accounting for this, performance is no better than simple linear probes; it demands extensive hyperparameter tuning; OOD generalization is poor, near random.

Conclusion: Propose guidelines for hallucination detection and its evaluation to promote robust, generalizable assessment and to mitigate data leakage and evaluation protocol pitfalls.

Abstract: We critically assess the efficacy of the current SOTA in hallucination
detection and find that its performance on the RAGTruth dataset is largely
driven by a spurious correlation with data. Controlling for this effect,
state-of-the-art performs no better than supervised linear probes, while
requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Out-of-distribution
generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods
performing close to random. We propose a set of guidelines for hallucination
detection and its evaluation.

TL;DR: ABC treats LLMs as stochastic simulators to infer posterior predictive probabilities, improving accuracy and calibration in clinical diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty expression in LLMs is insufficient for high-stakes use; standard baselines produce overconfident, poorly calibrated estimates.

Method: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference approach, treats LLMs as stochastic simulators to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities. Evaluated on two clinical benchmarks (synthetic oral lesion diagnoses and GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis).

Result: Accuracy improvements up to 46.9%, Brier scores reduced by 74.4%, and calibration improvements measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Conclusion: ABC provides improved uncertainty quantification for LLM-based predictions in clinical diagnostics, enabling safer deployment and potentially generalizing to other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

*Matthew Grofsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recency-based priors beat simple heuristics for freshness tasks in RAG on cybersecurity data; a clustering heuristic for topic evolution performed poorly, indicating trend detection requires more than basic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems when processing cybersecurity data; assess whether simple recency priors or clustering can capture freshness and topic evolution over time.

Method: Two approaches were evaluated on cybersecurity data: (1) a simple recency prior to optimize freshness detection, and (2) a clustering heuristic to model topic evolution over time.

Result: Freshness task accuracy of 1.00 achieved with the recency prior; topic-evolution detection with the clustering heuristic yielded an F1-score of 0.08.

Conclusion: Simple heuristics can suffice for freshness emphasis in RAG, but detecting topic evolution trends requires more sophisticated methods beyond basic clustering or heuristic approaches.

Abstract: We address temporal failures in RAG systems using two methods on
cybersecurity data. A simple recency prior achieved an accuracy of 1.00 on
freshness tasks. In contrast, a clustering heuristic for topic evolution failed
(0.08 F1-score), showing trend detection requires methods beyond simple
heuristics.

### [139] [Learning from Observation: A Survey of Recent Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19379)
*Returaj Burnwal,Hriday Mehta,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a framework for Learning from Observation (state-only imitation learning), surveys existing LfO methods by trajectory construction and design choices, links LfO with offline/model-based/hierarchical RL, and outlines open problems and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often requires action labels from expert demonstrations, which can be impractical to obtain in real-world settings. Learning from observation enables imitation using only expert state data, broadening applicability.

Method: Propose a general framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of trajectory construction, assumptions, and algorithmic design choices; discuss connections to offline RL, model-based RL, and hierarchical RL.

Result: A unifying framework and taxonomy for LfO; a survey of existing LfO methods; insights into how trajectory construction and design choices affect performance; mapping to related RL fields; identification of open problems.

Conclusion: LfO is a promising direction to enable imitation without actions; the framework provides a structured way to compare methods and guide future research; several open problems remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

*Axel Marmoret,Reda Bensaid,Jonathan Lys,Vincent Gripon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensLoRA provides a unified tensor-based extension of LoRA for Transformers, generalizing prior tensor approaches and enabling mode-specific compression to tailor parameter budgets, with empirical gains on vision and language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's independent, per-projection adapters limit joint modeling across queries, keys, values and layers; a systematic tensor-based framework is lacking, restricting flexible parameter budgeting across modalities.

Method: Aggregate LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, define a general, multi-mode low-rank adaptation that subsumes existing tensor-based methods; allow mode-specific ranks/compression; apply to vision and language transformers; compare with standard LoRA under equal parameter budgets.

Result: Tensor construction choices significantly impact performance; TensLoRA can surpass standard LoRA at similar parameter counts in some cases; demonstrates cross-modal effectiveness.

Conclusion: TensLoRA is a unifying framework that generalizes tensor-based LoRA, offering flexible, mode-specific compression and potential performance benefits; prompts systematic exploration of tensor structures for adaptation.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniFed is a modular Federated Learning framework that decouples configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic, enabling topology flexibility, mixed protocols, and pluggable privacy/compression modules for deployment across heterogeneous environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning in edge/HPC contexts requires privacy-preserving, configurable, and extensible systems that can adapt to diverse topologies and protocols without compromising core integrity.

Method: A modular architecture with extension points that decouple concerns (config, orchestration, learning logic, privacy/compression), supports topology/configuration-driven prototyping, code-level override, multiple training algorithms, mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and optional privacy mechanisms (DP, HE, SA) and compression; exposes plugins to customize topology, orchestration, learning logic, and privacy/compression.

Result: Evaluates multiple models and algorithms to measure various performance metrics, demonstrating that the unified stack can streamline FL deployment across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: OmniFed unifies topology configuration, mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules into one stack, enabling configurable, extensible, and privacy-conscious FL deployment, with a public GitHub repository for implementation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing
(HPC) where data is not centralized and privacy is crucial. We present OmniFed,
a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its
architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level
override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies,
mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training
algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential
Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed
streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments. Github repository

### [142] [TimeMosaic: Temporal Heterogeneity Guided Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Granularity Patch and Segment-wise Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19406)
*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Chunyi Hou,Zheya Wang,Lei Wang,Zhengxin Yang,Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeMosaic introduces adaptive patch embedding and horizon-aware (segment-wise) decoding to address temporal heterogeneity in multivariate forecasting, achieving consistent improvements over fixed-length patch methods and competitive results with state-of-the-art TSFMs when trained on large-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing patch-based forecasting often uses fixed-length segments, which fail to capture heterogeneous local temporal dynamics and horizon-specific information needs. This leads to loss of details in dense regions, redundancy in stable segments, and poor handling of short- vs long-term horizons.

Method: Adaptive patch embedding dynamically adjusts segmentation granularity based on local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while maintaining temporal continuity. Segment-wise decoding treats each forecast horizon as a related subtask and uses horizon-specific decoders to handle varying difficulty and information requirements, instead of a single uniform decoder. Large-scale pretraining on a corpus with 321 billion observations is reported to attain competitive performance.

Result: TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods on benchmark datasets and, when trained on the 321-billion-observation corpus, achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Conclusion: The approach addresses both temporal heterogeneity and decoding heterogeneity in multivariate time series forecasting, demonstrating robustness, scalability, and strong empirical performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

*Obu-Amoah Ampomah,Edmund Agyemang,Kofi Acheampong,Louis Agyekum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative study of resampling methods (SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, ADASYN) for credit default prediction, evaluating multiple classifiers with and without resampling; Boruta feature selection + DBSCAN outlier detection + SMOTE-Tomek + GBM yields the best performance on a real Cleveland dataset (F1 82.56%, G-mean 82.98%, ROC-AUC 90.90%, PR-AUC 91.85%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit default datasets are highly imbalanced; establishing baseline performance on unbalanced data and evaluating resampling and modeling pipelines to improve predictive accuracy and robustness for credit risk scoring.

Method: Experiments on the Cleveland ML Repository credit default dataset using Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost, AdaBoost, GBM, and LightGBM; apply Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection; compare baseline (no resampling) vs. resampling with SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN; evaluate with ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, G-mean, and F1; identify best pipeline: Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM.

Result: Best performing pipeline achieved F1 82.56%, G-mean 82.98%, ROC-AUC 90.90%, PR-AUC 91.85%.

Conclusion: The study shows that integrating feature selection (Boruta), outlier detection (DBSCAN), and a SMOTE-Tomek resampling step with GBM yields superior credit default prediction, providing a foundation for more resilient credit risk systems as data volumes grow.

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

### [144] [Analyzing Uncertainty Quantification in Statistical and Deep Learning Models for Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19417)
*Andreas Lebedev,Abhinav Das,Sven Pappert,Stephan Schlüter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ensemble DDNNs and traditional LEAR-based models are evaluated for probabilistic forecasting of German electricity prices; model uncertainty via conformal prediction and MC dropout, ensemble, QRA and GARCH; results show LEAR-based models perform well across probabilistic metrics, DDNNs benefit from combining data and model uncertainty, and conformal prediction best captures uncertainty; overall, model performance is metric-dependent and competitive across approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in probabilistic electricity price forecasting is essential for risk management. Many models fail to capture full uncertainty coming from data, model choices, and distributional assumptions. The study aims to compare state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic models on German market data, focusing on how different UQ techniques affect forecast quality.

Method: Evaluate deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) augmented with ensemble methods, Monte Carlo dropout, and conformal prediction to capture model uncertainty. Also evaluate LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) models with quantile regression averaging (QRA), GARCH, and conformal prediction. Use German electricity price data (likely EPEX) and assess across multiple point and probabilistic forecasting metrics.

Result: LEAR-based models consistently show strong probabilistic performance across metrics, irrespective of the UQ technique used. DDNNs improve both point and probabilistic forecasts when uncertainty (data and model) is incorporated, with conformal prediction effectively capturing uncertainty. Overall, all models are competitive; performance is heavily metric-dependent, and no single approach dominates.

Conclusion: There is no one-size-fits-all model for probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Depending on the chosen evaluation metrics, different models excel. For robust UQ, conformal prediction appears particularly effective, and combining data and model uncertainty (as in DDNNs) yields benefits. Practitioners should consider multiple models and UQ strategies tailored to their metric priorities.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

*Birk Torpmann-Hagen,Pål Halvorsen,Michael A. Riegler,Dag Johansen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a runtime, risk-aware verification and evaluation framework for deep neural networks under distributional shifts. It models shift incidence using OOD detector outputs and combines these with conditional network correctness in a binary tree to yield accurate accuracy estimates and enable cost-aware risk assessment; validated on multiple datasets with low error (roughly 0.01–0.1) and demonstrated on a medical segmentation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark performance of deep nets often fails in real-world deployment due to distributional shifts. Existing evaluations rarely account for shifts, causing inflated metrics and unsafe deployment. The work aims to close the gap by providing a principled verification, evaluation, and risk assessment framework that handles runtime shifts.

Method: Estimate the probability of distributional shifts at runtime from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. Combine these shift probabilities with conditional probabilities of the network being correct to build a binary tree. Traverse the tree to calculate credible, precise estimates of network accuracy. Evaluate on five datasets under simulated deployment conditions with varying shift frequencies. Extend the framework to risk assessment in a medical segmentation benchmark by assigning costs to tree nodes to inform cost-benefit analyses.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, achieving accuracy estimation errors typically in the range of 0.01 to 0.1. It also demonstrates practical risk assessment potential in a medical segmentation task by enabling cost-informed decisions.

Conclusion: A robust framework for improving reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems in safety-critical settings, delivering more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments by explicitly modeling distributional shifts at deployment time.

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

TL;DR: Unified CFTL benchmarking with leakage-free pretraining on proprietary/synthetic data; statistical models and ensembles outperform FFMs across large datasets; synthetic pretraining provides a notable but smaller boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CFTL benchmarking is flawed due to small evaluation datasets, improper statistics, and leakage risk between pretraining and test data.

Method: Reimplement widely-used neural forecasting networks for CFTL, pretrain on proprietary and synthetic data with leakage prevention, and evaluate on 15 large public forecast competition datasets.

Result: Statistical models and their ensembles outperform existing FFMs by >8.2% in sCRPS and >20% in MASE across datasets; synthetic data pretraining improves FFM accuracy by ~7%.

Conclusion: A leakage-free, unified benchmarking framework reveals stronger performance for statistical models and the potential of synthetic pretraining, highlighting underreported statistics and the need for robust evaluation practices.

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces THINNs, a thermodynamically consistent PINN variant for non-equilibrium fluctuations by using a large-deviations-based penalty that targets improbable deviations, with theory and experiments validating it against standard penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align PINN penalization with the underlying fluctuation structure of non-equilibrium systems and ensure thermodynamic consistency by leveraging large-deviations principles.

Method: Formulates a penalty term grounded in large deviations to penalize rare deviations, yielding THINNs. Provides analytical a posteriori error estimates and compares empirically to existing penalization strategies.

Result: Analytical a posteriori estimates are established for THINNs; empirical comparisons show advantages over conventional penalties, demonstrating thermodynamic consistency and improved handling of fluctuations.

Conclusion: THINNs offer a thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs that integrates fluctuation theory via large-deviations-based penalties, supported by theory and empirical validation.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

### [148] [Transformer Modeling for Both Scalability and Performance in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19471)
*Hunjae Lee,Corey Clark*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTAformer introduces delegate tokens to constrain inter-variable mixing in multivariate time-series transformers, enabling linear scaling with variable count and improving performance and noise resilience over standard quadratic transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability bottlenecks in multivariate time-series transformers arise from high variable counts and indiscriminate inter-variable mixing, which can inject noise and misalign heterogeneous signals. There is a need to decouple inter-variable interactions from temporal modeling while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: Introduce delegate tokens to regulate inter-variable information flow. Inter-variable modeling is constrained via these tokens, while full inter-temporal modeling remains unconstrained. The delegate tokens act as a regularizer, promoting selective propagation of inter-variable information, yielding linear scalability with the number of variables.

Result: Empirical evaluations show DELTAformer scales linearly with the number of variables and achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines, outperforming standard transformers. It also demonstrates superior noise resilience, focusing on relevant signals more effectively in noisy MTS environments.

Conclusion: By tailoring the model design to core MTS challenges, DELTAformer achieves linear scalability without sacrificing, and often improving, performance compared to traditional quadratic transformers, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, high-performance MTS modeling.

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

*Trung Nguyen Thanh,Huyen Giang Thi Thu,Tai Le Quy,Ha-Bang Ban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refined MILP formulation for counterfactual explanations reduces LOF-related constraints, yielding faster solutions without sacrificing explanation quality, demonstrated on a linear SVM with standard scaler.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plausible counterfactual explanations improve realism but current optimization models add many constraints, causing high computational cost; improving efficiency is needed.

Method: Revisit the DACE framework and introduce a refined MILP formulation that significantly reduces LOF objective constraints; apply it to a linear SVM with standard scaling.

Result: Faster solving times while maintaining explanation quality.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of more efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanations and broader data science tasks.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

### [150] [Frame-based Equivariant Diffusion Models for 3D Molecular Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19506)
*Mohan Guo,Cong Liu,Patrick Forré*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Frame-based diffusion for molecular generation achieving deterministic E(3)-equivariance with decoupled symmetry handling; introduces Global, Local, and Invariant Frame Diffusion variants; integrates EdgeDiT for edge-aware attention; achieves SOTA QM9 results and ~2x faster sampling than EDM, highlighting global structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between strict equivariance with costly architectures and relaxed symmetry for scalability by decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone via a frame-based diffusion paradigm, enabling scalable, flexible, and physically grounded molecular generation.

Method: Propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm and study three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (shared molecular frame), Local Frame Diffusion (node-specific frames with alignment constraints), and Invariant Frame Diffusion (pre-canonicalized invariant representations). Enhance expressivity with EdgeDiT, a diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention. Evaluate on QM9, compare to equivariant baselines, report NLLs, stability metrics, validity/uniqueness, and sampling speed (vs EDM).

Result: GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art QM9 performance: test NLL of -137.97 (standard scale) and -141.85 (double scale); atom stability 98.98%; molecular stability 90.51%. Outperforms all equivariant baselines, with high validity and uniqueness, and ~2x faster sampling than EDM.

Conclusion: Frame-based diffusion is a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, emphasizing the importance of global structure preservation and decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone; frames play a critical role in encoding E(3) symmetry in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

*Ali Baheri,Lars Lindemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCFM enforces energy-conserving and dissipative properties via a Strang-split, structure-preserving flow learning framework, yielding stable long-horizon dynamics and good terminal statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts; a principled approach that preserves conservation principles is needed.

Method: Decompose dynamics into a conservative-dissipative split for the vector field and sampler; train with conditional flow matching on short transitions; inference uses a Strang-prox scheme alternating a symplectic update with a proximal metric step; optional projection enforces strict decay when trusted energy is available; provides continuous and discrete-time guarantees linking parameterization to conservation and dissipation.

Result: On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and far fewer energy-increase events than an unconstrained neural flow, while achieving terminal distributional fit.

Conclusion: MCFM offers a principled, structure-preserving method for learning dissipative dynamics with stable rollouts and reliable terminal statistics.

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

### [152] [DAWM: Diffusion Action World Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning via Action-Inferred Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19538)
*Zongyue Li,Xiao Han,Yusong Li,Niklas Strauss,Matthias Schubert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAWM enables action-conditioned, return-conditioned diffusion world models for offline RL, paired with an inverse dynamics module, to deliver complete synthetic transitions compatible with one-step TD methods, yielding strong gains over prior diffusion baselines on D4RL with TD3BC/IQL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based world models excel at long-horizon trajectory synthesis but often do not generate actions, limiting compatibility with standard one-step TD offline RL. Joint state–reward–action models reduce practicality due to training complexity and performance drop. DAWM aims to bridge this gap with a modular, action-conditioned diffusion model.

Method: DAWM uses a diffusion-based world model to generate future state–reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go. An inverse dynamics model (IDM) infers actions, producing complete synthetic transitions for one-step TD offline RL. The design is modular to maintain computational efficiency while enabling TD-based training with existing algorithms.

Result: Empirically, conservative offline RL methods like TD3BC and IQL trained on DAWM-generated augmented trajectories outperform prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple D4RL tasks, demonstrating improved performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: DAWM provides a practical, scalable approach to integrate diffusion world models with one-step TD offline RL by producing action-conditioned trajectories and efficient action inference, leading to consistently better performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

### [153] [Learning Dynamics of Deep Learning -- Force Analysis of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19554)
*Yi Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A force-analogy framework to study how training examples influence each other during learning, decomposing influence into similarity and update strength to explain training dynamics and guide improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models learn along certain trajectories, why some finetuning methods succeed or fail, and why structured patterns are learned more readily.

Method: Model training is modeled as forces between examples; analyze pairwise influence during SGD, decompose into (i) similarity between examples and (ii) the effective update force; apply this to various tasks to interpret training dynamics and derive strategies.

Result: The framework clarifies non-trivial learning paths, explains some finetuning outcomes, and highlights when structured patterns are favored; yields new strategies to improve training.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic, interpretable lens on learning dynamics and a foundation for improving optimization, though the approach is still in development.

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

### [155] [Modular Machine Learning with Applications to Genetic Circuit Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19601)
*Jichi Wang,Eduardo D. Sontag,Domitilla Del Vecchio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular learning framework uses known composition structure to identify module input/output functions from data with less data, via the notion of modular identifiability. It shows a neural-network approach that respects modular structure, achieving better generalization than unstructured models in genetic-circuit-like systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When dealing with systems built from many modules, the architecture is known but module IO functions are not. Exploiting the compositional structure can drastically reduce training data and enable design of new systems by composing modules.

Method: Introduce modular identifiability and provide theoretical guarantees for a class of genetics-inspired systems. Use computational studies with a modular neural network that enforces the composition architecture to recover module IO functions and predict outputs, including out-of-distribution inputs; compare to a structure-agnostic neural network.

Result: The modular approach reduces data requirements and successfully recovers module IO functions from partial data. The structure-aware neural network generalizes to inputs outside the training distribution, whereas the agnostic network fails.

Conclusion: A modular learning framework that leverages composition knowledge can facilitate design of synthetic biological circuits and multi-module systems, with potential applicability to other domains by exploiting known architecture.

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

*Jiayi Xin,Aniruddh Raghu,Nick Bhattacharya,Adam Carr,Melanie Montgomery,Hunter Elliott*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal, domain-tailored approach outperforms large PLMs in predicting antibody reformating success, especially for unseen starting antibodies; supports efficient candidate prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address engineering challenges in antibody reformatting where function/stability may deteriorate and synthesiability may fail; need to predict reformats to guide design and save experiments.

Method: A supervised ML framework combining antibody sequence and structural context; domain-tailored multimodal representations; evaluation protocol mimicking deployment; tested on real-world reformatting dataset; comparison with large PLMs.

Result: PLMs do not outperform domain-tailored multimodal models; in new antibody/no data setting, best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy; reduces wasted experimental effort.

Conclusion: Domain-aware multimodal models provide robust predictive power for reformating success and practical utility in screening candidates; may guide design to improve success rates.

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

*Juan Manuel Perez,Kevin Garcia,Brooklyn Berry,Dongjin Song,Yifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a von Mises–Fisher hashing loss for deep time-series hashing that maps data to a hypersphere and models classes with distinct vMF distributions to maximize inter-class margin, reducing information loss from binarization and improving retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised deep hashing relies on discretization to produce binary codes, which can lead to significant information loss and degraded semantic fidelity. There is a need for a representation and loss that preserve semantic structure while enabling efficient binary-like indexing.

Method: Map inputs to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space and model each class as points drawn from a distinct von Mises–Fisher distribution. The loss is designed to maximize the separation (margin) between these vMF-distributed class representations to encourage clear semantic boundaries, reducing information loss during the eventual binarization step and improving retrieval efficiency.

Result: Empirical results show the proposed vMF hashing loss outperforms existing baselines on time-series hashing tasks. The authors also provide public code for reproducibility at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Modeling class distributions with vMF on a hypersphere provides a more information-preserving and semantically discriminative hashing framework for time-series indexing, yielding better retrieval performance and a robust protocol for supervised deep hashing without heavy discretization-induced loss.

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

### [158] [Mamba Modulation: On the Length Generalization of Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19633)
*Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Qiuhao Zeng,Xinyu Wang,Boxing Wang,Philippe Langlais,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectrum scaling of the state-transition matrices in Mamba-like state-space models yields robust long-context generalization; length extension is governed by the spectrum of the transition matrix A, not discretization step accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic attention complexity; sub-quadratic state-space models like Mamba offer scaling improvements but fail on longer contexts. Understanding and fixing length-generalization is essential for reliable long-context modeling.

Method: 1) Analyze how the spectrum of the transition matrix A influences state convergence as input length grows. 2) Argue that length-generalization is tied to A's spectrum rather than discretization time-step accumulation. 3) Propose spectrum scaling to modulate A per layer in pre-trained Mamba models. 4) Empirically validate improvements in long-context settings where Delta_t modulation fails.

Result: Spectral modulation of A in pre-trained Mamba models significantly improves long-context performance, outperforming naive Delta_t-based adjustments and stabilizing behavior as context length increases.

Conclusion: The paper links length-generalization in state-space models to the spectral properties of the transition matrices. Spectrum-aware adjustments offer a principled and effective path to robust long-context generalization for structured SSMs like Mamba.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

### [159] [TIMED: Adversarial and Autoregressive Refinement of Diffusion-Based Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19638)
*MohammadReza EskandariNasab,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIMED is a unified generative framework for time series that combines denoising diffusion (DDPM), a supervised autoregressive predictor with teacher forcing, a Wasserstein critic, and MMD loss, all built on masked attention and trained jointly to produce realistic, temporally coherent multivariate sequences that outperform state-of-the-art generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series data are often scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Generating realistic sequences requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies. Existing static-data generators fail to capture dynamics; a unified framework that jointly handles global structure, autoregressive dependencies, and distributional alignment is needed.

Method: TIMED integrates (i) a DDPM forward-reverse diffusion process to capture global structure, (ii) a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn next-step autoregressive dependencies, (iii) a Wasserstein critic providing adversarial feedback for temporal smoothness and fidelity, (iv) a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align real and synthetic distributions in feature space, and (v) masked attention architectures for sequence modeling, with all components trained jointly to model unconditional and conditional aspects of time series.

Result: Experimental results on diverse multivariate time series benchmarks show TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: TIMED offers a cohesive, unified approach that effectively captures both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series, improving realism, coherence, and diversity, with broad applicability to forecasting and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

*Hongyi Chen,Xiucheng Li,Xinyang Chen,Yun Cheng,Jing Li,Kehai Chen,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Spatial Structured Attention Block to model local and global spatial dependencies in global station weather forecasting, enabling scalable multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting with improved accuracy at low cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time-series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlations across the global weather network, which contradicts the intrinsic bidirectional spatial structure of weather observations and limits forecast performance.

Method: Partition the spatial graph into subgraphs; apply Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlations within each subgraph; aggregate nodes to subgraph representations and perform Inter-subgraph Attention to enable message passing between subgraphs, considering both spatial proximity and global correlation; build a multiscale forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales.

Result: Outperforms time series forecasting baselines by up to 16.8% while maintaining low running costs, demonstrating scalable, structured spatial correlation and ease of implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed Spatial Structured Attention Block enables stable, scalable multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting with explicit spatial structure, offering practical benefits for GSWF.

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

### [161] [Symbol-Temporal Consistency Self-supervised Learning for Robust Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19654)
*Kevin Garcia,Cassandra Garza,Brooklyn Berry,Yifeng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive framework guided by a bag-of-symbol representation improves robustness to distribution shifts in digital-health time series, yielding notable gains when human-behavior-induced shifts are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data in digital health are highly noisy and subject to concept drift and distribution shifts due to varying human behaviors, making generalizable deep models hard to train. The bag-of-symbol representation is insensitive to data warping, location shifts, and noise, suggesting it could guide learning toward shift-resistant representations.

Method: The authors propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation, leveraging contrastive learning to learn representations that are robust to warping, shifts, and noise by integrating the bag-of-symbol perspective into the learning process.

Result: Experiments show significantly better performance under substantial data-shifting conditions, indicating improved robustness and generalization when distribution shifts are present.

Conclusion: Incorporating bag-of-symbol guidance into self-supervised contrastive learning yields more robust time-series representations for digital health, particularly under behavior-driven shifts, with implications for more generalizable models.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

### [162] [Consistent Estimation of Numerical Distributions under Local Differential Privacy by Wavelet Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19661)
*Puning Zhao,Zhikun Zhang,Bo Sun,Li Shen,Liang Zhang,Shaowei Wang,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A wavelet-based distribution-estimation method under local differential privacy (LDP) for numerical data that prioritizes low-order coefficients to preserve mass, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance under Wasserstein and KS metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LDP methods excel on categorical data but struggle for numerical distributions due to mass-misalignment and evaluation metrics; there is a need for methods that ensure macroscopic accuracy and controlled mass relocation under LDP.

Method: Express the sample distribution as a wavelet expansion and estimate the wavelet coefficients under LDP, with a bias-variance tradeoff that prioritizes low-order (low-frequency) coefficients to preserve macroscopic accuracy of the distribution.

Result: The approach provides theoretical guarantees and experimentally outperforms existing solutions, achieving better accuracy under Wasserstein and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) distances.

Conclusion: A wavelet-based approach to distribution estimation under LDP is effective for numerical data, yielding accurate macroscopic distributions and robust performance.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

### [163] [Revisiting Performance Claims for Chest X-Ray Models Using Clinical Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19671)
*Andrew Wang,Jiashuo Zhang,Michael Oberst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using discharge summaries to create a prior probability (pre-test) for CXR labels, this work evaluates whether state-of-the-art CXR models rely on true diagnostic signal or on inferring clinical context. It reveals models perform best when pre-test probability is very low and degrade as pre-test probability rises; on balanced tests, performance drops when the shortcut to clinical context is removed, arguing for context-aware evaluation of clinical vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks on CXR datasets may overestimate clinical utility if models rely on clinical context (e.g., notes) rather to extract true image-based signals. The study proposes measuring model performance as a function of priors derived from discharge summaries to simulate clinicians' prior knowledge and to test for shortcut usage.

Method: For each CXR, derive a pre-test probability for each label from discharge summaries recorded before the image. Evaluate state-of-the-art CXR models across varying pre-test probabilities; compare performance on imbalanced vs balanced test sets to assess reliance on pre-test context. Analyze whether high average performance persists when the model can't exploit this contextual shortcut.

Result: Across several diagnostic labels, models perform best on cases with very low pre-test probability and worsen as pre-test probability increases. On a balanced test set where the shortcut is not present, performance drops sharply, suggesting much of the apparent diagnostic power comes from inferring clinical context rather than image signal.

Conclusion: Context-derived evaluation from clinical notes is a promising direction for rigorous, fine-grained assessment of clinical vision models, potentially revealing limitations of current SOTA models and guiding the development of more robust, context-aware evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

### [164] [C${}^2$Prompt: Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction for Federated Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19674)
*Kunlun Xu,Yibo Feng,Jiangmeng Li,Yongsheng Qi,Jiahuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C2Prompt improves federated continual learning by enforcing class-wise coherence during prompt communication, using LCDC and CPA to reduce intra-class disparities and inter-class confusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on FCL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address both temporal forgetting and spatial forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). Existing prompt-based FCL methods suffer from class-wise coherence issues: intra-class distribution gaps across clients that degrade semantic consistency and inter-prompt class-wise relevance leading to cross-class knowledge confusion, which exacerbate interference during prompt communication.

Method: Propose Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C2Prompt) with two components: LCDC (local class distribution compensation) to align intra-class distributions across clients, reinforcing intra-class knowledge; and CPA (class-aware prompt aggregation) to selectively strengthen class-relevant knowledge aggregation and alleviate inter-class confusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C2Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Enhancing class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication via LCDC and CPA effectively mitigates both spatial and temporal forgetting in prompt-based federated continual learning.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

### [165] [A Unified Noise-Curvature View of Loss of Trainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19698)
*Gunbir Singh Baveja,Mark Schmidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes per-layer predictive thresholds to prevent Loss of Trainability (LoT) in continual learning with Adam, combining a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility bound. A per-layer scheduler caps effective steps to stay below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across CReLU, Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learning-rate trajectories resembling canonical decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoT occurs when gradient steps stop yielding improvements as tasks evolve; single indicators (e.g., Hessian rank, norms, entropy) fail to reliably predict trainability. A practical, per-layer, predictive criterion is needed to anticipate and prevent stagnation.

Method: Develop a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound. Combine them into a per-layer predictive threshold. Implement a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layer's effective step below the threshold, producing stabilized training. Evaluate with concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay; learn learning-rate trajectories that resemble canonical decay.

Result: Per-layer threshold-based scheduler stabilizes training under LoT, improving accuracy across the tested regularizers. The learned learning-rate trajectories follow a canonical decay pattern.

Conclusion: A per-layer predictive threshold capturing gradient noise and curvature volatility provides a practical tool to mitigate LoT in continual learning with Adam, enabling stable training and better accuracy across multiple regularizers.

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

*Patrick Lutz,Aditya Gangrade,Hadi Daneshmand,Venkatesh Saligrama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear-attention Transformer trained on masked-block matrix completion discovers a unified, parameter-free iterative solver for prediction, estimation, and Nyström extrapolation via in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether a neural model can learn efficient, general-purpose numerical solvers for structured linear-algebra tasks without explicit algorithmic guidance.

Method: Train a linear-attention Transformer on millions of masked low-rank matrix completion prompts. Each prompt masks a block; the missing block may be a scalar target or an unseen Nyström kernel slice. The model observes input-output pairs with a mean-squared loss, without access to normal equations or handcrafted iterations, and is not told that tasks are related. After training, algebraic unrolling reveals a common, parameter-free update rule across regimes; analyze convergence and efficiency.

Result: The learned update rule is unified and parameter-free, applying across full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation. It achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, reduces distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate under rank-limited attention.

Conclusion: A transformer trained only to patch missing blocks implicitly discovers a resource-adaptive, unified iterative solver spanning prediction, estimation, and Nyström extrapolation, illustrating a powerful in-context learning capability for algorithm discovery.

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-MultiTask: a multi-task meta-learning framework for individualized treatment effect estimation in spine surgery, using IPW to reinforce causal validity; shows superior ITEs and PRO predictions on public/private datasets, enabling personalized surgical decisions; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical decisions in spinal fusion/scoliosis involve complex, heterogeneous causal relationships. Traditional statistics struggle to estimate ITEs robustly; need methods that handle task heterogeneity and confounding.

Method: Treat each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs posterior approach, surgery vs no surgery) as a separate task in a multi-task meta-learning setup, sharing representations across tasks. Incorporate inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective to improve causal validity. Evaluate on two datasets: public spinal fusion (1,017 patients) for complication severity across approaches; private AIS dataset (368) for PSF vs non-surgical management on PROs. Metrics: AUC by group; NN-PEHE and ATE.

Result: Achieves highest average AUC 0.84 in the anterior group and 0.77 in the posterior group; lowest NN-PEHE 0.2778 and ATE 0.0763 for ITEs; PRO predictions show NN-PEHE 0.2551 and ATE 0.0902; outperforms baselines in ITEs; code available.

Conclusion: X-MultiTask provides robust, patient-specific causal estimates to advance personalized spinal care and outcomes; practical with public/private datasets; code released.

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

TL;DR: A BERT-based regression method predicts systolic and diastolic blood pressure from speech with MAE ~136/124 mmHg and strong correlations, offering a cuffless approach for telemedicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for noninvasive, cuffless, reliable BP monitoring due to cuff-related issues (white-coat, masked hypertension) and patient discomfort, enabling real-time remote monitoring through speech analysis.

Method: Extract acoustic speech features, fine-tune a BERT model for regression on these features, train on a dataset of 95 participants, and evaluate using mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation (R); analyze training/validation loss to assess overfitting.

Result: MAE SBP ≈ 136 mmHg and DBP ≈ 124 mmHg with R ≈ 0.99 for SBP and 0.94 for DBP; indicates strong predictive correlations; training/validation losses show effective learning with minimal overfitting.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of cuffless BP estimation from speech using deep learning; supports potential deployment in telemedicine and remote health monitoring, improving patient care.

Abstract: This research presents a novel method for noninvasive arterial blood pressure
ABP prediction using speech signals employing a BERT based regression model
Arterial blood pressure is a vital indicator of cardiovascular health and
accurate monitoring is essential in preventing hypertension related
complications Traditional cuff based methods often yield inconsistent results

techniques we analyze speech signals to extract relevant patterns enabling real
time monitoring without the discomfort of conventional methods In our study we
employed a dataset comprising recordings from 95 participants ensuring diverse
representation The BERT model was fine tuned on extracted features from speech
leading to impressive performance metrics achieving a mean absolute error MAE
of 136 mmHg for systolic blood pressure SBP and 124 mmHg for diastolic blood
pressure DBP with R scores of 099 and 094 respectively These results indicate
the models robustness in accurately predicting blood pressure levels

### [169] [Frictional Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19771)
*Hyunwoo Kim,Hyo Kyung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Frictional Q-learning, a friction-inspired constraint for off-policy deep RL that bounds policy actions to stay near the replay buffer while avoiding the orthonormal action-space manifold, extending batch-constrained RL and delivering competitive results on continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extrapolation error in off-policy RL causes the learned policy to drift toward actions not represented in the replay buffer; a simple, physically interpretable constraint is needed to keep policy behavior within supported actions.

Method: Introduce Frictional Q-learning, a deep RL algorithm for continuous control that imposes a friction-like constraint on the action selection, constraining the agent’s actions to resemble those in the replay buffer while keeping distance from the orthonormal action-space manifold; this extends the batch-constrained RL framework.

Result: The method yields robust training and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: The frictional constraint provides an intuitive explanation for extrapolation error, preserves the simplicity of batch-constrained RL, and offers an effective approach for keeping policies within the support of the data.

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

TL;DR: Sobolev training speeds up ReLU network training by improving loss landscape conditioning, with explicit gradient/Hessian formulas proven under a Gaussian student-teacher model and validated numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the mechanisms by which Sobolev training enhances convergence and generalization, bridging theoretical guarantees with practical benefits.

Method: A rigorous theoretical framework in a student-teacher setting with Gaussian inputs and shallow networks. The authors derive exact population gradients and Hessians, analyze conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow, and provide convergence-rate results. They complement theory with extensive numerical experiments on modern deep learning tasks.

Result: Exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians are obtained; improvements in loss landscape conditioning and gradient-flow convergence rates are quantified; empirical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings and suggest Sobolev training benefits persist in modern tasks.

Conclusion: Sobolev training has a solid theoretical basis for accelerating convergence and improving generalization in ReLU networks, extending beyond simple models to modern deep learning tasks; the framework offers a foundation for understanding and further leveraging Sobolev objectives.

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss
functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization
compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training
accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a
student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

*Xiaocheng Fang,Jiarui Jin,Haoyu Wang,Che Liu,Jieyi Cai,Guangkun Nie,Jun Li,Hongyan Li,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces PPGFlowECG, a two-stage latent-space translator that converts PPG to high-fidelity, interpretable ECGs and improves cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection, validated on a large MCMED dataset with clinician validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG is the gold standard for cardiac monitoring but is impractical for continuous use; PPG offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiology. Generative PPG-to-ECG methods face semantic misalignment and high-dimensional modeling challenges, creating a need for robust translation to support screening.

Method: A two-stage framework. The CardioAlign Encoder aligns PPG and ECG into a shared latent space; latent rectified flow generates ECGs from the latent representation. The approach is evaluated on the MCMED dataset (over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from >118k ED visits with expert CVD annotations) and includes cardiologist-led assessments of the synthesized ECGs.

Result: Demonstrates effective PPG-to-ECG translation and CVD detection. Synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity, and clinician evaluations indicate improved diagnostic reliability, supporting potential real-world screening.

Conclusion: First study to evaluate on the clinical-grade MCMED dataset; the framework shows promise for scalable, ECG-free screening via PPG with interpretable generation and enhanced diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

### [172] [Faster, Smaller, and Smarter: Task-Aware Expert Merging for Online MoE Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19781)
*Ziyi Han,Xutong Liu,Ruiting Zhou,Xiangxiang Dai,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tanbr is a tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router for online MoE inference that merges experts based on estimated task distribution, achieving sublinear regret and substantial latency/memory reductions while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) inference on large models is challenging due to high parameter count, expensive routing, and lack of task labels in online settings—necessitating efficient, reliable task-aware expert merging in edge environments.

Method: Introduce Tanbr, a tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router. It estimates the task distribution from historical data to guide task-aware expert merging within a pre-trained MoE. A binary tree partitions the continuous space of merging weights, generating finer candidate weights. A neural bandit learns the non-linear mapping from merging weight to performance and selects the optimal merging. Presents sublinear regret analysis over T rounds.

Result: Tanbr achieves a sublinear regret bound of O(sqrt(T) log(T)) over T rounds in a continuous decision space. Empirically, it reduces inference latency by at least 45% and memory usage by up to 25%, while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Tanbr enables efficient and reliable online MoE inference in resource-constrained edge networks by estimating task distributions, performing task-aware expert merging via a tree-structured approach, and using neural bandits to optimize merging. It provides strong theoretical guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

*Carlo Bosio,Greg Woelki,Noureldin Hendy,Nicholas Roy,Byungsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RDAR learns per-agent relevance to prune input for a pre-trained driving policy by masking irrelevant agents; modeled as an MDP over binary agent masks, achieving near-parity with fewer inputs on a large dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention for agent interactions is quadratic and computationally heavy. Humans selectively attend to a few agents; RDAR aims to scale perception by identifying and dropping irrelevant agents without substantially harming driving performance.

Method: Formulate masking as a Markov Decision Process where each action is a binary mask over agents. RDAR learns per-agent relevance by selecting which agents to include/exclude input to a pre-trained behavior model. Evaluation on a large-scale driving dataset compares progress, safety, and performance against a state-of-the-art model.

Result: RDAR achieves comparable driving performance while processing significantly fewer agents than a state-of-the-art behavior model on a large-scale dataset, indicating accurate learned relevance measures.

Conclusion: RDAR provides an effective, scalable mechanism to focus on relevant agents, enabling efficient input processing without sacrificing driving quality; it reduces computational load while maintaining key performance metrics.

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

### [174] [VCRL: Variance-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19803)
*Guochao Jiang,Wenfeng Feng,Guofeng Quan,Chuzhan Hao,Yuewei Zhang,Guohua Liu,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VCRL introduces a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that uses the variance of rollout rewards to adaptively control sample difficulty for LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks, improving over baselines on five benchmarks and two models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rollout RL methods for LLMs in math reasoning ignore how sample difficulty affects learning, leading to suboptimal training. The reward variance can reflect sample difficulty, suggesting a curriculum that presents increasing challenge could align training with human-like learning progress.

Method: Propose VCRL, a curriculum-based RL framework that dynamically adjusts training sample difficulty by monitoring the variance of rewards across rollout groups (based on RLVR data). It emphasizes samples with moderate difficulty to maximize learning signal and adapts the curriculum during training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five mathematical benchmarks with two LLMs shows VCRL outperforms existing rollout RL baselines (e.g., GRPO, DAPO, GSPO) in terms of learning efficiency and final performance.

Conclusion: Aligning curriculum with reward variance provides a practical way to mimic human progression in mathematical reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for improving policy-based RL with LLMs.

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

*Zhijun Zeng,Weiye Gan,Junqing Chen,Zuoqiang Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSF introduces a decoupled offline/online score-based filtering framework using a set-transformer encoder and conditional diffusion to perform efficient posterior sampling in high-dimensional nonlinear systems without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional nonlinear filtering is challenging; score-based diffusion models require retraining for evolving priors, which is impractical in large systems.

Method: Offline prior modeling with a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model for online posterior sampling; decouples prior learning from posterior updates to enable scalable filtering across nonlinear dynamics.

Result: Empirical benchmarks show CSF achieves improved accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Conclusion: A scalable, retraining-free score-based filtering framework that separates offline prior modeling from online posterior sampling, enabling efficient tracking of evolving nonlinear systems.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

*Wei Liu,Eleni Chatzi,Zhilu Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KANs with univariate components represented by B-splines achieve minimax-optimal convergence O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)}) for Sobolev smoothness r, for both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative architectures; provides knot-number guidelines; simulations validate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a theoretically grounded, interpretable framework for multivariate nonparametric regression, offering a structured alternative to black-box models with provable convergence rates.

Method: Represent univariate components with B-splines within additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs; derive convergence guarantees and optimal knot guidelines; compare architectures; support theory with simulations.

Result: Proved minimax-optimal convergence rates for both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs; established guidelines for selecting the number of knots in B-splines; simulations corroborate the predicted rates.

Conclusion: KANs with B-spline components offer a principled, interpretable approach to nonparametric regression with strong theoretical guarantees, including practical knot-selection guidelines and potential as a structured alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

### [177] [BoreaRL: A Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Environment for Climate-Adaptive Boreal Forest Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19846)
*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Enoch Ofosu,Daniel Chukwuemeka Amaogu,Jérôme Pigeon,Richard Boudreault,Pooneh Maghoul,Juan Moreno-Cruz,Yuri Leonenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces BoreaRL, a first multi-objective RL benchmark for climate-adaptive boreal forest management. Finds an asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon goals are easier than thaw/permafrost preservation; curriculum learning helps in generalist settings; reveals distinct management philosophies and highlights current MORL limitations; open-sourced as a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils. Optimizing management for carbon sequestration while preserving permafrost is complex and inadequately supported by existing tools. A physi- cally grounded, multi-objective RL environment is needed to study trade-offs, develop robust policies, and benchmark MORL methods.

Method: Introduce BoreaRL, a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes forming a multi-objective RL environment. Supports site-specific and generalist training modes. Evaluate multi-objective RL algorithms, analyze learning progress, and compare preference-conditioned strategies versus curricula.

Result: Demonstrates a fundamental asymmetry: carbon objectives are easier to optimize than thaw/permafrost preservation objectives; thaw-focused policies show minimal progress. In generalist settings, simple preference-conditioned methods fail; a naive curriculum that samples training episodes yields better performance. Distinct strategies emerge: carbon-focused policies favor high-density conifer stands, while multi-objective policies balance species and density to protect permafrost and sustain carbon gain. BoreaRL is shown as a challenging yet valuable benchmark for MORL in climate applications.

Conclusion: Robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods. BoreaRL provides a valuable benchmark to drive development of more effective approaches and is open-sourced to accelerate research in climate-related MORL.

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

### [178] [Analyzing Generalization in Pre-Trained Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19849)
*Henrik Voigt,Paul Kahlmeyer,Kai Lawonn,Michael Habeck,Joachim Giesen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pre-trained transformer-based symbolic regression models perform well on data drawn from their pre-training distribution but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, creating a practical generalization gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well pre-trained transformer-based symbolic regression models generalize beyond their training distribution and to what extent they can handle real-world, out-of-distribution data.

Method: Conduct a systematic empirical study across several state-of-the-art transformer-based symbolic regression approaches, evaluating performance both within the pre-training distribution and on multiple out-of-distribution challenges.

Result: A pronounced generalization gap is observed: strong in-distribution performance but consistent degradation on out-of-distribution tasks across methods.

Conclusion: The generalization gap significantly limits the practical use of pre-trained symbolic regression models; addressing this gap is essential for real-world applicability and motivates improvements in data diversity, evaluation protocols, and possibly model/training strategies to enhance out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

### [179] [Oversampling and Downsampling with Core-Boundary Awareness: A Data Quality-Driven Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19856)
*Samir Brahim Belhaouari,Yunis Carreon Kahalan,Humaira Shaffique,Ismael Belhaouari,Ashhadul Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces boundary-aware data selection to separate boundary (informative) from core (redundant) samples in imbalanced classification, enabling boundary oversampling and core reduction; reports substantial F1 gains and dramatic dataset compression with preserved accuracy, with broad applicability to data-efficient learning and LLM-scale training; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced classification and the presence of near-boundary informative instances, alongside abundant redundant core samples, hinder performance and raise training costs. Intelligent sampling aims to improve decision boundary quality while reducing data processing needs.

Method: Identify and differentiate boundary versus core data; apply boundary data oversampling to boost informative boundary instances; apply core-aware reduction to compress the dataset (up to 90%) while preserving accuracy; validate on multiple benchmark datasets; discuss extensions to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning; provide a Python package at PyPI (adaptive-resampling).

Result: Boundary oversampling improves F1 by up to 10 percentage points on 96% of datasets; core-aware reduction achieves up to 90% data compression with preserved accuracy, described as 10x efficiency gain over the original dataset; claims potential for faster convergence and substantial computational savings across domains, including LLM training.

Conclusion: Intelligent, data-efficient sampling can substantially elevate performance and efficiency in imbalanced and broader learning contexts; the approach paves the way for faster convergence and better generalization, with practical tooling available for adoption.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force
expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements. Our code is
available as a Python package at https://pypi.org/project/adaptive-resampling/ .

*Shi Yin,Zujian Dai,Xinyang Pan,Lixin He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NextHAM introduces a symmetry-respecting Transformer and zeroth-step Hamiltonians to predict electronic-structure Hamiltonians with high generalization and efficiency, validated on a broad Materials-HAM-SOC benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing Hamiltonian prediction across diverse chemistries/structures is challenging due to high dimensionality and lack of symmetry; need a model that is stable and accurate across real/reciprocal space.

Method: 1) Zeroth-step Hamiltonians derived from initial DFT charge density serve as informative inputs and initial target estimates; 2) An E(3)-equivariant Transformer with high expressiveness; 3) training objective ensuring accuracy in real and reciprocal space to suppress ghost states and counter large overlap matrix condition numbers; dataset Materials-HAM-SOC with 17k structures across 68 elements and SOC effects.

Result: NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures on Materials-HAM-SOC.

Conclusion: This approach advances universal deep learning for Hamiltonian prediction, with broad-coverage datasets enabling generalization to diverse materials and including SOC effects.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has
offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT
methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the
high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the
generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology
and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian
prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and
expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials
electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

*Lorenzo Perini,Daniel Haimovich,Fridolin Linder,Niek Tax,Dima Karamshuk,Milan Vojnovic,Nastaran Okati,Pavlos Athanasios Apostolopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGrad is a scalable multicalibration algorithm that removes the need to specify protected subgroups and is production-tested at Meta across hundreds of models, often preserving or improving other performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable multicalibration across subgroups without manually listing protected groups, addressing scalability and metric trade-offs that limit adoption in industry.

Method: A novel, gradient-based multicalibration algorithm (MCGrad) that operates without explicit enumeration of protected groups, designed for scalability and practical deployment.

Result: MCGrad has been deployed in production at Meta on hundreds of models; demonstrated on public datasets with results showing stable or improved metrics such as log loss and PRAUC.

Conclusion: MCGrad lowers barriers to industrial adoption of multicalibration by eliminating the need for manual subgroup specification while maintaining scalability and often improving other ML evaluation metrics.

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early-stage self-supervised foundation model for critical care time series (Bi-Axial Transformer) trained on pooled EHR data; demonstrates transfer learning by fine-tuning on a mortality prediction task on a dataset distinct from training data, outperforming supervised baselines, especially with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap of limited large-scale, domain-specific models for critical care time series by leveraging self-supervised pretraining to enable generalizable, robust predictions in resource-limited settings.

Method: Pre-train a Bi-Axial Transformer on pooled electronic health record time-series data (self-supervised). Then fine-tune the model on a separate dataset for mortality prediction, evaluating transfer learning performance against supervised baselines.

Result: The model outperforms supervised baselines, with notable gains on small datasets (less than 5,000 samples), illustrating the effectiveness of self-supervised foundation models for critical care time series.

Conclusion: Self-supervised foundation models for critical care time series show promise for generalizable and robust clinical applications in settings with limited data; further validation and broader deployment considerations are warranted.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

### [183] [PromptCoT 2.0: Scaling Prompt Synthesis for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19894)
*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Zhuocheng Gong,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0 introduces an EM-driven refinement loop to generate harder, more diverse synthetic prompts for training large language models. It enables two post-training regimes—Self-Play and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)—and reports state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, underscoring prompt synthesis as a scalable axis for reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, human-curated training problems are scarce and costly. Existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow, limiting scaling of reasoning in LLMs. PromptCoT 2.0 aims to create a scalable, automated pipeline to produce challenging, diverse prompts that drive robust reasoning capabilities.

Method: Replace hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation–maximization (EM) loop that iteratively refines rationales to guide prompt construction. The synthetic prompts are used in two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces.

Result: In Self-Play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 achieves new state-of-the-art performance on AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and Codeforces (with notable Elo gains). In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts yields substantial accuracy improvements (AIME 24: 73.1; AIME 25: 65.6; LiveCodeBench v5: 53.4), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses show the generated prompts are harder and distributionally distinct from prior corpora.

Conclusion: PromptCoT 2.0 demonstrates that prompt synthesis—guided by an EM-refined rationales loop—can serve as a scalable axis for advancing reasoning in open‑source models. The approach yields both harder problem sets and empirical performance gains, and the authors release code to support future research and replication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

### [184] [Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19901)
*Xinyu Liu,Chao Qin,Wei You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cast pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits as a maximin two-player game between an experimenter and a skeptic; introduce Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP) and a posterior-sampling learning algorithm; prove convergence of the game value via a differential-inclusion framework with a Lyapunov function, yielding a vanishing duality gap; numerical validation supports the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient identification of the correct hypothesis among finite alternatives under structural constraints, with guarantees for a projection-free, tuning-free algorithm in a maximin (saddle-point) setting.

Method: Formulate a mixed-strategy skeptic to yield a concave-convex saddle-point problem; develop Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP) with one-hot updates aligned to bandit sampling; address pathologies (nonunique optima, zero-mass designs, bilinear objectives, boundary nonsmoothness) via a differential-inclusion analysis; analyze continuous-time limit with a Lyapunov function ensuring exponential decay; discretize updates and prove convergence; propose a posterior-sampling learning algorithm built on FWSP.

Result: Demonstrates convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits; Lyapunov function decays exponentially, yielding vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value; discrete-time FWSP-based updates likewise converge; numerical experiments corroborate the vanishing duality gap.

Conclusion: A FWSP-based, projection-free, tuning-free framework for pure exploration in structured bandits with strong convergence guarantees; includes a posterior-sampling algorithm and empirical validation, and handles challenging boundary/pathology issues intrinsic to structured linear-bandit settings.

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

### [185] [Latent Iterative Refinement Flow: A Geometric-Constrained Approach for Few-Shot Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19903)
*Songtao Li,Zhenyu Liao,Tianqi Hou,Ting Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF) for few-shot generation by densifying a geometrically structured latent manifold. It learns a manifold-preserving latent space and uses an iterative generate–correct–augment cycle with a contractive correction operator, supported by a convergence theorem. Demonstrates scalability to high-resolution AFHQ-Cat and through ablations shows both components are essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot generative modeling struggles with overfitting and mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models risks inheriting biases and losing latent-space geometry. A data-efficient framework that preserves geometric-semantic structure of the data while enabling diverse generation is needed.

Method: Train an autoencoder with a novel manifold-preservation loss to create a stable latent space that preserves geometric/semantic relationships. Use an iterative generate–correct–augment cycle where a geometric correction operator (a contractive mapping) refines samples toward the data manifold while maintaining diversity. Prove a Convergence Theorem showing decreasing Hausdorff distance to the true data manifold. Validate scalability by generating coherent, high-resolution images (AFHQ-Cat) and perform ablations to verify the importance of both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive correction.

Result: Demonstrates the framework's scalability to high-quality, high-resolution samples (AFHQ-Cat); ablations confirm both key components are essential; provides theoretical guarantees (Convergence Theorem) and practical effectiveness in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: LIRF offers a theoretically grounded and practically effective solution for few-shot generation by preserving latent-space geometry and using a contractive, location-correcting refinement loop to progressively densify the data manifold, addressing overfitting and mode collapse in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

### [186] [On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19921)
*Balazs Pejo,Marcell Frank,Krisztian Varga,Peter Veliczky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contribution scoring in federated learning is fragile due to architectural sensitivity and poisoning; aggregation choices and attackers distort scores; Flower framework experiments show need for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness and incentivization rely on accurate contribution evaluation; vulnerabilities undermine reliable scoring and participation.

Method: Analyze impact of various aggregation methods (beyond simple averaging); simulate poisoning attacks; extensive experiments across datasets and model architectures; implemented within the Flower framework.

Result: Both aggregation method choice and presence of attackers distort contribution scores; significant distortions observed across experiments; indicates fragility of current evaluation schemes.

Conclusion: Calls for robust, abuse-resistant contribution evaluation schemes and future work to design more reliable scoring mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

*Remo Sasso,Michelangelo Conserva,Dominik Jeurissen,Paulo Rauber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot exploration with visual foundation models can guide exploration in RL but struggles with low-level control; a simple on-policy hybrid approach in an ideal setting can improve early sample efficiency, illustrating potential and limits of using foundation models for exploration rather than end-to-end control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether LLMs and VLMs can serve as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks and understand the 'knowing-doing' gap between high-level inference and precise control.

Method: Benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to assess zero-shot exploration. Analyze a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled best-case scenario to test bridging this gap.

Result: VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input but consistently fail at precise low-level control (the knowing-doing gap). In the idealized on-policy hybrid setting, VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, illustrating both potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than end-to-end control.

Conclusion: Foundation models may be useful for guiding exploration rather than replacing end-to-end control. The results highlight a gap to bridge and show that, in a best-case scenario, guided exploration can improve sample efficiency, informing future work on bridging strategies and limitations.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompting-based AD detection from speech transcripts achieves strong results on ADReSS with MMSE-anchored probabilities and multimodal reasoning prompts (≈0.82 accuracy, ≈0.83–0.86 AUC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve training-free dementia detection from speech transcripts by leveraging few-shot prompting, MMSE alignment, and multimodal reasoning to boost interpretability.

Method: Zero-shot and few-shot prompting with a class-balanced protocol on the ADReSS dataset, using nested interleave and a strict schema. Two variants: (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting, mapping MMSE bands to probabilities for AUC computation; (ii) Reasoning-augmented Prompting, using a multimodal LLM (GPT-5) to incorporate Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE to generate reasoning and MMSE-aligned probabilities; evaluation remains transcript-only. Up to 20 examples per class.

Result: MMSE-Proxy Prompting achieved 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC; Reasoning-augmented Prompting achieved 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To the authors’ knowledge, first ADReSS study anchoring probabilities to MMSE and using multimodal construction for interpretability; both variants set new prompting-based performance on the task.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that prompting-based, training-free AD detection from speech can reach strong performance, with MMSE anchoring enabling calibrated probabilities and multimodal reasoning enhancing interpretability without compromising transcript-only evaluation.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,
and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains
transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this
is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use
multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

*Emmanouil Panagiotou,Benoît Ronval,Arjun Roy,Ludwig Bothmann,Bernd Bischl,Siegfried Nijssen,Eirini Ntoutsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TABFAIRGDT is a lightweight, non-deep generative method that uses autoregressive decision trees with soft leaf resampling to generate fair synthetic tabular data, claiming superior fairness-utility trade-offs and much faster generation than SOTA deep models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in machine learning is hindered by bias in training data, and many current solutions rely on deep architectures that can be slow and data-hungry. There is a need for a simple, non-parametric, data-level bias mitigation method for tabular data that preserves utility and scales.

Method: A non-parametric autoregressive decision-tree model (TABFAIRGDT) with a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while maintaining predictive performance. It handles mixed feature types without assuming underlying distributions and is CPU-efficient with no data preprocessing.

Result: The approach reportedly outperforms state-of-the-art deep generative models on benchmark fairness datasets, achieving a better fairness-utility trade-off and higher synthetic data quality, along with a ~72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline. It can generate fair data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10k samples) in about one second on a standard CPU.

Conclusion: TABFAIRGDT offers an efficient, scalable alternative to deep generative models for fair synthetic tabular data generation, suitable for real-world fairness-sensitive tasks. It emphasizes non-parametric, fast generation without heavy preprocessing, though empirical validation on more diverse datasets would help confirm generality.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

TL;DR: Veo 3 shows broad zero-shot abilities across diverse vision tasks, hinting that video models can become unified, generalist vision foundation models, similar to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether scaling and web-scale training of video models yield emergent general-purpose, zero-shot vision capabilities, enabling versatile perception and reasoning.

Method: Train and deploy Veo 3 on large-scale video data; evaluate zero-shot performance across tasks (segmentation, edge detection, image editing, physics understanding, affordances, tool use); demonstrate visual reasoning like mazes and symmetry.

Result: Veo 3 can solve tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for; exhibits emergent zero-shot capabilities; demonstrates broad versatility and early visual reasoning; indicates potential for a unified generalist vision foundation model.

Conclusion: Video models may follow a path toward unified, generalist vision foundation models, paralleling LLMs in generalization and zero-shot capability.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

*Mohammad Tabish,Benedict Leimkuhler,Stefan Klus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fast, randomized neural network method (RaNNDy) learns transfer operators and their spectral decompositions by fixing hidden-layer weights and training only the output layer, yielding closed-form eigenfunctions and uncertainty estimates; demonstrated on Koopman, Perron–Frobenius, and Schrödinger operators across diverse dynamical and quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently extract spectral properties from data without the heavy training burden and hyperparameter sensitivity of deep nets, while providing direct eigenfunction representations and quantified uncertainties for operators arising in dynamical systems and quantum problems.

Method: Use randomized neural networks with fixed hidden-layer weights; train only the output layer, which admits a closed-form solution representing eigenfunctions of the operator. Employ ensemble learning to estimate uncertainties. Apply to Koopman and Perron–Frobenius operators, as well as the Schrödinger operator, and validate on stochastic dynamics, protein folding, and quantum harmonic oscillator scenarios.

Result: Achieves substantial reductions in training time with negligible accuracy loss; provides closed-form eigenfunctions and actionable uncertainty estimates via ensembles; demonstrates versatility across multiple operator types and application domains, while also highlighting certain weaknesses.

Conclusion: RaNNDy offers an efficient, versatile framework for data-driven spectral analysis of transfer operators, delivering direct eigenfunction representations and uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to dynamical systems and quantum problems; it trades some flexibility for speed and simplicity, and may have limitations in certain regimes.

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

*Feiyang Fu,Tongxian Guo,Zhaoqiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSD enables fast, high-fidelity sampling in discrete diffusion models by distilling a high-quality teacher into a lightweight student with learnable sampling coefficients; LSD+ adds non-uniform time scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models are powerful but suffer from slow sampling due to many steps; increasing step size hurts quality due to cumulative decoding and discretization errors. A learning-based distillation of sampling dynamics aims to preserve quality with fewer steps.

Method: Train a student sampler with few steps to align its intermediate score trajectory with a high-quality teacher trained with many steps, optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adapt sampling dynamics. LSD+ additionally learns non-uniform time schedules to allocate steps where needed.

Result: Outperforms existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks.

Conclusion: LSD provides an effective distillation framework for fast, high-fidelity discrete diffusion sampling; LSD+ further improves efficiency and quality by learning non-uniform step schedules.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm and TimePrism model; replaces sampling in probabilistic forecasting with a finite set of {scenario, probability} pairs; TimePrism achieves strong results with a lightweight architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based forecasting has drawbacks: lack of explicit probabilities, limited coverage, and high computational cost; a non-sampling approach could provide calibrated probabilities and efficiency.

Method: Define Probabilistic Scenarios to output a finite set of plausible futures with probabilities; implement TimePrism with three parallel linear layers; train to learn a set of scenarios and their probabilities, rather than modeling a full probability distribution.

Result: TimePrism attains 9/10 state-of-the-art results across five datasets on two metrics; demonstrates strong performance with a simple architecture and the proposed paradigm.

Conclusion: Probabilistic Scenarios is a promising new paradigm for forecasting beyond sampling, warranting further exploration and potential broader adoption in forecasting research.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPLoRA introduces a memory-efficient ALS-based optimizer for LoRA that matches SVDLoRA performance with much less memory, including momentum support and a K-FAC variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between standard LoRA fine-tuning and full SVD-based LoRA by reducing memory and computation, while enabling compatibility with existing LoRA preconditioning and momentum methods.

Method: Reformulate LoRA optimization as an interpretable subproblem and solve it with alternating least squares (ALS). Only 1–2 ALS steps are needed to closely approximate truncated SVD, avoiding formation of the full matrix. A low-rank estimate (LoRSum) enables momentum; memory usage is about 3x the number of LoRA parameters, comparable to Adam. A scaled variant using the K-FAC metric is also proposed.

Result: Across linear tasks, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA performance while using significantly less memory.

Conclusion: OPLoRA provides a memory-efficient optimization pathway that narrows the performance gap between LoRA and full SVD-LoRA, supports momentum via LoRSum, can incorporate preconditioning, and offers a scalable K-FAC variant for potential gains.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear
task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches
SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub
repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

TL;DR: Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL): a diffusion-based data augmentation in latent space via a VAE over Scattering Transformer features, combined with supervised contrastive learning, yielding robust ECG representations with AUROC 0.7815 on PhysioNet 2017.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biosignal representations suffer from inadequate augmentations that fail to capture physiological variability; robust, discriminative features require augmentation techniques that reflect real-world noise and variations.

Method: Train a lightweight VAE on Scattering Transformer features to form a latent space; apply the diffusion forward process to generate multiple noisy views of latent embeddings; train a U-Net encoder with a supervised contrastive loss across diffusion steps to learn noise-robust, discriminative representations.

Result: Proof-of-concept evaluation on PhysioNet 2017 ECG achieving AUROC 0.7815, indicating competitive performance and demonstrating diffusion-driven contrastive learning can produce noise-invariant, separable embeddings.

Conclusion: Introduces a new paradigm for representation learning: using diffusion process as a data augmentation and training signal for contrastive objectives, enabling robust, separable representations; future work on scaling, other biosignals, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal
filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and
engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,
\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairEquityFL proposes a fairness-oriented FL framework for IoV that uses a sampling equalizer and an outlier detector to ensure equitable participation and identify malicious clients, suspending them when necessary; evaluated on FEMNIST with results showing substantial improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In IoV-based FL, only a subset of clients participates in each round, creating dynamics and heterogeneity that can lead to unfair participation and vulnerability to malicious clients. There is a gap in applying fairness-driven client selection specifically for dynamic, heterogeneous IoV environments.

Method: Introduce FairEquityFL with a selector module that includes a sampling equalizer to ensure fair collaboration opportunities for all clients. The selector monitors and controls participation per round and incorporates an outlier detection mechanism based on model performance (accuracy/loss fluctuations) to flag and temporarily suspend suspicious clients.

Result: Simulation on FEMNIST shows FairEquityFL outperforms baseline FL frameworks by a considerable margin.

Conclusion: FairEquityFL enables equitable client participation in FL for IoV through fairness-aware client selection and robust outlier-based mitigation of malicious participants, enhancing overall performance compared to baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

*Albert Kjøller Jacobsen,Johanna Marie Gegenfurtner,Georgios Arvanitidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes geometry-aware input noise on data manifolds to improve generalization and robustness; projects ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space, maps via geodesics, or uses Brownian motion on the manifold; extends to learned manifolds; shows gains on highly curved manifolds and parity with noise-free training on simpler manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambient-space perturbations ignore intrinsic data geometry, potentially misregularizing the gradient. By injecting noise that respects the data manifold, the method aims to deliver more effective regularization and improved generalization across manifold geometries.

Method: Three noise schemes on manifolds: (1) project ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space at a data point and then map along the tangent plane; (2) map the noise onto the manifold using the associated geodesic curve to ensure end-points lie on the manifold; (3) apply Brownian motion on the manifold (random steps along the manifold). The approach is described as extendable to learned data manifolds, and is evaluated in terms of generalization and robustness to hyperparameter choices.

Result: Geometry-aware noise improves generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, and performs at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware perturbations that respect data geometry offer a practical regularization that enhances generalization and robustness; the framework can extend to learned manifolds and can be integrated into standard training to exploit intrinsic data structure.

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StableUN introduces a stability-driven unlearning framework using bi-level, neighborhood-aware optimization to resist relearning/jailbreaking while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional forgetting losses push parameters into sharp minima that are highly sensitive to small perturbations; such fragile regions enable efficient relearning attacks to recover forgotten knowledge.

Method: Bi-level feedback-guided optimization: integrate forgetting feedback (adversarial perturbations probing neighborhoods) with remembering feedback (preserving utility) via gradient projection to seek stable parameter regions.

Result: On WMDP and MUSE benchmarks, StableUN significantly improves robustness against relearning and jailbreaking while maintaining competitive utility.

Conclusion: Shifting optimization toward stable regions closes the gap between apparent unlearning and true knowledge removal, offering stronger, attack-resilient unlearning with acceptable utility costs.

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregularly sampled measurement data in Hamiltonian systems; existing symplectic ML models (SympNets, HénonNets) rely on fixed-step data and may be ill-suited for adaptive time stepping; there is a need for time-adaptive symplectic integrators.

Method: Propose T-HénonNets, a symplectic-by-design neural network architecture that supports adaptive time stepping; extend the framework to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems; establish universal approximation theorems for separable Hamiltonians; discuss difficulties with non-separable Hamiltonians; validate via numerical experiments.

Result: The work provides universal approximation guarantees for separable Hamiltonians with the proposed time-adaptive architecture and demonstrates, through numerical experiments, that T-HénonNets can learn time-adaptive symplectic flows; it also clarifies that extending the approach to non-separable Hamiltonians is more challenging.

Conclusion: T-HénonNets offer a principled method for learning time-adaptive symplectic integrators, including extension to non-autonomous systems; universal approximation is established for the separable case, while non-separable cases require further theoretical and algorithmic development, supported by numerical evidence.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA
functional classification. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

TL;DR: Bottom-up energy-per-query estimation for large-scale LLMs using token throughput; reveals current per-query energy, growth with longer tokens, and potential efficiency gains; highlights implications for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public energy estimates for LLM inference are inconsistent and often overstated; a credible per-query energy metric is needed for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and prioritizing efficiency as inference scales.

Method: Bottom-up methodology based on token throughput on an H100 GPU node under realistic workloads and PUE. Measures energy per query for frontier-scale models (>200B parameters). Extends to test-time scaling with 15x more tokens per query. Quantifies potential gains at model, serving platform, and hardware levels; compares production vs non-production estimates.

Result: Median energy per query 0.34 Wh (IQR 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models; energy per query rises 13x to 4.32 Wh with 15x tokens; non-production estimates can overstate energy by 4-20x; efficiency interventions yield 1.5-3.5x per-query reductions, up to 8-20x when combined; baseline daily energy for 1B queries ~0.8 GWh/day; with long queries 1.8 GWh/day; efficiency reduces to 0.9 GWh/day.

Conclusion: Targeted efficiency across model, serving platform, and hardware can deliver substantial energy savings; bottom-up estimates align with production measurements and can temper energy growth in AI deployments; emphasizes system-level energy planning akin to past data-center efficiency improvements.

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these
reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the
basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

*Prabhat Karmakar,Sayan Gupta,Ilaksh Adlakha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compact xLRA framework using CP tensor decomposition predicts local elastic strains from microstructure with high data efficiency and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently learning the structure–property relationships in high-dimensional microstructures for mechanical response without resorting to expensive physics-based simulations; improve data efficiency and generalizability across material classes.

Method: Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA) employing canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition, adaptively incorporating higher rank terms (max rank 4) to map microstructure to local elastic response; trained on as little as 5% of data; demonstrates transferability across two-phase composites and polycrystalline materials.

Result: Accurate predictions of local elastic strain fields with a max rank of 4; strong data efficiency (5% training data); cross-material transferability; outperforms contemporary methods in accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, with six orders of magnitude fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: xLRA provides an efficient, scalable framework for predicting elastic response from microstructures, enabling robust structure–property mappings across representative material systems.

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

TL;DR: User simulation emerges as essential, not optional, for progressing AGI by enabling scalable evaluation, data generation, and adaptive learning; calls for coordinated advances in simulations and intelligent agents and a prioritized research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGI progress is bottlenecked by the difficulty of rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems and by the need for vast interaction data to train adaptive agents.

Method: Conceptual analysis and synthesis: argue for the central role of user simulation, discuss interdisciplinary requirements for realistic simulators, identify key challenges (including those related to large language models), and outline a future research agenda.

Result: Offers a conceptual framework linking user simulation to AGI goals; identifies interdisciplinary challenges and proposes a roadmap rather than empirical results.

Conclusion: User simulation is a critical catalyst for AGI; advancing simulation technology and intelligent task agents in tandem is necessary, with a forthcoming research agenda to guide work across disciplines.

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

### [229] [Evaluation-Aware Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19464)
*Shripad Vilasrao Deshmukh,Will Schwarzer,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvA-RL introduces evaluation-aware RL that optimizes policy return while minimizing evaluation error, aiming to improve evaluation reliability with limited data; it reveals a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance under a fixed value-prediction scheme, mitigated by co-learning an assessment-conditioned value predictor; demonstrated across discrete and continuous domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy evaluation in RL for safety-critical deployment suffers high variance and bias due to limited data, long horizons, and model mismatch; traditional RL training ignores evaluation reliability, risking deployment in unknown environments.

Method: Formalize the EvA-RL framework to train a policy that maximizes expected return while minimizing expected evaluation error under a value-prediction scheme. Provide an instantiation to enable accurate evaluation with few rollouts in an assessment environment (potentially different from deployment). Analyze tradeoffs, and extend with co-learning of an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments reveal a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme. Introducing a co-trained assessment-conditioned value predictor reduces evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns across diverse discrete and continuous domains.

Conclusion: Evaluation should be treated as a first-class principle in RL training. EvA-RL lays the foundation for a family of methods that prioritize reliable evaluation during training and offer improved evaluation reliability with minimal sacrifice to policy performance.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

### [230] [Estimating the Self-Consistency of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19489)
*Robert Nowak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Under a fixed compute budget B = m n, allocating prompts and repeats optimally for estimating LLM self-consistency yields a rough rule m, n ∝ sqrt(B); i.e., a balanced split between sampling more prompts and repeating per-prompt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reliability of LLM answers by aggregating responses and understanding how to allocate compute resources when estimating self-consistency across prompts.

Method: Analytical derivation of an estimator for LLM self-consistency with m prompts sampled from the task distribution and n repeats per prompt, under a total compute budget B = m n; optimization of estimation error under the budget yields the scaling m, n ∝ sqrt(B).

Result: The analysis finds that the estimator’s performance is optimized when the number of prompts and the number of repeats per prompt scale with the square root of the budget, i.e., a rough split m, n ∝ sqrt(B).

Conclusion: For a fixed compute budget, a practical guideline is to allocate resources roughly as sqrt(B) for the number of prompts and sqrt(B) repeats per prompt, balancing exploration (more prompts) and replication (more repeats) to improve self-consistency estimation.

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and
aggregate responses to improve reliability. This short note analyzes an
estimator of the self-consistency of LLMs and the tradeoffs it induces under a
fixed compute budget $B=mn$, where $m$ is the number of prompts sampled from
the task distribution and $n$ is the number of repeated LLM calls per prompt;
the resulting analysis favors a rough split $m,n\propto\sqrt{B}$.

### [231] [Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19517)
*Sai Teja Reddy Adapala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a formal theory of computational cognitive load (Context Saturation and Attentional Residue) and the ICE benchmark to study multi-hop reasoning under load; finds small/open-source models collapse under load, while a larger model shows partial resilience; argues cognitive-load testing is essential for AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between static benchmark performance and behavior under dynamic cognitive load; understand mechanisms behind errors and potential hallucinations when reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: Proposes a formal theory of cognitive load; develops the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE) benchmark that deconfounds and manipulates Context Saturation and Attentional Residue; conducts a large replication study (N=10 per item, 200 questions) across five instruction-tuned models to measure performance under varying load.

Result: Small open-source models (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) perform at 0% accuracy across conditions on this high-load task; Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 achieves ~85% in control but shows significant degradation with load (β = -0.003 per % load, p < 0.001).

Conclusion: Cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures; dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing like ICE is essential to evaluate AI resilience and safety; supports views of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty.

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes StepEval: a plug-in, vision-language model–driven framework for per-subgoal evaluation in robot learning, enabling subgoal success vectors, latency/cost diagnostics, and model-agnostic, open-source adoption; aims to shift evaluation from final success to stepwise scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot learning papers typically report only a binary final success rate (SR), masking performance across a multi-step task. Subgoal-level reporting could reveal where policies succeed or fail (e.g., grasp vs. pour). The authors seek a scalable, community-driven evaluation blueprint that leverages VLMs to judge subgoal outcomes from recorded visuals without mandating new benchmarks, APIs, or heavy overhead.

Method: Outline design principles for a StepEval framework: a plug-in evaluation system that uses vision-language models as automated judges to infer subgoal outcomes from images/videos. The primary artifact is per-subgoal SR vectors; additional metrics (latency, cost estimates) support optimization. Emphasizes model-agnosticism, support for single- or multi-view inputs, and lightweight adoption for labs, with an extensible seed for open-source contributions.

Result: Conceptual blueprint rather than empirical results. Demonstrates potential benefits of richer, interpretable policy evaluation and community-driven standards, but no reported datasets, experiments, or benchmarks using StepEval in this abstract.

Conclusion: A shared direction toward standardizing step-level evaluation in robot learning through an extensible, open-source StepEval framework that scores the steps, not just the final goal, to improve reproducibility and diagnostic insight.

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

TL;DR: Small language models (<10B) with an agentic framework can rival or exceed larger models in genomics QA, achieving up to 98% accuracy on GeneTuring with substantially lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination and high computational costs in genomics question answering; enable efficient, accessible, and robust ML-powered genomic tools.

Method: Develop the Nano Bio-Agent (NBA) framework combining task decomposition, tool orchestration, and API access within established genomics resources (e.g., NCBI, AlphaGenome) and evaluate various 3–10B parameter SLMs in an agentic setup.

Result: The best model–agent combination achieves 98% accuracy on GeneTuring; 3–10B parameter SLMs consistently reach 85–97% accuracy while requiring far less computational resources than larger models, showing comparable or superior performance.

Conclusion: SLMs with an agentic framework offer promising efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of genomics tools without sacrificing robustness or accuracy.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion
parameters) for genomics question answering via agentic framework to address
hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

TL;DR: Proposes evaluation as inference framework for AI benchmarks, addressing sensitivity to perturbations and offering uncertainty-aware methods and an adaptive algorithm to reduce sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark scores are widely used but potentially misrepresent true capability; need a theory-grounded evaluation approach, inspired by psychometrics, to quantify ability and its uncertainty.

Method: Build a theory-of-capability model, derive estimators for ability that incorporate perturbation sensitivity and finite-sample uncertainty; introduce an adaptive data collection algorithm to lower sample complexity.

Result: A principled evaluation-as-inference framework and methods for inferring AI capability under perturbations and uncertainty, including an adaptive algorithm that reduces data requirements; demonstrated as a proof-of-concept.

Conclusion: This framework lays the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy AI capability estimates from benchmarks.

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

### [235] [SteinerSQL: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning for Text-to-SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19623)
*Xutao Mao,Tao Liu,Hongying Zan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-centric Steiner-tree framework unifies mathematical reasoning and schema navigation for Text-to-SQL, achieving new SOTA results on LogicCat (36.10% execution accuracy) and Spider2.0-Lite (40.04%), using Gemini-2.5-Pro.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that require both advanced mathematical reasoning and careful schema navigation. Existing methods tend to address these challenges separately, leading to fractured reasoning and potential logical/structural errors. A unified, principled framework is needed to jointly handle both aspects.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) mathematical decomposition to identify required tables (terminals); (2) construct an optimal reasoning scaffold via a Steiner tree optimization; (3) multi-level validation to ensure correctness of the resulting query.

Result: SteinerSQL achieves new state-of-the-art execution accuracy on two challenging benchmarks: LogicCat (36.10%) and Spider2.0-Lite (40.04%), using Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Conclusion: SteinerSQL offers a unified paradigm for Text-to-SQL by framing the problem as a single graph-centric optimization, paving the way for more robust and principled solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

*Anisha Garg,Engin Tekin,Yash More,David Bick,Nishit Neema,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a pairwise Explanatory Verifier trained with RL (GRPO) to calibrate confidence and generate NL reasoning for solutions, boosting test-time strategies and detecting hard failure modes (e.g., both candidates wrong) where majority voting fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-evaluation quality limits scaling of reasoning models; need calibrated confidence estimates and interpretable explanations to guide test-time strategies.

Method: Train a pairwise Verifier that takes candidate solutions, outputs calibrated confidence scores and natural-language reasoning; trained via reinforcement learning GRPO; used to guide strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection.

Result: Improves accuracy and efficiency of test-time strategies; excels at identifying challenging failure modes (identical incorrect candidates), outperforming standard methods such as majority voting.

Conclusion: A calibrated, explanatory verifier can significantly enhance test-time reasoning by providing interpretable signals and robust failure detection, enabling more reliable and efficient inference.

Abstract: Advanced test-time computing strategies are essential for scaling reasoning
models, but their effectiveness is capped by the models' poor self-evaluation.
We propose a pairwise Explanatory Verifier, trained via reinforcement learning
(GRPO), that produces calibrated confidence scores and associated natural
language reasoning for generated solutions. Our verifier improves the accuracy
and efficiency of test-time strategies like best-of-n and self-reflection.
Crucially, it excels at identifying challenging failure modes, such as when
both candidate solutions are identically incorrect, succeeding where standard
methods like majority voting fail.

*Cheng Qian,Zuxin Liu,Akshara Prabhakar,Jielin Qiu,Zhiwei Liu,Haolin Chen,Shirley Kokane,Heng Ji,Weiran Yao,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Caiming Xiong,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simulator-based framework (UserRL) for training and evaluating user-centric agents shows that SFT cold start, trajectory scoring, and simulated user strength significantly shape multi-turn learning under GRPO; open-source simulators offer cost-effective options and design choices matter as much as model scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning robust, multi-turn interactions with users, the lack of standardized evaluation, and the need to study how reward shaping & user simulation affect RL performance in agentic models.

Method: Introduce UserRL with standardized gym environments paired with simulated users, systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation, analyze learning under the GRPO algorithm across Qwen3 models, and compare training using stronger simulated users versus open-source simulators.

Result: Three findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical to unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; (iii) stronger simulated users facilitate training, but open-source simulators remain cost-effective and transferable. Public code and data are provided.

Conclusion: Careful design of reward shaping and user simulation is as crucial as model scale for building robust user-centric agentic models; UserRL offers a practical pathway and resources to advance this domain.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

*Yuanxin Wang,Pawel Filipczuk,Anisha Garg,Amaan Dhada,Mohammad Hassanpour,David Bick,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Optimized CEPO workflow lets small/open-source models beat much larger models in reasoning with less compute; open-sourcing the workflow to spur research; champions co-design of orchestration with model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in contemporary LLM reasoning caused by verbose, poorly instructed models and external orchestration, by exploiting capability-cost trade-offs to enable smaller models to perform competitively.

Method: Propose and instantiate an optimized reasoning workflow named CEPO; analyze the capability–cost trade-off; demonstrate co-design of orchestration frameworks aligned with model capabilities; empirically show smaller models outperforming larger ones; announce open-sourcing of the workflow.

Result: Demonstrates that CEPO enables small-to-medium open-source models to surpass models many times their size in reasoning tasks; workflow will be released openly to accelerate research; highlights a path for co-design of orchestration with model capabilities.

Conclusion: Co-designing orchestration frameworks with underlying model capabilities can unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium models; CEPO provides a concrete, open pathway for broader adoption and research advancement.

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source
models to outperform models multiple times their size. We will open-source this
workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

### [239] [Agentic Metacognition: Designing a "Self-Aware" Low-Code Agent for Failure Prediction and Human Handoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19783)
*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a metacognitive monitoring layer for low-code/no-code autonomous agents that predicts failures and hands off to humans, improving task success and transparency but increasing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the non-deterministic failures of LCNC agents (loops, inaccurate outputs, unrecoverable errors) that erode reliability and user trust.

Method: Introduce an architectural pattern where a secondary metacognitive layer monitors the primary LCNC agent. It uses triggers (e.g., high latency, repetitive actions) to predict impending failures and proactively initiates a human handoff with a summary of the agent’s reasoning. A prototype is evaluated empirically.

Result: The approach increases overall task success rate but incurs notable computational overhead.

Conclusion: Human handoffs become a core design feature that enhances resilience, user experience, and trust through transparency, with discussion of ethical implications and future research directions.

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

### [240] [Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800)
*Donghwan Lee,Hyukjun Yang,Bum Geun Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transforms LP-based MDPs into unconstrained problems using a log-barrier, enabling gradient-descent solutions and aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for LP-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LP-based methods for MDPs are underutilized due to inequality constraints; a solid theoretical interpretation and practical solver is needed, with relevance to classical RL and offline RL.

Method: Apply a log-barrier transformation to the LP formulation of MDPs to convert it into an unconstrained optimization problem; solve approximately with gradient descent; provide theoretical interpretation of this approach.

Result: Proposes a unified theoretical framework and a practical gradient-descent-based approach for LP-based MDPs; shows how inequality constraints can be effectively handled via log-barrier reformulation.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between LP-based MDP theory and practice by offering a log-barrier reformulation and gradient-based solution, potentially broadening the appeal and applicability of LP methods in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

*Huizhen Shu,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATENTGUARD introduces a three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent-space control to enable safe, controllable, and interpretable responses in LLMs, with evidence across multiple model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the safety-utility trade-off and the challenge of achieving fine-grained, representation-level safety control that is interpretable and controllable.

Method: Stage 1: fine-tune an LLM on rationalized datasets with reasoning-enhanced refusals to adversarial prompts and benign responses for robust behavioral priors. Stage 2: train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP activations, supervised by multi-label annotations (attack types, attack methods, benign indicators) to learn disentangled, interpretable latent representations. Stage 3: manipulate learned latent dimensions to produce selective refusal, blocking harmful requests while preserving legitimate utility. Validation includes Qwen3-8B experiments showing safety controllability and interpretability gains, and cross-architecture validation on Mistral-7B showing generalizability.

Result: Significant improvements in safety controllability and response interpretability without sacrificing utility on Qwen3-8B; demonstrated generalizability to Mistral-7B via latent steering across model families.

Conclusion: Structured representation-level intervention via supervised latent control is a promising direction for safer yet practical LLM systems, enabling precise safety steering without compromising usefulness.

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

TL;DR: Hybrid privacy-preserving framework CON-QA enables secure QA over enterprise contracts by combining local and cloud LLMs with anonymization and reconstruction, validated on a CUAD-derived dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect sensitive contractual information (PII and confidential clauses) when using cloud LLMs for contract QA without sacrificing answer quality.

Method: Three-stage framework: (i) semantic query decomposition and local retrieval with a deployed LLM; (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive entities via a structured one-to-many mapping to prevent cross-session entity inference while preserving semantics; (iii) anonymized answer generation by a cloud LLM followed by local session-consistent reverse mapping to reconstruct the original answer.

Result: Empirical evaluations and human assessments show CON-QA preserves privacy and utility, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly mitigates privacy risks, validating its practicality for enterprise contract QA.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable hybrid LLM approach for secure enterprise contract QA, enabling privacy-preserving, high-quality answers; future work includes stronger threat modeling and broader deployment scenarios.

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Result: Provides a structured overview and taxonomy of embodied AI approaches, clarifies indispensable roles of LLMs/MLLMs and WM, advocates joint architecture for complex physical tasks, and highlights representative applications and research gaps.

Conclusion: A joint MLLM-WM embodied AI architecture is posited as essential for real-world, physics-consistent, end-to-end intelligent agents; the survey outlines a roadmap from unimodal to multimodal implementations and invites future work in theory, systems, and applications.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide
applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future
research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MACD proposes a multi-agent self-learning framework for LLM-assisted clinical diagnosis that accumulates reusable clinical knowledge via a pipeline of summarization, refinement, and application. It extends to a collaborative MACD-human workflow with evaluator and oversight. Evaluated on 4,390 real-world cases across seven diseases using open-source LLMs, showing notable diagnostic accuracy gains (up to 22.3% over baselines, up to 16% over physicians in subset) and improved performance with human collaboration (18.6% vs physicians-only). Self-learned knowledge exhibits cross-model stability, transferability, personalization, and provides traceable rationales, suggesting a scalable bridge between LLM knowledge and real-world practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prompting and single-agent inferences in medical diagnosis by enabling continual, reusable knowledge accumulation and collaborative reasoning across multiple agents, with a human-in-the-loop for disagreement, aiming to improve accuracy and explainability in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Introduce MACD as a pipeline where multiple LLM agents summarize, refine, and apply diagnostic insights to a given case. Extend to a MACD-human collaborative workflow with an evaluator agent and human oversight. Validate on 4,390 real-world patient cases spanning seven diseases using open-source LLMs (Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B). Compare against clinical guidelines and physicians, and assess cross-model stability and explainability through traceable rationales.

Result: MACD yields significant diagnostic accuracy gains (up to 22.3% over baselines) and, on data subsets, matches or exceeds physician performance (up to 16% improvement). The MACD-human setup reports an 18.6% improvement over physicians-only diagnosis. The self-learned knowledge demonstrates cross-model stability, transferability, and personalization, with traceable rationales for explainability.

Conclusion: MACD offers a scalable, self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis that aligns LLM-derived knowledge with real-world clinical practice, enhances explainability, and enables effective human-LMM collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy across diseases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

*Aymeric Vellinger,Nemanja Antonic,Elio Tuci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pheromone-led swarm foraging in C. elegans is shown to be equivalent to distributed reinforcement learning; stigmergy serves as external memory for collective credit assignment, with heterogeneity (explorers) needed to maintain plasticity in changing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncover a theoretical link between stigmergic signaling and reinforcement learning, and demonstrate how simple agents achieve adaptive collective decision-making, informing design of programmable living systems and swarm robotics.

Method: Theoretical modeling of pheromone dynamics in nematode swarms, mapping to cross-learning updates (RL). Validation against literature data for static foraging patterns; computational experiments in multi-armed bandit setups to test dynamics and the impact of exploratory agents on adaptability.

Result: Pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror cross-learning updates; static conditions reproduce empirical C. elegans foraging patterns; dynamic environments show persistent pheromone trails hinder adaptation; minority exploratory agents restore plasticity, enabling rapid task switching; behavioral heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation and can extinguish outdated strategies; stigmergy acts as distributed RL with environmental signals as external memory for credit assignment.

Conclusion: Stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes; bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics enables resilient decision-making in volatile environments and advances programmable living systems.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

### [246] [Steerable Adversarial Scenario Generation through Test-Time Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20102)
*Tong Nie,Yuewen Mei,Yihong Tang,Junlin He,Jie Sun,Haotian Shi,Wei Ma,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a steerable adversarial scenario generator for autonomous driving that lets users control the trade-off between adversariality and realism at inference time without retraining, via offline, data-efficient preference alignment and interpolation between two expert models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial scenario generators lock in a fixed trade-off between adversariality and realism, limiting flexibility for diverse safety testing and policy training. A tunable, efficient framework is needed to produce tailored scenarios on demand.

Method: Reframe generation as multi-objective preference alignment. Use hierarchical group-based preference optimization to decouple hard feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Fine-tune two experts on opposing preferences and at inference time interpolate their weights to obtain a continuum of policies, enabling steerable trade-offs without retraining. Grounded by linear mode connectivity.

Result: Experiments show SAGE achieves a superior balance of adversariality and realism compared to baselines and also improves closed-loop training of driving policies.

Conclusion: SAGE provides fine-grained, on-demand control over scenario steerability, combining offline preference alignment with inference-time interpolation to generate tailored, safe yet adversarial scenarios without retraining.

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired fidelity-based reward derived from PEPS is integrated into PPO to improve coherence of multi-step reasoning traces in LLMs, evaluated on GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank, showing improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lose coherence in multi-step or structured reasoning tasks. Existing approaches rely on supervised or contrastive objectives that may not enforce global consistency. The paper motivates using a fidelity-inspired signal from PEPS to enforce global coherence in reasoning traces.

Method: Introduce a fidelity-based reward computed via Projection Entangled Pair States (PEPS) and incorporate it into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The learning objective emphasizes structural consistency over local supervision, guiding generation toward coherent, globally consistent reasoning traces.

Result: Evaluated on diverse datasets (GSM8K, StrategyQA, EntailmentBank) with multiple coherence-related metrics. The quantum-inspired approach yields significant improvements over supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baselines in terms of reasoning trace coherence.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired fidelity provides a foundation to enhance the global coherence of reasoning traces in LLMs, offering a novel integration of physics-inspired concepts with reinforcement learning to improve structured, multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

TL;DR: FoA enables dynamic, capability-driven multi-agent orchestration using Versioned Capability Vectors, semantic routing over sharded HNSW indices, dynamic DAG-based task decomposition, and clustering, achieving scalable improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transform static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven collaboration to unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents and improve scalability for complex tasks.

Method: Three innovations: (1) semantic routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices with cost-biased optimization; (2) dynamic task decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks into DAGs via consensus-based merging; (3) smart clustering that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on MQTT publish-subscribe for scalable message passing, with hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.

Result: Empirical evaluation on HealthBench reports 13x improvements over single-model baselines, with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives and shows horizontal scalability with consistent performance.

Conclusion: Semantic orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents, enabling scalable, capability-driven coordination and collaboration.

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

TL;DR: Real-world hardware deployment for cooperative lane-change prediction reveals practical challenges; documents bottlenecks, reliability issues, and constraints to guide future pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap between simulation/dataset studies and real deployments by documenting practical challenges and lessons learned in mixed-traffic lane-change prediction.

Method: Deploy and test a cooperative lane-change prediction pipeline on real hardware in mixed traffic, observing and recording bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints to extract practical insights.

Result: Identified practical challenges, bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints; provided actionable lessons and guidance for future deployments.

Conclusion: Documenting real-world deployment experiences helps guide robust pipeline design for lane-change prediction and encourages attention to practical deployment considerations.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar
pipelines.

*Xingjian Kang,Linda Vorberg,Andreas Maier,Alexander Katzmann,Oliver Taubmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agent framework can assist CT scan protocol configuration by interpreting natural or structured requests to modify acquisition/reconstruction settings and post-processing, showing feasibility but facing API and ambiguity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address time-consuming CT protocol management and radiology workforce shortage; improve workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload.

Method: Use an LLM-based agent with in-context learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling to identify protocol elements, generate device-appropriate protocol definition files, and apply modifications.

Result: Systematic evaluation shows the agent can retrieve protocol components, generate device-compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests; feasible in principle.

Conclusion: This demonstrates a clear path toward LLM-based agents for CT protocol management, though limitations include lack of unified device API and handling of ambiguous/complex requests.

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.
