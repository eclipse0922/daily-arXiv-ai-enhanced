### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ESCA and SGClip, a CLIP-based, open-domain scene-graph generator trained via neurosymbolic learning on 87k+ videos; improves MLLMs in scene graph generation, action localization, and reduces perception errors, with open-source models surpassing proprietary baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language models rely on high-level vision-sound-text data and lack fine-grained pixel-to-text alignment; there is a need for structured spatial-temporal understanding to improve embodied agents' perception and action reasoning.

Method: Propose ESCA framework and SGClip model. Train SGClip on 87k+ open-domain videos using a neurosymbolic learning pipeline that combines model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs with structured reasoning. SGClip supports prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluate on scene-graph generation and action localization benchmarks across two embodied environments.

Result: SGClip achieves strong performance on scene-graph generation and action localization benchmarks; ESCA improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, attaining state-of-the-art results across two embodied environments; notably reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.

Conclusion: Structured spatial-temporal understanding via ESCA-SGClip can significantly advance embodied AI by providing richer scene representations and robust perception, with broad applicability and potential to reduce reliance on labeled data.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossRay3D: a sparse cross-modality detector with Ray-Aware and Class-Balanced supervision plus Ray positional encoding, achieving state-of-the-art nuScenes results with improved efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse cross-modality detectors save computation but often generate sub-optimal foreground token representations due to insufficient preservation of geometric structure and class distribution. Improving token quality is key to boosting performance and robustness.

Method: Introduce Sparse Selector (SS) featuring Ray-Aware Supervision (RAS) to preserve geometric information during training and Class-Balanced Supervision to reweight class semantics so tokens from small objects are retained. Add Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to align LiDAR and image distributions. Integrate these into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, CrossRay3D.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show CrossRay3D achieving 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS, while running 1.84x faster than leading methods, and demonstrating robustness when LiDAR or camera data are partially or completely missing.

Conclusion: The approach enhances token representation quality in sparse detectors, delivering state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency and modality robustness; Ray PE effectively bridges LiDAR-image distribution and the Sparse Selector enables better token sampling and foreground fidelity.

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline using street CCTV streams for multi-defect detection (potholes, cracks, leaks) via YOLO detectors and scene-aware summary generation with a vision language model, outputting structured JSON action plans for maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and streamline city infrastructure inspection to replace costly, hazardous manual checks and to provide actionable maintenance guidance across multiple defect types.

Method: Detect defects with YOLO-family detectors on CCTV streams; feed detections into a vision-language model to produce scene-aware, structured JSON maintenance plans (descriptions, tools, dimensions, repair steps, alerts); review related work on pothole/crack/leak detection; prototype design; evaluate on public datasets and CCTV clips.

Result: Demonstrates accurate multi-defect detection and coherent, actionable summaries; capable of generating structured maintenance plans suitable for deployment.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable framework for city-wide monitoring that integrates real-time defect detection with automated, structured maintenance planning, while noting challenges and scalability considerations.

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work introduces IAD-GPT, a multimodal LLM-based framework for industrial anomaly detection that combines an Abnormal Prompt Generator, Text-Guided Enhancer, and Multi-Mask Fusion to enable interactive descriptions and pixel-level anomaly understanding; achieves state-of-the-art results on MVTec-AD and VisA in self-supervised and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IAD methods traditionally lack multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptive capabilities (e.g., color, shape, types of anomalies). While large pretrained models offer strong perception, they do not fully exploit LLMs for anomaly detection tasks. This motivates integrating rich text semantics with both image-level and pixel-level information to enable expressive, interactive anomaly detection.

Method: Propose IAD-GPT, a paradigm based on Multimodal LLMs. Use Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to create detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These prompts activate detection and segmentation in a pretrained visual-language model like CLIP. Introduce Text-Guided Enhancer to route image features through normal/abnormal text prompts and dynamically select enhancement pathways, focusing MLLMs on relevant visual aspects. Design a Multi-Mask Fusion module to incorporate masks as expert knowledge for improved pixel-level anomaly perception. Evaluate on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets with self-supervised and few-shot settings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, demonstrating improved detection accuracy and pixel-level grounding. Code is released at the provided URL.

Conclusion: IAD-GPT demonstrates that coupling rich text semantics with image-level and pixel-level cues via specialized modules (APG, Text-Guided Enhancer, Multi-Mask Fusion) enables robust, interactive anomaly detection and richer descriptions, indicating strong potential for practical IAD applications.

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

*Mahta Khoobi,Marc Sebastian von der Stueck,Felix Barajas Ordonez,Anca-Maria Iancu,Eric Corban,Julia Nowak,Aleksandar Kargaliev,Valeria Perelygina,Anna-Sophie Schott,Daniel Pinto dos Santos,Christiane Kuhl,Daniel Truhn,Sven Nebelung,Robert Siepmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR) improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency over free-text and structured reporting in chest radiograph interpretation; SR guided gaze reduction of search effort, and AI-SR further reduced cognitive load and was preferred by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how different reporting modes (free-text, structured reporting, and AI-assisted structured reporting) affect radiologists' image analysis behavior, diagnostic performance, efficiency, and user experience, using eye-tracking and performance metrics.

Method: Prospective study (July–December 2024) with four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students). Each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and eye-tracking. Comparisons among free-text (FT), structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR). Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy against expert consensus (Cohen's kappa), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics (saccade counts, fixation duration), and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analyses used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests (significance P ≤ .01).

Result: Diagnostic accuracy (kappa): FT 0.58, SR 0.60, AI-SR 0.71 (P < .001 for AI-SR vs others). Reporting time: FT 88 ± 38 s; SR 37 ± 18 s; AI-SR 25 ± 9 s (P < .001). Eye-tracking: radiograph-field saccades – FT 205 ± 135, SR 123 ± 88, AI-SR 97 ± 58; total fixation duration in report field – FT 11 ± 5 s, SR 5 ± 3 s, AI-SR 4 ± 1 s (P < .001 each). Novice readers shifted gaze toward the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode.

Conclusion: SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Intersectional Fairness Evaluation Framework (IFEF) and Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA) to diagnose and mitigate intersectional biases in image classification; demonstrates improvements on Open Images V7.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intersectional biases arise from interactions of multiple attributes; imbalanced datasets lead to systematic errors; a replicable framework is needed to analyze and mitigate these biases.

Method: Develop IFEF by combining quantitative fairness metrics with interpretability tools to identify bias patterns; propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA) that adapts augmentation intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics; evaluate on Open Images V7 across five object classes; include statistical validation across multiple runs.

Result: BWA improves accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24 percentage points and reduces fairness metric disparities by 35%; results are statistically significant (p < 0.05) across independent runs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a replicable methodology for analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of data augmentation tailored to subgroup distributions; potential for generalization to other datasets and modalities.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A differentiable, convergent quantization framework for neural networks that supports log-scale (powers-of-two) quantization, enabling multi-bit (n-bit) quantization and near full-precision accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-18 after ~15 training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces compute and memory, but prior work is often non-differentiable, neglects activation quantization, or sacrifices accuracy. A differentiable approach with convergence guarantees and support for log-scale quantization can achieve higher accuracy with multi-bit representations and practical training efficiency.

Method: Propose a differentiable quantization function with proof of convergence to the optimal network. Learn log-quantized values of the form 2^n, enabling n-bit quantization. Use shift-based quantization for weights and activations. Train on ImageNet with ResNet-18, focusing on weight quantization and then joint weight/activation quantization.

Result: On ImageNet with ResNet-18, weight quantization alone yields <1% accuracy drop vs full precision in ~15 training epochs. For joint weight and activation quantization using shift quantization, results are competitive with state-of-the-art in 15 epochs, with slightly higher CPU instruction count during inference but without requiring higher-precision multiplications.

Conclusion: The approach delivers differentiability with convergence guarantees and supports multi-bit, powers-of-two quantization (including log-scale quantization). It achieves near-full-precision accuracy in a short training window and competitive results for both weight and activation quantization, with practical inference costs and no need for higher-precision multiplications.

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

### [8] [StripRFNet: A Strip Receptive Field and Shape-Aware Network for Road Damage Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16115)
*Jianhan Lin,Yuchu Qin,Shuai Gao,Yikang Rui,Jie Liu,Yanjie Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art road-damage detection, especially slender cracks, via three modules: Shape Perception with large separable kernel attention (LSKA), a Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) with large strip convolutions, and a Small-Scale Enhancement Module (SSEM) with high-res P2 features and dynamic upsampling; it delivers strong accuracy gains on the RDD2022 and CRDDC/ORDDC benchmarks with real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate road-damage detection is challenged by diverse damage shapes, slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and poor recognition of small damages, which impedes SDG 11 goals for sustainable urban development and safe, well-maintained infrastructure.

Method: StripRFNet decomposes detection into three modules: (1) Shape Perception Module (SPM) using large separable kernel attention (LSKA) to improve shape discrimination during multi-scale feature fusion; (2) Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) employing large strip convolutions and pooling to capture slender cracks; (3) Small-Scale Enhancement Module (SSEM) leveraging a high-resolution P2 feature map, a dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to boost small-object detection.

Result: On the RDD2022 Chinese subset, StripRFNet improves F1-score by 4.4 pp, mAP50 by 2.9 pp, and mAP50:95 by 3.4 pp over the baseline. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%, outperforming CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while maintaining competitive inference speed.

Conclusion: StripRFNet delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with real-time efficiency for road-damage detection, presenting a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable infrastructure management under SDG 11; future work may address broader generalization and more detailed efficiency metrics.

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

### [9] [ObjectTransforms for Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16118)
*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms uses per-object perturbations and diffusion-generated variants to quantify and reduce uncertainty in vision-based object detection, improving training robustness and providing an uncertainty signal at inference time that helps filter false positives and recover false negatives on NuImages 10K using YOLOv8.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based detectors suffer from data bias and distributional shifts, leading to unsafe decisions in autonomous driving. Quantifying and reducing predictive uncertainty is essential for safer perception.

Method: Training-time: apply color-space perturbations to individual objects and use diffusion models to generate diverse pedestrian instances. Inference-time: perturb detected objects and compute the variance of detection scores as predictive uncertainty, using this to filter false positives and potentially recover false negatives.

Result: Training shows notable accuracy gains and reduced uncertainty across all classes. Inference shows higher uncertainty for false positives than true positives, enabling effective filtering and PR-curve improvement.

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms offers a lightweight, effective mechanism to quantify and reduce uncertainty in vision-based perception during both training and inference.

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

### [11] [GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16136)
*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free appearance transfer method for 3D assets uses guided sampling with a pretrained rectified-flow diffusion model conditioned on image or text, achieving improved texture and geometry transfer without ground-truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring appearance to 3D assets is challenging when input and output geometry differ; direct application of 3D generative models often fails to produce appealing results. A training-free, guidance-driven approach can leverage existing diffusion models to bridge appearance with geometry.

Method: Incorporate a pretrained rectified-flow diffusion model conditioned on image or text. During sampling, periodically inject differentiable guidance losses. Two guidance types are explored: part-aware appearance losses and self-similarity losses. The method is training-free and generalizable to other diffusion models and guidance functions.

Result: The approach transfers texture and geometric details to the 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. Traditional metrics are inadequate for this task due to sensitivity to local details and lack of ground truth; evaluation relies on GPT-based ranking and user studies for robustness and human-like assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed guidance-based sampling strategy is general and extensible to different diffusion models and guidance functions, enabling robust appearance transfer to 3D assets even when geometry differs significantly.

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

*Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Hoang-Thien Nguyen,Vi Vu,Ba-Thinh Lam,Phat Huynh,Tianyang Wang,Xingjian Li,Ulas Bagci,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch, asynchronously optimized semi-supervised framework (DuetMatch) improves robustness and accuracy in MRI segmentation by decoupling encoder/decoder optimization, introducing cross-branch regularization, and leveraging guided pseudo-label exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging suffers from limited annotated data. Semi-supervised learning with teacher-student setups helps, but jointly optimizing the whole network can hinder convergence and stability, especially with noisy supervision.

Method: DuetMatch uses two branches that alternately optimize the encoder or decoder while freezing the other (asynchronous optimization). It adds Decoupled Dropout Perturbation for cross-branch regularization, Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance to exchange pseudo-labels via augmented input pairs to increase model diversity, and Consistency Matching to refine noisy pseudo-labels with stable predictions from frozen teachers.

Result: Extensive experiments on brain MRI benchmarks (ISLES2022 and BraTS) show DuetMatch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods, demonstrating strong accuracy and robustness across diverse semi-supervised scenarios.

Conclusion: DuetMatch offers a robust and effective approach to medical image segmentation under limited labels by decoupling optimization, enforcing cross-branch regularization, and leveraging cross-guidance and label refinement to mitigate noisy pseudo-labels.

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autonomously navigates a C-arm to predefined anatomical landmarks from X-ray input using 3D displacement predictions with uncertainty estimation and calibrated 3D confidence regions; validated on synthetic data; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce radiation exposure and procedural delays by automating C-arm alignment in fluoroscopy-guided interventions; enables safe, reliable autonomous C-arm guidance.

Method: From an input X-ray image, predict 3D displacement vectors toward each target landmark. Model captures both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty and calibrates them with conformal prediction to produce 3D confidence regions around landmark locations. Training uses a probabilistic loss with skeletal pose regularization to enforce anatomically plausible outputs. Evaluation is conducted on a synthetic X-ray dataset derived from DeepDRR across multiple architectures.

Result: Strong localization accuracy across architectures and well-calibrated prediction bounds thanks to conformal calibration; demonstrates potential as a safe component for autonomous C-arm systems.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of uncertainty-aware, calibrated autonomous C-arm navigation from X-ray images in a synthetic setting, moving toward safer, more reliable automated fluoroscopy-guided interventions; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: A formula to estimate cost savings from an automatic IQA pre-filter in generative-image pipelines, applied to background inpainting, achieving 51.61% cost savings with AutoML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the manual IQA workload and costs due to low pass-yield in generated images, bridging the gap to traditional photography quality.

Method: Derive a general cost-savings formula as a function of an IQA engine's precision and pass yield; validate via a use case in background inpainting using a simple AutoML-based pre-filter.

Result: The proposed pre-filter framework yields substantial cost savings, quantified as 51.61% in the stated use case.

Conclusion: Automatic IQA pre-filtering is an effective approach to cut QA costs in generative-image pipelines, with a tunable trade-off via precision and pass-yield parameters; AutoML can provide a practical implementation.

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: fMRI-to-image reconstruction benefits from using a structured text latent space; the brain's activity aligns more with text representations than vision or joint spaces; PRISM uses object-centric diffusion and attribute-relationship search to compose images from structured text, achieving up to 8% perceptual loss reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to identify the latent space that best aligns neural activity with image generation and to improve brain-to-image reconstruction by leveraging compositional, structured representations.

Method: evaluate latent spaces (text, vision, joint) for fMRI-to-image reconstruction; adapt text representations and generative models to capture compositional aspects; propose PRISM with an object-centric diffusion module and an attribute-relationship search module; test on real-world datasets; compare against baselines and measure perceptual loss.

Result: fMRI signals are more similar to text representations than to vision or joint spaces; PRISM outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Structured text serves as an effective intermediate space bridging fMRI signals and image reconstruction; incorporating compositional representations of objects, attributes, and relations improves reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical remote sensing faces high cloud cover, diverse crop calendars, and scarce annotated data; labeling costs and data variability hinder model generalization. A data-centric approach aims to improve robustness and scalability by focusing on data quality over model-centric tweaks.

Method: A literature review and tutorial that surveys data-centric techniques (confident learning, core-set selection, data augmentation, active learning) across 25 strategies, assesses their readiness for large-scale tropical mapping, and proposes a practical 9-method pipeline for curating and training AI models in tropical agriculture.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated
costs of labeling, data variability, and regional generalisation. This paper

robustness and scalability. It reviews and prioritizes techniques such as
confident learning, core-set selection, data augmentation, and active learning.
The paper highlights the readiness and suitability of 25 distinct strategies in
large-scale agricultural mapping pipelines. The tropical context is of high
interest, since high cloudiness, diverse crop calendars, and limited datasets
limit traditional model-centric approaches. This tutorial outlines practical

### [18] [StretchySnake: Flexible SSM Training Unlocks Action Recognition Across Spatio-Temporal Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16209)
*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StretchySnake is a flexible-spatio-temporal training method for state space models (SSMs) in video action recognition, enabling scale-agnostic performance by training on varying resolutions and interpolating weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSMs offer linear scalability and recursion ideal for long sequences, but video training is tied to fixed spatio-temporal resolutions, hurting performance when evaluated on unseen scales; flexibility is needed to retain accuracy across short and long videos.

Method: Train SSMs with sampling of videos at varying temporal and spatial resolutions and dynamically interpolate model weights to match the current scale; compare five flexible-training variants to identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs.

Result: On short-action benchmarks (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action benchmarks (COIN, Breakfast), StretchySnake surpasses transformer and SSM baselines by up to 28% and shows strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). It provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more robust and resolution-agnostic.

Conclusion: Flexible, scale-aware training can substantially improve video SSM performance across a range of action recognition tasks, making SSMs a more practical choice for diverse video data.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel heterogeneous ensemble VM-BeautyNet combines a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model for facial beauty prediction, achieving state-of-the-art metrics on SCUT-FBP5500 with interpretable Grad-CAM analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FBP is subjective and challenging; CNNs struggle with global holistic cues. Vision Transformers capture global structure but have quadratic complexity; a linear, efficient long-range model (Mamba/SSM) can complement ViT by focusing on sequential features and textures. A fused architecture could leverage both strengths.

Method: A heterogeneous ensemble architecture that fuses a Vision Transformer backbone with a Mamba-based Vision model (State-Space Models). The ViT captures global structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone models long-range dependencies efficiently with linear complexity, targeting sequential features and textures. Grad-CAM visualizations are used for interpretability to confirm complementary feature extraction.

Result: Evaluated on SCUT-FBP5500, VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with Pearson Correlation 0.9212, MAE 0.2085, and RMSE 0.2698. Grad-CAM analysis supports the complementary features from the two backbones.

Conclusion: The study presents a new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics by integrating ViT and SSM-based backbones in a heterogeneous ensemble, achieving superior performance and offering interpretable insights into decision-making.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based detection of Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) using image data and hardware-assisted capture; accuracy improves with higher image resolution following a logarithmic trend, with diminishing returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of OCSCC is challenging due to subtle early signs and hidden areas; applying CNNs for precise image segmentation and pattern recognition, combined with hardware to capture and process high-quality images, could enhance early diagnosis.

Method: Train a CNN on 4293 training images (benign, malignant tumors, and negatives); evaluate using precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP); test on a dataset with images at five resolutions; develop enhancement hardware to capture detailed images; provide an open-access application for testing.

Result: Increasing image resolution leads to higher prediction accuracy on a logarithmic scale, with diminishing returns at higher pixel counts; standard metrics (precision, recall, mAP) were used to assess performance.

Conclusion: CNN-based detection of OCSCC with hardware-assisted image capture shows promise for early detection; optimal image resolution balances accuracy gains against data and processing costs; the project includes an open-access testing app to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Motivation: Address the ambiguities of static object-level reconstruction by leveraging dynamic cues from human interactions to enable real-time, robust dynamic scene understanding.

Method: An online framework that observes intentional human–object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the environment, jointly optimizing camera/object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and live map updates, with Gaussian splatting driving photorealistic rendering in dynamic scenes.

Result: Validated in multiple real-world scenarios with promising advantages, demonstrating accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling and efficient rendering.

Conclusion: Proactive interaction-driven scene decomposition and reconstruction offers a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional object-level reconstruction for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic

TL;DR: Cerberus introduces a two-stage cascaded VAD system combining offline normal behavior rule learning with online lightweight filtering and motion-aware VLM reasoning to achieve real-time VAD with high FPS and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer strong zero-shot detection but are computationally expensive and can have unstable grounding, hindering real-time deployment. There is a need for a fast, accurate VAD approach.

Method: A two-stage cascade: offline learning of normal behavioral rules to model norms; online inference using lightweight filtering plus motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection to focus VLM reasoning on relevant regions.

Result: On four datasets, Cerberus achieves 57.68 FPS on an NVIDIA L40S, a 151.79x speedup, and 97.2% accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods.

Conclusion: Cerberus provides a practical real-time VAD solution with a favorable efficiency–accuracy trade-off, enabling deployment in real-time video analytics.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A controlled, unbiased 6,000-image benchmark (OpenLVLM-MIA) for membership inference attacks on LVLMs shows prior high attack success was due to data biases; under unbiased conditions, MIA performance is near random chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in evaluating membership inference attacks on large vision-language models and provide a fair, ground-truth benchmark to properly assess privacy risk and drive development of robust privacy-preserving techniques.

Method: Constructed OpenLVLM-MIA with 6,000 images, carefully balancing member and non-member distributions and providing ground-truth membership labels across three training stages; evaluated state-of-the-art MIAs on this unbiased benchmark.

Result: State-of-the-art MIA methods' performance converges to random chance under unbiased conditions, indicating prior results were inflated by data distribution biases.

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the limitations of current MIA research on LVLMs and offers a transparent benchmark to spur development of stronger privacy-preserving methods.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are

### [25] [Stroke2Sketch: Harnessing Stroke Attributes for Training-Free Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16319)
*Rui Yang,Huining Li,Yiyi Long,Xiaojun Wu,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stroke2Sketch is a training-free framework that uses cross-image stroke attention to transfer reference stroke attributes to content sketches while preserving structure, enhanced by adaptive contrast and semantic-focused attention, achieving expressive, coherent sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to precisely transfer stroke attributes (thickness, deformation, sparsity) from reference styles to content sketches without sacrificing semantic content, and traditional methods often require training or extensive data.

Method: A training-free pipeline Stroke2Sketch introducing cross-image stroke attention embedded in self-attention to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences for accurate stroke transfer, plus adaptive contrast enhancement and semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground emphasis.

Result: Generates stylistically faithful sketches closely resembling handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in expressive stroke control and semantic coherence; code available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Stroke2Sketch offers an effective training-free solution for style-guided sketch generation with precise stroke transfer and content preservation, demonstrating strong expressive and semantic fidelity and potential for real-time or broad applicability.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

### [26] [Scaling Laws for Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16320)
*Wenhao Wang,Longqi Cai,Taihong Xiao,Yuxiao Wang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shows power-law scaling in deepfake detection performance with data/diversity and multiple methods; introduces ScaleDF and provides forecasting and data-centric insights, plus effects of pre-training/augmentation and scaling limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets in deepfake detection and investigates whether scaling laws govern detection performance, to forecast requirements and guide data-centric defense.

Method: Construct ScaleDF with over 5.8 million real images from 51 domains and over 8.8 million fake images from 102 deepfake methods; analyze model performance as a function of the number of real domains, number of deepfake methods, and training images; examine pre-training and data augmentation effects under scaling; discuss limitations of scaling.

Result: Detected a power-law decay in detection error as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake methods increases; ScaleDF enables forecasting the data needed to reach target performance; findings include the influence of pre-training and data augmentation under scaling and the identification of scaling limits for deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Scaling laws similar to those in large language models apply to deepfake detection; data-centric strategies and scalable data curation are essential to counter evolving deepfake technology, but scaling has inherent limits that necessitate complementary approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

### [27] [Scale-DiT: Ultra-High-Resolution Image Generation with Hierarchical Local Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16325)
*Yuyao Zhang,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model (Scale-DiT) enables ultra-high-resolution (4K×4K) image synthesis using hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, delivering faster inference and lower memory usage without native high-res training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambitious resolution demands in text-to-image generation by reducing attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear and by leveraging global semantics from low-resolution guidance, circumventing the need for expensive 4K training data.

Method: Divide high-res latents into fixed-size local windows for near-linear attention; inject global semantics via a low-res latent with scaled positional anchors; use a lightweight LoRA to bridge global/local pathways; repermute tokens in Hilbert curve order; apply a fused-kernel to skip masked operations for efficiency.

Result: Achieves more than 2× faster inference and lower memory usage than dense attention baselines; scales to 4K×4K without additional high-res training data; on FID/IS/CLIP and qualitative metrics, delivers better global coherence and sharper local detail, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods requiring native 4K training.

Conclusion: Hierarchical local attention guided by low-resolution anchors is a promising approach for efficient and coherent ultra-high-resolution image generation, enabling scalable 4K diffusion without extra high-res training data.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

### [28] [DiffusionX: Efficient Edge-Cloud Collaborative Image Generation with Multi-Round Prompt Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16326)
*Yi Wei,Shunpu Tang,Liang Zhao,Qiangian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionX enables cloud–edge collaboration for prompt-based diffusion image generation, using a lightweight on-device model for previews and a cloud model for final refinements, guided by a noise level predictor to balance latency and cloud workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models offer high-quality image generation but are computationally expensive, causing latency during multi-round prompt refinement and heavy cloud resource usage.

Method: Propose a cloud–edge framework (DiffusionX) where an on-device lightweight diffusion model rapidly produces previews, while a high-capacity cloud model performs final refinements after the prompt is finalized. Introduce a noise level predictor that dynamically balances computation between device and cloud to optimize the latency–cloud workload trade-off.

Result: DiffusionX reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5, while maintaining comparable image quality; it is only 0.9% slower than Tiny-SD but yields significantly improved image quality, demonstrating efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: A cloud–edge collaborative approach with adaptive noise-level balancing can deliver faster prompt-based diffusion generation without sacrificing image quality, effectively reducing latency and cloud load in interactive settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

### [29] [TokenAR: Multiple Subject Generation via Autoregressive Token-level enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16332)
*Haiyue Sun,Qingdong He,Jinlong Peng,Peng Tang,Jiangning Zhang,Junwei Zhu,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenAR adds token-level enhancements to autoregressive image generators to handle multiple reference identities, using Token Index Embedding, Instruct Token Injection, and Identity-Token Disentanglement, plus the InstructAR dataset; it achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-reference generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive conditional image generation struggles to decouple and maintain distinct identities when multiple reference images are used; a robust identity-aware mechanism is needed to ensure distinct references are preserved while preserving background quality.

Method: Introduce TokenAR framework with three components: 1) Token Index Embedding to cluster tokens by reference identity; 2) Instruct Token Injection to inject detailed priors as visual features for reference tokens; 3) Identity-token Disentanglement (ITD) to enforce independent identity representations; train on new InstructAR dataset; open-source.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show TokenAR surpasses current SOTA on multi-reference generation tasks, with improved identity consistency and background reconstruction; dataset contains 28K training pairs with two reference subjects, prompts, and masked backgrounds.

Conclusion: Token-level enhancements in AR models substantially advance multi-reference image generation; release of InstructAR dataset and code will facilitate further research and evaluation.

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

### [30] [RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333)
*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-aligned post-training reshapes vision encoders in MLLMs, yielding stronger, more localized visual representations and enabling a cost-efficient path (PIVOT) to superior vision backbones that outperform larger, heavily pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding how the vision encoder in MLLMs is shaped by training; while focus has been on the LLM backbone, the vision frontend and its training (SFT vs RL) is under-explored, despite RL showing potential in vision-related tasks.

Method: Systematic experiments comparing SFT and RL across vision-centric tasks (ImageNet classification, segmentation, gradient visualization) and across MLLMs. Assess downstream performance (especially vision-heavy VQA). Propose and validate PIVOT (Preference-Instructed Vision Optimization) as a simple recipe to train vision encoders that improve MLLMs with far lower compute; integration into MLLMs and comparison against larger baselines; provide a project page.

Result: RL yields stronger and more precisely localized visual representations than SFT, improving the vision encoder’s impact in MLLMs. The PIVOT approach, when integrated, yields vision encoders that outperform larger and more heavily trained counterparts while requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining.

Conclusion: The training strategy of the vision encoder fundamentally reshapes MLLMs’ visual representations; RL is advantageous for vision-aware tasks. PIVOT offers an efficient, effective route to robust vision backbones, potentially redefining how we pretrain/align vision encoders for MLLMs.

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

### [31] [On the Provable Importance of Gradients for Language-Assisted Image Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16335)
*Bo Peng,Jie Lu,Guangquan Zhang,Zhen Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A gradient-based framework GradNorm for Language-assisted Image Clustering that filters semantically positive nouns using gradient magnitudes, with theoretical guarantees and state-of-the-art clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LaIC suffers from selecting relevant positive nouns from unlabeled text; existing CLIP-based filters lack theoretical grounding.

Method: Compute gradient magnitudes of cross-entropy between target distribution and softmax with respect to noun representations to measure positiveness; provide error bound on noun separability; show GradNorm subsumes existing filtering strategies as special cases.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of separability; GradNorm outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks; includes ablation demonstrating generalization and relation to prior methods.

Conclusion: GradNorm offers a principled, unified framework for filtering nouns in LaIC with strong theory and empirical performance; it subsumes prior methods and advances clustering quality.

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MIRAD, a distributed, highly variable dataset for anomaly detection in social manufacturing, and shows existing SOTA methods underperform on it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality control for mass customization in distributed manufacturing is hard due to product variety, small batches, and imaging heterogeneity; existing datasets and algorithms are not representative of real-world social manufacturing.

Method: Create MIRAD capturing diverse individualized products across six geographically dispersed nodes with varying imaging conditions; benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods (one-class, multi-class, zero-shot) on MIRAD; analyze cross-node and cross-condition performance.

Result: All evaluated anomaly detection models exhibit significant performance drops on MIRAD compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting unresolved complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production.

Conclusion: MIRAD provides a realistic benchmark bridging industry requirements and academic research, enabling robust quality-control solutions for Industry 5.0; the dataset is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Dataset and annotations are made available via a Google Form link.

Result: Benchmarks indicate the dataset supports core surgical AI tasks and that the domain adaptation baseline reveals cross-center transfer characteristics; the resource provides a practical, diverse testbed for future models and methods.

Conclusion: This dataset addresses a critical gap in cataract surgery AI resources by offering a large, diverse, multi-annotated repository that can foster generalizable models and cross-center evaluation, with potential for expanded centers and annotation depth in future work.

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a
range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation
layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a

on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out
center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form

particularly on India's diverse and under-maintained road networks. This paper
presents iWatchRoadv2, a fully automated end-to-end platform for real-time
pothole detection, GPS-based geotagging, and dynamic road health visualization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric models are rich for humans/animals but lack expressive, flexible models for plants. A compact learned representation is needed to capture plant morphology and enable tasks in 3D reconstruction, generation, understanding, and simulation.

Method: Demeter is a data-driven parametric model that encodes topology, shape, articulation, and deformation. It handles varying topology across species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation, subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. The authors collected a large-scale, ground-truthed soybean dataset as a testbed and evaluate Demeter on synthesis, reconstruction, and biophysical simulation. Code and data are provided.

Result: Demeter effectively synthesizes plant shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes."

Conclusion: Demeter advances crop plant modeling by providing a compact, flexible learned representation that captures topology, articulation, and deformation, along with a dataset and code to support further research.

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edge-friendly hand pose estimation framework that combines sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone, a novel SPLite decoder, and quantization-aware training to boost efficiency on AR/VR edge devices while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time hand pose estimation on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5) for AR/VR applications, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: Use sparse convolution on ResNet-18 to exploit sparsity in hand pose images; introduce SPLite decoder to accelerate decoding; apply quantization-aware training to reduce memory and keep accuracy; evaluate on edge hardware (Raspberry Pi 5) and benchmarks (FreiHAND) with compound datasets.

Result: End-to-end efficiency up to 42% with sparse conv; SPLite decoder yields 3.1x faster decoding on Raspberry Pi 5; overall 2.98x speed-up on Pi 5 CPU; quantization preserves accuracy with PA-MPJPE only 0.1 mm worse on FreiHAND; comparable accuracy to SOTA with significantly improved efficiency.

Conclusion: A lightweight, edge-optimized framework for hand pose estimation achieves substantial speedups and memory savings while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling real-time AR/VR experiences on low-power devices.

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on

### [37] [REALM: An MLLM-Agent Framework for Open World 3D Reasoning Segmentation and Editing on Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16410)
*Changyue Shi,Minghao Chen,Yiping Mao,Chuxiao Yang,Xinyuan Hu,Jiajun Ding,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALM introduces an MLLM-agent framework for open-world, instruction-based 3D segmentation using Gaussian Splatting, leveraging a Global-to-Local strategy to achieve robust 3D masks without extensive 3D-specific post-training, and validates on LERF, 3D-OVS, and a new REALM3D benchmark with practical 3D manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between 2D vision-language reasoning and 3D spatial understanding, enabling accurate segmentation from complex or reasoning-based instructions without heavy 3D-specific fine-tuning.

Method: Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding: render multiple global views for coarse localization via an MLLM in parallel, then synthesize close-up views for fine-grained segmentation. Operates directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, using photorealistic renderings to aid MLLM comprehension. Supports open-world instruction grounding and downstream 3D interaction tasks (removal, replacement, style transfer).

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in interpreting explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and the authors’ REALM3D benchmark; shows practical utility for 3D manipulation tasks.

Conclusion:  REALM provides a practical, versatile 3D segmentation framework that leverages LLMs for open-world reasoning without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training, with broad potential for 3D understanding and manipulation.

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

*Xiaojun Guo,Runyu Zhou,Yifei Wang,Qi Zhang,Chenheng Zhang,Stefanie Jegelka,Xiaohan Wang,Jiajun Chai,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSL4RL converts self-supervised learning objectives into dense, verifiable rewards for RL fine-tuning of vision-language and multimodal models. It yields substantial gains on vision-centric and vision-language benchmarks, and demonstrates generality to graphs, with design principles for task selection and domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on linguistic priors and unreliable AI evaluators in vision-language models, by providing scalable, verifiable reward signals for RL from self-supervised objectives.

Method: Reformulate SSL tasks (e.g., image rotation prediction, masked patch reconstruction) into dense reward signals and use RL-based fine-tuning. Evaluate on vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks, plus systematic ablations on task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment. Demonstrate generality by applying the framework to graph learning.

Result: Substantial improvements on the targeted benchmarks; ablations reveal key factors influencing effectiveness (task difficulty, scale, semantic alignment); significant gains also observed in graph learning settings.

Conclusion: SSL4RL offers a versatile, verifiable self-supervised paradigm for aligning multimodal models via RL, with actionable design principles for selecting SSL tasks and aligning them with the target domain.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

### [39] [LightGlueStick: a Fast and Robust Glue for Joint Point-Line Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16438)
*Aidyn Ubingazhibov,Rémi Pautrat,Iago Suárez,Shaohui Liu,Marc Pollefeys,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightGlueStick is a lightweight GNN-based matcher that jointly matches points and line segments using Attentional Line Message Passing, achieving state-of-the-art results while enabling real-time edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lines and points provide complementary cues for SLAM/SfM. Traditionally they are matched separately, and although GlueStick introduced a joint point-line matcher, its heavy architecture hindered real-time or edge deployment. There is a need for an efficient, shared matcher that preserves line connectivity for robust performance.

Method: Introduces Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP) to explicitly expose line connectivity and enable efficient inter-node communication, integrated into a lightweight LightGlueStick architecture for joint point-line matching (extending GlueStick).

Result: Experiments show LightGlueStick achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks for joint point-line matching, while being lightweight enough for real-time or edge applications; code is released.

Conclusion: LightGlueStick provides an efficient, accurate joint matcher for points and lines suitable for SLAM/SfM pipelines and real-time deployment, with code available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

### [40] [EDVD-LLaMA: Explainable Deepfake Video Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16442)
*Haoran Sun,Chen Cai,Huiping Zhuang,Kong Aik Lee,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EDVD-LLaMA, an explainable deepfake video detection framework that uses spatio-temporal tokenization and a fine-grained multimodal chain-of-thought to produce accurate detections with verifiable explanations, plus a new ER-FF++ benchmark for dual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors lack transparency and robust generalization to new forgery methods. There is a need for detectors that not only identify forged content but also provide traceable, trustworthy reasoning.

Method: 1) Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to fuse global/local cross-frame features for rich spatio-temporal inputs. 2) Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) that incorporates facial feature data as hard constraints during reasoning to achieve pixel-level localization and reduce hallucinations. 3) Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set) for dual supervision of reasoning and detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show EDVD-LLaMA achieves strong detection accuracy, improved explainability, and robustness across cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios, outperforming prior DVD methods.

Conclusion: EDVD-LLaMA offers a more explainable and superior solution for deepfake detection, with publicly available code and dataset to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Kunyu Peng,Di Wen,Jia Fu,Jiamin Wu,Kailun Yang,Junwei Zheng,Ruiping Liu,Yufan Chen,Yuqian Fu,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefAVA++ extends RefAVA to a large-scale dataset (>2.9M frames, >75.1k annotated persons) and introduces RefAtomNet++, a cross-modal framework with multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention and multi-trajectory Mamba modeling for RefRAVAR. It achieves state-of-the-art results, advancing precise language-guided atomic action understanding for a target person in multi-person scenes; code/dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RefRAVAR requires precise language-guided understanding of atomic actions for a specific person in multi-person settings. Prior models (e.g., RefAtomNet) exhibit limited cross-modal alignment and suboptimal localization/prediction, hindering fine-grained action recognition conditioned on natural language descriptions.

Method: Propose RefAtomNet++ featuring 1) multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention to aggregate spatial/temporal tokens across semantic levels; 2) multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels; 3) dynamic scanning trajectories by selecting nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for partial-keyword and scene-attribute; 4) enhanced cross-modal token aggregation across semantic hierarchies.

Result: Experiments show RefAtomNet++ achieves new state-of-the-art results on the RefAVA/RefAVA++-style tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RefAtomNet++ effectively improves cross-modal alignment and localization for RAVAR, supported by a large-scale dataset RefAVA++; code and dataset released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

### [42] [Enhancing Rotated Object Detection via Anisotropic Gaussian Bounding Box and Bhattacharyya Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16445)
*Chien Thai,Mai Xuan Trang,Huong Ninh,Hoang Hiep Ly,Anh Son Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a rotation-invariant loss for rotated object detection using Gaussian bounding boxes and Bhattacharyya distance, with anisotropic Gaussian representation to handle square-like shapes; improves mAP on rotated-object benchmarks when integrated into existing detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotated objects are common in aerial/remote sensing and autonomous driving. Axis-aligned detectors struggle to capture orientation variations, and isotropic Gaussian variance can misrepresent square-like shapes; a rotation-aware, probabilistic bounding-box model could improve detection robustness.

Method: Represent objects with Gaussian bounding boxes and use Bhattacharyya distance as the loss between predicted and ground-truth Gaussians to capture orientation and shape differences. Introduce anisotropic Gaussian representation to handle square-like objects. Integrate this rotation-invariant loss into state-of-the-art deep learning detectors for rotated object detection.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in mean Average Precision over existing rotated-object detection methods, demonstrating enhanced robustness to orientation and more accurate localization.

Conclusion: The proposed loss and Gaussian representation improve accuracy and robustness of rotated-object detectors, with potential to establish new benchmarks across applications requiring precise orientation-insensitive localization.

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

### [43] [VIPAMIN: Visual Prompt Initialization via Embedding Selection and Subspace Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16446)
*Jaekyun Park,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIPAMIN is a prompt initialization strategy for visual prompt tuning that aligns prompts with semantically informative regions in the embedding space and injects novel directions beyond the pretrained subspace, enabling strong adaptation of self-supervised vision backbones with minimal computation; it achieves state-of-the-art results across tasks and data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of pretrained networks for each downstream task is resource-intensive. Prompt tuning is lightweight but often fails to specialize prompts or expand representation space, especially with self-supervised backbones and in data-scarce settings. VIPAMIN aims to improve adaptation by better initializing prompts.

Method: VIPAMIN combines two components: (1) aligning prompts with semantically informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. The approach requires only a single forward pass and lightweight operations, making it computationally efficient while enhancing prompt effectiveness.

Result: VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and dataset sizes and sets a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning, despite its simplicity and low computational cost. The authors provide code at the given repository.

Conclusion: A simple yet effective prompt initialization strategy that improves adaptation of self-supervised vision models through targeted prompt alignment and expansion of the representational space, with broad applicability and low overhead.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

### [44] [Instance-Aware Pseudo-Labeling and Class-Focused Contrastive Learning for Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation of Electron Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16450)
*Shan Xiong,Jiabao Chen,Ye Wang,Jialin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised domain adaptation method for mitochondria instance segmentation in EM images using sparse target-domain point labels, combining multitask learning (segmentation + center detection) with cross-teaching, class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning, and an instance-aware pseudo-label selection for self-training to outperform UDA/WDA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High annotation cost for per-domain mitochondria segmentation and domain shifts between EM datasets; sparse point labels offer a cost-effective supervision signal for target domains.

Method: A multitask framework that jointly learns segmentation and center detection, enhanced by a cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive learning. It employs segmentation self-training with an instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL) selection strategy that relies on the detection task to ensure reliable and diverse pseudo-labels, while leveraging unlabeled regions.

Result: The method outperforms existing UDA and WDA methods on challenging datasets, significantly narrowing the gap to the supervised upper bound, and providing substantial improvements under the UDA setting compared to other UDA techniques.

Conclusion: Efficiently leverages sparse point annotations and unlabeled image regions to achieve strong cross-domain mitochondria instance segmentation performance, indicating the proposed multitask cross-teaching, contrastive learning, and IPL self-training framework effectively mitigates domain shifts with minimal annotation effort.

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

*Peiran Xu,Xicheng Gong,Yadong MU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a foresighted agent for goal-oriented VLN that learns future-oriented action values via Q-learning on unlabeled trajectories, combines them with instructions through a cross-modal encoder, and uses an A*-style search to better navigate to the goal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods primarily rely on historical information and myopically optimize actions, lacking consideration of long-term consequences. They aim to equip agents with foresight by leveraging large-scale unlabeled trajectories to learn layout and object-relations, enabling prediction of future information after actions.

Method: 1) Train a Q-model with Q-learning on unlabeled trajectory data to capture general indoor-layout/object-relations knowledge and generate a Q-feature for each candidate action. 2) Use a cross-modal future encoder to combine the Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce action scores reflecting future prospects. 3) Combine these scores with history-based scores and apply an A*-style search to explore regions likely to lead to the destination.

Result: Extensive experiments on widely used goal-oriented VLN datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Incorporating future-oriented Q-features and cross-modal fusion with an A*-style search improves goal-oriented VLN performance by guiding exploration toward actions with favorable long-term outcomes.

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*Haocheng Tang,Ruoke Yan,Xinhui Yin,Qi Zhang,Xinfeng Zhang,Siwei Ma,Wen Gao,Chuanmin Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGC-Avatar introduces a hierarchical Gaussian compression approach for streaming dynamic 3D avatars that separates structural and motion information, using a StyleUNet-based generator and SMPL-X, enabling progressive, layer-wise decoding with improved bitrate efficiency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods lack strong human priors, leading to suboptimal bitrate efficiency and reconstruction quality at the decoder, hindering streamable 3D avatar applications.

Method: Disentangle Gaussian representations into a structural layer that maps poses to Gaussians via a StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer that uses the SMPL-X model to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. Enables layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs (video, text). Incorporates a facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and expression under low-bitrate constraints.

Result: Experimental results show that HGC-Avatar is a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar rendering and significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and compression efficiency.

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar provides an efficient transmission and high-quality rendering framework for dynamic avatars, leveraging a hierarchical Gaussian representation with priors to improve streaming performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

*Lukas Selch,Yufang Hou,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,Rogerio Feris,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISMM-Bench introduces a real-world, reviewer-sourced multimodal inconsistency benchmark for scientific papers, with three tasks (inconsistency identification, remedy, pair matching) and JSON-based answer formats to reduce bias; evaluated across 21 LMMs showing substantial gaps in multimodal scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in evaluating LMMs on authentic multimodal inconsistencies in scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus on single modalities or synthetic errors and miss real-world complexity, undermining trust in automated scientific understanding.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline—review mining, LLM-assisted filtering, and human verification—curates 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. It defines three tasks (inconsistency identification, remedy, pair matching) and introduces structured JSON-based answers to curb choice-only shortcuts.

Result: Benchmark across 21 leading LMMs (open-weight and proprietary) shows low performance in the 26.1–54.2% range, highlighting substantial challenge in multimodal scientific reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains hard for current LMMs; the benchmark exposes gaps and motivates development of trustworthy scientific assistants and more robust evaluation methods.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

*Franko Šikić,Sven Lončarić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task, YOLOv8-based model (OOS-DSD) for out-of-stock detection that jointly detects OOS areas, segments products, and estimates scene depth using pseudo-labels; it surpasses state-of-the-art methods and key ablations confirm the benefits of auxiliary learning and depth normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate OOS detection is critical for retail shelf verification. Leveraging auxiliary tasks (segmentation and depth) and pseudo-labeled depth can improve robustness and performance, addressing limited labeled data for depth while exploiting rich visual cues.

Method: Extend YOLOv8 with parallel branches for OOS detection, product segmentation, and depth estimation. Train OOS and segmentation branches with ground-truth data, while depth estimation uses pseudo-labeled depth from Depth Anything V2. Apply a depth normalization procedure to stabilize training due to relative depth labels.

Result: The proposed method outperforms SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% mAP. Ablation studies show auxiliary learning boosts mAP by 3.7%, and depth normalization adds 4.2%.

Conclusion: Joint auxiliary learning across OOS detection, segmentation, and depth estimation with depth normalization yields improved OOS performance, highlighting the benefits of multi-task training and pseudo-labeled depth guidance.

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

### [49] [Image Categorization and Search via a GAT Autoencoder and Representative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16514)
*Duygu Sap,Martin Lotz,Connor Mattinson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rep-centric image categorization/retrieval using a GAT-based autoencoder on a similarity graph; builds image/category representatives to categorize queries and retrieve nearest match within the identified category; validated against standard features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage graph relationships and attention-driven embeddings to capture contextual features among images for improved categorization and retrieval.

Method: Construct a similarity graph with nodes as images or representatives; apply a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based autoencoder to learn context-aware latent embeddings; derive category representatives from embeddings; categorize a query by comparing its representative to category representatives; retrieve the most similar image within the identified category; compare against standard feature-based baselines; evaluate via experiments.

Result: Shows the representative-centric approach is effective; achieves competitive performance with standard feature-based techniques; demonstrates the utility of GAT-autoencoder for joint categorization and retrieval.

Conclusion: A representative-centric, graph-attention framework is a promising strategy for image categorization and retrieval, effectively combining graph structure with attention-driven embeddings.

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

### [50] [Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in CLIP via Reconstruction and Alignment of Text Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16540)
*Jihoon Kwon,Kyle Min,Jy-yong Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: READ-CLIP improves compositional reasoning by adding token-level reconstruction and sentence-level alignment objectives during fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art on five compositional benchmarks and boosting several CLIP variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard contrastive vision-language models tend to focus on individual words rather than relations, limiting compositional understanding. This gap arises because text encoders are optimized to align words with visual objects, not their relational structure or paraphrase consistency.

Method: Introduce READ (Reconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions) as two auxiliary objectives added to fine-tuning: (1) token-level reconstruction where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions from the embedding of the original caption; (2) sentence-level alignment that explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in embedding space. Applied to pre-trained CLIP to yield READ-CLIP; also beneficial when applied to NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP.

Result: READ-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, beating the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. The approach also improves existing CLIP variants (e.g., NegCLIP, FSC-CLIP). Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that reconstruction encourages capturing word relationships within captions, while alignment ensures stable representations for paraphrases with different wording.

Conclusion: The combination of token-level reconstruction and sentence-level alignment complements each other, with reconstruction focusing on word-level relationships inside captions and alignment ensuring paraphrase consistency, together yielding stronger compositional reasoning and transferability to other CLIP variants.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

### [51] [Watch Where You Move: Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation for Gait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16541)
*Binyuan Huang,Yongdong Luo,Xianda Guo,Xiawu Zheng,Zheng Zhu,Jiahui Pan,Chengju Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitRDAE uses region-aware dynamic aggregation and excitation to adaptively search temporal receptive fields and attend to dynamic gait regions, achieving state-of-the-art gait recognition under covariates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of fixed or uniform temporal scales on predefined regions in gait recognition, which hampers modeling regions that change dynamically and are affected by covariates.

Method: Two main modules: (1) Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) that dynamically learns the optimal temporal receptive field for each region; (2) Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) that emphasizes regions with stable motion patterns and suppresses static regions susceptible to covariates.

Result: GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark gait datasets.

Conclusion: Region-aware dynamic modeling with adaptive temporal scales and selective attention improves gait recognition, particularly under covariate influences.

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

### [52] [Self-Supervised Learning to Fly using Efficient Semantic Segmentation and Metric Depth Estimation for Low-Cost Autonomous UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16624)
*Sebastian Mocanu,Emil Slusanschi,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-only indoor UAV system uses semantic segmentation and monocular depth with adaptive scale to metric depth, enabling obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation without GPS/LiDAR; achieves 14.4 cm depth error, 100% success in tests, uses an SVM teacher to train a 1.6M-parameter U-Net; end-to-end learning yields 87.5% autonomous success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for reliable autonomous flight indoors without expensive sensors; monocular depth lacks metric scale; combine semantic understanding with depth to support planning; improve training efficiency via distillation.

Method: Combine semantic segmentation with monocular depth estimation; introduce an adaptive scale factor that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into metric distances using semantic ground plane detection and camera intrinsics; apply a knowledge-distillation framework where a color-based SVM teacher generates training data for a lightweight U-Net (1.6M parameters) for real-time semantic segmentation; optionally replace the SVM teacher with a state-of-the-art segmentation model for more complex environments; enable end-to-end learning to derive flight policies from demonstrations; validate across lab experiments, real-world tests, and digital-twin simulations.

Result: Mean distance error of 14.4 cm in metric depth estimation; 100% success across 30 real-world flight tests and 100 digital-twin tests; increased surveillance distance and reduced mission time; 87.5% autonomous mission success rate with end-to-end learned flight policies.

Conclusion: Advances practical vision-based drone navigation in structured indoor environments, demonstrating viable metric depth estimation and computational efficiency on resource-constrained platforms; potential for broader deployment with adaptable teachers/segmentation backbones; limitations likely include indoor-only testing, reliance on ground-plane cues, and generalization to highly dynamic or unstructured scenes.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

### [53] [Fit for Purpose? Deepfake Detection in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16556)
*Guangyu Lin,Li Lin,Christina P. Walker,Daniel S. Schiff,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-world political deepfake benchmark (Political Deepfakes Incident Database) shows existing detectors struggle to generalize to authentic political deepfakes; paid tools fare better than free models but all show limited robustness, especially for video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between lab-created deepfake datasets and real-world political deepfakes that influence public discourse; improve safeguards against misinformation.

Method: Systematically evaluate state-of-the-art deepfake detectors from academia, government, and industry on the Political Deepfakes Incident Database (real-world political deepfakes since 2018); compare paid vs free tools; test generalization to authentic deepfakes and robustness to simple manipulations, with emphasis on video data.

Result: Detectors from academia and government underperform on real-world political deepfakes. Paid detection tools generally outperform free models but still struggle to generalize to authentic political deepfakes and are vulnerable to simple manipulations, particularly in video.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks and data resources to improve effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

### [54] [Structured Interfaces for Automated Reasoning with 3D Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16643)
*Aaron Ray,Jacob Arkin,Harel Biggie,Chuchu Fan,Luca Carlone,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a retrieval-augmented grounding pipeline that uses a Cypher interface to a 3D scene graph (3DSG) stored in a graph database to ground natural language with LLMs; improves scalability and reduces token usage compared to encoding the full graph in the LLM context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect natural language to a robot's world representations at scale: conventional 3DSG-as-text within LLM prompts struggles with large graphs; need scalable grounding that leverages LLMs and 3DSGs.

Method: Store the 3DSG in a graph database; expose a Cypher-based query interface as a tool to the LLM; use Retrieval Augmented Generation to fetch task-relevant subgraphs; evaluate on instruction following and scene QA; compare with context-window and code-generation baselines; test across local and cloud models.

Result: Cypher interface scales significantly better for large, rich graphs; yields large improvements in grounded language tasks; reduces token footprint of scene graph content; demonstrated on both local and cloud models; video supplement.

Conclusion: A graph-query-based grounding workflow enables scalable, efficient grounding of natural language in large 3DSGs, addressing context-window limits and outperforming token-dense, fully encoded baselines.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

### [55] [SHIELD: Suppressing Hallucinations In LVLM Encoders via Bias and Vulnerability Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16596)
*Yiyang Huang,Liang Shi,Yitian Zhang,Yi Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD is a training-free framework to reduce object hallucinations in LVLMs by addressing biases in visual encoders through re-weighting visual tokens, adding noise-derived tokens, and adversarial-decoding with contrastive decoding; it shows improved hallucination mitigation across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks, with code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in large vision-language models persists due to biases and vulnerabilities rooted in visual encoders. Unlike previous work focusing on LLM components, this work traces hallucinations to visual encoders and proposes a training-free mitigation framework.

Method: SHIELD combines three strategies: (1) re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, (2) introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and (3) applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability, all without additional training.

Result: Experiments demonstrate reduced object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families, with strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, indicating broad applicability.

Conclusion: SHIELD is a training-free, broadly applicable approach to mitigating object hallucinations in LVLMs by addressing statistical/inherent biases and vulnerability in visual encoders, with code to be released.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

### [56] [VisionSelector: End-to-End Learnable Visual Token Compression for Efficient Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16598)
*Jiaying Zhu,Yurui Zhu,Xin Lu,Wenrui Yan,Dong Li,Kunlin Liu,Xueyang Fu,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector is a lightweight, decoupled token selector for multimodal LLMs that uses a differentiable Top-K and curriculum annealing to enable adaptive, end-to-end learnable token compression, achieving strong performance with 12.85M parameters and notable speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs suffer from computational and memory bottlenecks due to massive visual token counts from high-resolution or multi-image inputs. Heuristic token compression often discards critical information and introduces biases, such as attention sinks, leading to sharp performance drops at aggressive compression. A plug-and-play, end-to-end learnable approach can adapt to various budgets and preserve important tokens.

Method: VisionSelector is a scorer module decoupled from the MLLM backbone. It employs a differentiable Top-K selection mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection across arbitrary compression rates. The system is lightweight with 12.85M trainable parameters and is designed to be plug-and-play across backbones.

Result: Generalizes across various compression budgets and adaptively identifies critical tokens. It preserves 100% accuracy on MME with a 30% retention budget, outperforms prior methods by 12.14% at a 10% retention budget, and doubles prefill speed.

Conclusion: Reformulating token compression as an end-to-end learnable, lightweight decision process via VisionSelector yields robust, adaptive token selection for MLLMs, enabling efficient operation across compression budgets and avoiding biases inherent in heuristic approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Conclusion: This work fills a gap in resources for lychee harvesting robotics research by providing a robust, consistently annotated dataset and demonstrating its utility through model evaluation; public availability promotes further research.

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three

*Young-Jun Lee,Byung-Kwan Lee,Jianshu Zhang,Yechan Hwang,Byungsoo Ko,Han-Gyu Kim,Dongyu Yao,Xuankun Rong,Eojin Joo,Seung-Ho Han,Bowon Ko,Ho-Jin Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiVerse is a large, multi-turn benchmark for vision-language models, with 647 dialogues and 484 tasks drawn from 12 benchmarks, evaluated via a GPT-4o-based checklist across 37 aspects. Results show current models struggle in complex multi-turns (≈50% success), but full dialogue context benefits smaller models, offering a comprehensive landscape for multi-turn VLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g., MMDU, ConvBench) do not fully cover the breadth and depth of real-world multi-turn interactions. A scalable, diverse benchmark and a rigorous, checklist-based evaluation are needed to rigorously assess and drive progress in multi-turn VLM capabilities.

Method: Construct 647 dialogues (avg 4 turns) across 484 tasks from 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. Use a GPT-4o-based checklist evaluator spanning 37 aspects (perceptual accuracy, linguistic clarity, factual correctness, etc.). Evaluate 18 VLMs on MultiVerse, examining the impact of full context versus limited context.

Result: Even the strongest VLMs (e.g., GPT-4o as a benchmark reference) achieve about 50% success in complex multi-turn conversations. Providing full dialogue context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models, underscoring the value of in-context learning. MultiVerse covers broad topics including factual knowledge, perception, mathematics, and coding, and reveals the challenging nature of multi-turn reasoning for current systems.

Conclusion: MultiVerse offers a comprehensive landscape for evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities of VLMs. The benchmark highlights current limitations and the importance of context-rich conversations, motivating future advances in robust multi-turn VLMs and in-context learning strategies.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

### [61] [Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660)
*Yuntian Wang,Xilin Yang,Che-Yung Shen,Nir Pillar,Aydogan Ozcan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTAP is a universal, transferable adversarial perturbation crafted for pathology foundation models. A fixed, imperceptible noise pattern added to pathology images degrades feature representations, causing significant performance drops in downstream tasks across diverse models and unseen data distributions, including misclassification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal systemic vulnerabilities of pathology foundation models and establish a rigorous robustness benchmark, highlighting the need for defenses and adversarial training before deploying AI in pathology.

Method: Optimize a fixed, weak noise pattern (universal perturbation) via deep learning to disrupt feature representations across multiple pathology foundation models. The perturbation is designed to be independent of the training dataset and field-of-view, and transferable to external black-box models.

Result: The perturbation causes significant performance degradation across state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, with visually imperceptible input modifications, including misclassification in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: UTAP represents a broad, model- and dataset-agnostic threat to pathology foundation models, underscoring the need for defense strategies and potentially enabling adversarial training to improve safe, reliable deployment in pathology.

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HYDRA introduces a teacher–student framework for spectral reconstruction from RGB to hyperspectral images. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 18% accuracy boost and faster inference across hundreds of channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable spectral reconstruction (SR) from color images to hyperspectral images in unseen scenarios, addressing limitations of prior multi-scale attention methods that work only for very sparse spectra and scaling to sensors with hundreds of channels.

Method: HYD hybrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA): a teacher model captures latent hyperspectral data; a student model learns mappings from natural RGB images to the teacher's encoded domain, using a novel training strategy to enable high-quality spectral reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms previous SR models on all metrics with a notable 18% accuracy improvement and faster inference times across channel depths, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HYDRA effectively enables high-quality, generalizable spectral reconstruction from RGB images, addressing key limitations of prior SR models and offering strong accuracy and efficiency across modern hyperspectral sensors.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

### [63] [Pursuing Minimal Sufficiency in Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16688)
*Yejie Guo,Yunzhong Hou,Wufei Ma,Meng Tang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We present MSSR, a dual-agent framework that constructs a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of 3D perceptual information via a Perception Agent and a Reasoning Agent to ground language in 3D, achieving state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks with interpretable reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle to ground language in 3D due to 2D-centric pretraining and redundant 3D data; a compact, sufficient, and minimal set of information is needed to answer spatial queries while producing interpretable reasoning.

Method: Define MSS; use a Perception Agent to extract sufficient 3D info using a perception toolbox and a SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module for language-grounded directions; a Reasoning Agent iteratively refines to enforce minimality, pruning redundancy and requesting missing info in a closed loop until MSS is curated.

Result: Empirically, the approach yields improved accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art on two benchmarks; provides interpretable reasoning paths and potential high-quality training data for future models.

Conclusion: Explicitly pursuing sufficiency and minimality in 3D grounding improves VLM performance and interpretability; MSSR offers a flexible framework and release-ready code.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

TL;DR: SDPA++: Self-supervised OCT denoising via self-fusion pseudo-ground-truth and patch-aggregated ensemble training; improves image quality without clean references on VIP Cup data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining paired clean/noisy OCT images is hard due to speckle noise and clinical constraints; need unsupervised denoising capable of leveraging only noisy data.

Method: Generate pseudo-ground-truth using self-fusion and self-supervised denoising; train ensemble of denoisers with a patch-based aggregation scheme to enhance clarity.

Result: Quantitative gains in CNR, MSR, texture and edge preservation on real-world noisy OCT from VIP Cup; demonstrates potential for clinical utility without clean references.

Conclusion: SDPA++ provides a practical, self-supervised denoising framework for OCT that can improve diagnostic image quality when clean datasets are unavailable.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

### [65] [Connecting Domains and Contrasting Samples: A Ladder for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16704)
*Tianxin Wei,Yifan Chen,Xinrui He,Wenxuan Bao,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-Connecting Contrastive Learning (DCCL) for domain generalization (DG): strengthens intra-class connectivity across domains via aggressive data augmentation, cross-domain positives, and model anchoring with a generative transformation loss; outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on five DG benchmarks without domain supervision; code at provided URL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DG suffers from distribution shifts between training and testing. Although contrastive learning (CL) learns class-separated representations, applying CL directly can hurt DG due to insufficient intra-class connectivity across domains.

Method: Propose DCCL. Data-side: more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples to reinforce intra-class connectivity. Model-side: model anchoring to exploit intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations; supplement with a generative transformation loss to better align unseen test domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks show DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, even without domain supervision.

Conclusion: DCCL provides a practical paradigm to enhance DG by improving cross-domain intra-class connectivity through data augmentation and anchor-based modeling with a generative objective; code released.

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

TL;DR: One-step human motion prediction using consistency models (HumanCM) achieves diffusion-level accuracy with far fewer inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and latency of diffusion-based motion prediction while preserving motion coherence and long-range dependencies.

Method: Learn a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states in a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal embeddings, enabling single-step generation.

Result: On Human3.6M and HumanEva-I, HumanCM attains comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models, while reducing inference steps by up to 100x.

Conclusion: A practical and efficient alternative to multi-step diffusion for human motion prediction, with strong accuracy and significant speedups; broader evaluation could further establish generalization.

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCENECOT framework for grounded chain-of-thought in 3D scenes with SCENECOT-185K dataset, enabling interpretable step-by-step grounded QA and strong results on 3D scene reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grounded QA in 3D LLMs is underdeveloped due to incomplete understanding of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning; there is a need for interpretable, modular reasoning in 3D environments.

Method: Introduce SCENECOT, a grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes that decouples complex tasks into simpler problems and builds visual clues via multimodal expert modules; present SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT dataset with 185k high-quality instances.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse 3D scene reasoning benchmarks show strong performance and high grounding-QA coherence; this marks the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning.

Conclusion: The SCENECOT framework enables step-by-step, human-like reasoning in 3D scene understanding and has potential to extend to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

*Jianbiao Mei,Yu Yang,Xuemeng Yang,Licheng Wen,Jiajun Lv,Botian Shi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit residual world model (IR-WM) for vision-based autonomous driving focuses on current state and changes rather than full future scene reconstruction, using BEV as a temporal prior and an alignment module to reduce error accumulation; it improves planning by producing an implicit future state and achieves top performance on nuScenes for 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency of attempting to reconstruct full future scenes—especially static backgrounds—by concentrating modeling capacity on evolving dynamics, thus reducing redundant computation and improving planning accuracy.

Method: 1) Build a robust bird's-eye-view (BEV) of the current state from visual inputs. 2) Use the previous timestep's BEV as a temporal prior and predict only the residual changes conditioned on ego-vehicle actions and scene context. 3) Apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments to prevent error accumulation. 4) Explore forecasting-planning coupling schemes and evaluate the impact of implicit future state on planning.

Result: On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Conclusion: Focusing on the residual evolution of the world, with alignment corrections and coupling with planning, yields more efficient, accurate vision-based world models and state-of-the-art planning performance on nuScenes.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UKANFormer is a high-precision coral reef semantic segmentation model that uses a Global-Local Transformer to mitigate label noise under noisy supervision from Allen Coral Atlas, achieving strong IoU and pixel accuracy and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global coral maps from Allen Coral Atlas lack fine-grained boundary delineation and semantic coherence; label noise and scarce high-quality labels hinder scalable ecological monitoring.

Method: Extend UKAN architecture with a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans) block in the decoder to capture global semantic structure and local boundary details; train under noisy supervision from Allen Coral Atlas; evaluate on coral classes.

Result: IoU 67.00%, pixel accuracy 83.98%; outperforms conventional baselines under the same noisy labels; predictions align more with real boundaries than the noisy labels.

Conclusion: Architectural design can mitigate label noise, enabling high-precision, scalable mapping under imperfect supervision; UKANFormer offers a foundation for ecological monitoring with scarce reliable labels.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI relies on internal world models to perceive, predict, and plan actions by simulating future states. A unified framework and evaluation standards are needed to compare models, guide design, and drive progress, especially for long-horizon reasoning and real-time control.

Method: Formulates the problem setting and learning objectives for world models, introduces a three-axis taxonomy to categorize capabilities and representations, surveys existing data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video, provides quantitative comparisons of state-of-the-art models, and discusses open challenges. It also points to a curated bibliography hosted at a public repo.

Result: A structured framework and taxonomy for world models in embodied AI; comprehensive survey mapping data, metrics, and model performance; identification of practical challenges (data scarcity, physical-consistency metrics, real-time efficiency, long-horizon consistency); publicly available bibliography for further reading.

Conclusion: The work establishes a standardized lens to design, evaluate, and compare world models in embodied AI, highlights key research gaps, and offers directions for developing unified datasets, evaluation metrics, and scalable, real-time capable models.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Beam search on discrete visual autoregressive models substantially boosts text-to-image generation, with a 2B-parameter model outperforming a 12B diffusion model; the discrete token space enables pruning and computational reuse, indicating architecture design matters for inference-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether search-based inference can close the gap between autoregressive discrete models and diffusion models in image generation; test if the discrete token space and early pruning enable gains independent of scale.

Method: Apply beam search to a discrete visual autoregressive model for T2I generation; conduct systematic ablations on token discreteness, pruning strategies, and computation reuse; include a verifier analysis to compare speed versus reasoning capability; benchmark against diffusion models.

Result: Beam search substantially improves text-to-image generation; a 2B autoregressive model outperforms a 12B diffusion model across benchmarks; gains stem from the discrete token space enabling early pruning and reusable computation; verifier analysis reveals trade-offs between speed and reasoning.

Conclusion: Model architecture enabling effective search (discrete tokens with pruning and reuse) is crucial for inference-time optimization in visual generation; scale alone is insufficient, and search-based strategies can rival much larger diffusion models.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset of 1,302 artifact instances across 11 SR methods with crowdsourced prominence scores, plus a lightweight regressor that predicts per-pixel prominence heatmaps; it outperforms prior methods in detecting prominent artifacts and the dataset/code are released for prominence-aware SR evaluation and mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifact artifacts in generative image super-resolution vary in perceptual impact. Treating all artifacts as uniform defects is inadequate; measuring and mitigating perceptually prominent artifacts can improve perceived quality and evaluation.

Method: Compile a dataset of 1,302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR methods, each paired with crowdsourced prominence scores. Train a lightweight regressor to produce spatial prominence heatmaps from SR artifacts and evaluate against existing artifact-detection methods. Release dataset and code.

Result: The regressor outperforms existing methods at detecting prominent artifacts across the dataset.

Conclusion: Prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation is beneficial for SR; the dataset enables more nuanced assessment and the regressor provides actionable prominence maps to guide artifact reduction.

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaMaIR is a CNN-based image restoration framework with a large receptive field, using Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) and a Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), plus a Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss), achieving improved texture restoration and efficiency over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based restoration often struggles to recover fine textures due to limited receptive fields and insufficient channel-wise feature modeling; expanding receptive field and modeling long-range channel dependencies can better preserve textures and edges.

Method: Introduce GMWTConvs to expand receptive field and enrich texture features; propose MCAM to capture long-range dependencies among feature channels; add MTELoss to guide preservation of fine textures; validate with extensive experiments showing performance and efficiency gains.

Result: WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image restoration quality and computational efficiency according to extensive experiments.

Conclusion: A large-receptive-field framework combining wavelet-based convolutions, a channel-aware module, and a texture-focused loss effectively preserves and restores fine textures, offering a strong CNN-based approach for image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current region-based editing approaches edit parts of an image in isolation, relying on local cues and failing to consider how edits affect the overall scene. This leads to inconsistencies, artifacts, and loss of coherence across the image.

Method: A dual-level guidance framework. 1) Region-level representations are computed with full-image context and aligned to detailed region descriptions. 2) The entire image is matched to a scene-level description generated by a large vision–language model, providing explicit verbal references that guide both local modifications and global structure.

Result: Experiments show more coherent and instruction-aligned edits and improved harmony between local changes and the global image, with code released at the provided URL.

Conclusion: Incorporating global scene context via region-level and scene-level language guidance enables more precise, coherent, and instruction-consistent text-conditioned image edits, highlighting the importance of cross-scale alignment in vision–language editing.

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

*Mingzheng Zhang,Jinfeng Gao,Dan Xu,Jiangrui Yu,Yuhan Qiao,Lan Chen,Jin Tang,Xiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMRRG: a Mamba-network–based X-ray MRG framework that uses partial LoRA on a pre-trained SSM vision backbone and an LLM with a hybrid decoder for end-to-end report generation, achieving strong results on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the over-reliance on LLMs and simple fine-tuning in current MRG, underutilization of vision foundation models, and the limited exploration of non-Transformer backbones like Mamba for cross-attention in medical report generation.

Method: Patch-based X-ray processing; SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction; Partial LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning; an LLM with a hybrid decoder to generate reports; end-to-end training; three benchmark datasets; source code release.

Result: Partial LoRA yields optimal performance; extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies for X-ray MRG; strong end-to-end results.

Conclusion: EMRRG demonstrates that non-Transformer backbones like Mamba can be effectively fine-tuned for X-ray MRG using parameter-efficient methods, boosting cross-attention and report generation, with potential for broader adoption and future exploration.

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

*Junbo Li,Weimin Yuan,Yinuo Wang,Yue Zeng,Shihao Shu,Cai Meng,Xiangzhi Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS2POSE is a 6D pose estimation method using BA-inspired pose regression with differentiable rendering and lighting-adaptive 3DGS, improving accuracy on T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion, and LineMod.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current correspondence-based methods struggle with textureless objects and lighting changes; need a robust 6D pose estimator that leverages optimization and differentiable rendering.

Method: Pose regression inspired by Bundle Adjustment; employs Lie algebra to build a pose-differentiable rendering loop; iteratively optimizes pose by comparing input and rendered images; updates color parameters in 3DGS to adapt to illumination.

Result: Achieves accuracy gains of 1.4%, 2.8%, and 2.5% on T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion, and LineMod datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: Integrating BA-inspired optimization, differentiable rendering, and illumination-adaptive 3DGS yields improved robustness for 6D object pose estimation in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

### [77] [Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16781)
*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free video understanding via frozen VLM features, Kernel Temporal Segmentation, and density-based clustering to produce structured, multi-modal summaries without end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video models require costly supervised training; this work aims to leverage the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs to enable zero-shot, scalable video understanding.

Method: Convert video to a semantic feature trajectory using a frozen VLM encoder; apply Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) to partition the trajectory into semantically coherent event segments; perform unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring scenes; select representative keyframes from clusters; use the VLM to generate textual descriptions; assemble a structured, multi-modal video summary.

Result: The approach yields an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic zero-shot pipeline for video analysis, delivering automatic, structured summaries without task-specific training.

Conclusion: This training-free framework offers a scalable alternative to supervised video models, enabling zero-shot, interpretable structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

### [78] [Segmentation as A Plug-and-Play Capability for Frozen Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16785)
*Jiazhen Liu,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS is a plug-and-play head attached to a frozen MLLM that enables pixel-level segmentation by refining attention-derived cues into mask-decoder-ready features, achieving strong performance without finetuning the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation in Multimodal LLMs traditionally requires finetuning that alters the model's output space and degrades generalization; a unified model with segmentation should preserve generalization while adding new capabilities.

Method: Attach a lightweight trainable head to a frozen MLLM. Refine spatial cues in attention maps to extract keypoints, and describe them into point-wise features that are directly compatible with the mask decoder, avoiding changes to the MLLM's outputs.

Result: LENS delivers segmentation results that are competitive with or superior to retraining-based approaches while fully preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: LENS provides an efficient, attachable paradigm to extend MLLMs with segmentation, moving toward truly unified, multi-talented models.

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

*Sara Hatami Rostami,Behrooz Nasihatkon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised road segmentation using geometric priors and temporal consistency achieves 0.82 IoU on Cityscapes with a simple design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate dependence on costly manually labeled datasets for road segmentation by leveraging scene geometry and temporal cues to distinguish road from non-road.

Method: 1) Generate weak labels from geometric priors: mark pixels above the horizon as non-road and designate a front-of-vehicle quadrilateral as road. 2) Refine with temporal consistency by tracking local feature points across frames and penalizing label inconsistencies via mutual information maximization.

Result: IoU of 0.82 on Cityscapes, indicating high accuracy and temporal stability despite unsupervised setup.

Conclusion: Shows that combining geometric constraints and temporal consistency enables scalable, unsupervised road segmentation for autonomous driving, reducing labeling requirements while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

*Chengxuan Zhu,Shuchen Weng,Jiacong Fang,Peixuan Zhang,Si Li,Chao Xu,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based Personalized Image Filter (PIF) learns and transfers photographic style from reference images by modeling photographic concepts as generative priors and using textual inversion to adapt prompts, preserving content while styling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing style transfer methods that struggle to learn meaningful photographic concepts from references or preserve the content of the original image, enabling robust extraction and transfer of photographic style.

Method: Employs a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model. Uses a generative prior to learn the average appearance of photographic concepts and how to adjust them via text prompts. Learns the photographic style of reference images with textual inversion by optimizing prompts for the photographic concepts.

Result: Demonstrates outstanding performance in extracting and transferring diverse photographic styles, while preserving content. Evaluation is supported by a project page.

Conclusion: PIF offers a practical, content-preserving, and concept-aware approach to personalized photographic style transfer by leveraging diffusion priors and textual inversion.

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

*Yahia Battach,Abdulwahab Felemban,Faizan Farooq Khan,Yousef A. Radwan,Xiang Li,Fabio Marchese,Sara Beery,Burton H. Jones,Francesca Benzoni,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReefNet presents a large, globally-sourced coral reef image dataset with WoRMS-mapped genus labels, enabling cross-domain evaluation for domain-generalizable, fine-grained coral classification; results reveal strong within-source performance but poor cross-domain and zero-shot generalization, aiming to spur domain-adaptive monitoring and conservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coral reefs are declining under anthropogenic pressures (notably climate change); there is an urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. Existing datasets are often small, geographically limited, or provide coarse labels and are not readily ML-ready. A large, taxonomically mapped, global dataset can enable robust, domain-generalizable coral classification and monitoring.

Method: Assemble ~925,000 genus-level coral annotations from 76 CoralNet sources plus an Al Wajh Red Sea site, with expert-verified labels mapped to WoRMS. Propose two evaluation settings: (i) within-source benchmark with partitioned images per source for local evaluation; (ii) cross-source benchmark withholding entire sources to test domain generalization. Evaluate both supervised and zero-shot classification.


Result: Supervised within-source performance is promising, but performance drops sharply when evaluating across domains. Zero-shot models perform poorly overall, especially on rare and visually similar genera.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a challenging benchmark to drive advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. The authors plan to release the dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to support robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

### [82] [Robust Cross-Domain Adaptation in Texture Features Transferring for Wood Chip Moisture Content Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16832)
*Abdur Rahman,Mohammad Marufuzzaman,Jason Street,Haifeng Wang,Veera G. Gude,Randy Buchanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Five texture feature types from wood-chip images are combined to predict moisture content; the combined features achieve high accuracy (95%), and a domain adaptation method (AdaptMoist) improves cross-domain prediction by 23% (average 80% vs 57% for non-adapted). A mutual-information-based criterion guides model saving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, fast, and robust moisture content prediction across wood chips from diverse sources is critical for biofuel optimization, but existing methods suffer from variability in data distributions across sources.

Method: Extract five texture feature types from wood chip images and evaluate their predictive power for moisture content. Build a combined feature set that outperforms individual features. Develop AdaptMoist, a domain adaptation approach that transfers knowledge across data sources using texture features. Propose a model-saving criterion based on adjusted mutual information.

Result: The combined texture feature set achieves 95% accuracy. AdaptMoist improves cross-domain accuracy by 23%, yielding an average of 80% across domains, versus 57% for non-adapted models.

Conclusion: Texture-based features, when combined with a domain adaptation approach and a mutual-information-based model selection criterion, provide robust wood-chip moisture content predictions across varying sources, suggesting industrial potential.

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

### [83] [From Mannequin to Human: A Pose-Aware and Identity-Preserving Video Generation Framework for Lifelike Clothing Display](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16833)
*Xiangyu Mu,Dongliang Zhou,Jie Hou,Haijun Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based mannequin-to-human video generator, M2HVideo, achieves identity-preserving, photorealistic videos from mannequin footage by addressing head–body misalignment, identity drift, and texture fidelity using a dynamic head encoder, pixel-space mirror loss with DDIM, and a distribution-aware adapter; validated on multiple datasets with superior clothing consistency, identity preservation, and fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mannequin-based displays are cost-effective but lack realism. The task requires converting mannequin footage into identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos, while preserving consistent identity and clothing details across frames.

Method: M2HVideo uses a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial semantics with body pose to produce stable identity embeddings, a pixel-space mirror loss via DDIM-based one-step denoising to recover facial details lost in latent compression, and a distribution-aware adapter to align identity and clothing feature distributions for better temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, ASOS dataset, and MannequinVideos show M2HVideo achieves superior clothing consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: M2HVideo effectively enables identity-controllable, photorealistic mannequin-to-human video generation and mitigates head–body misalignment and identity drift, with strong generalization across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Haofan Ren,Qingsong Yan,Ming Lu,Rongfeng Lu,Zunjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS-R) approach improves rendering quality while preserving geometric accuracy with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to jointly optimize geometry and rendering; 2DGS offers good rendering but compromises geometry. A training strategy that enhances rendering without sacrificing geometric fidelity is needed.

Method: 2DGS-R uses a three-stage training pipeline: (1) train the base 2D Gaussians with normal consistency regularization; (2) identify Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and apply an in-place cloning operation to enhance them; (3) fine-tune the model with opacity frozen.

Result: Compared to the original 2DGS, 2DGS-R achieves higher rendering quality with only about 1% extra storage and negligible extra training time, while preserving fine geometric structures.

Conclusion: A hierarchical training approach can balance rendering quality and geometric accuracy efficiently, suggesting that incremental improvements to components can yield overall performance gains without large overhead.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

*Akhila Kambhatla,Taminul Islam,Khaled R Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArmFormer is a lightweight transformer-based semantic segmentation model for weapon categorization that integrates CBAM with MixVisionTransformer to deliver high accuracy (mIoU 80.64%, mF-score 89.13%) at real-time edge performance (82.26 FPS) with low compute (4.886 GFLOPs, 3.66M parameters) across five classes (handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, human).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract targets pixel-level threat assessment for real-time security scenarios, arguing that coarse bounding boxes from traditional detectors and resource-heavy segmentation models are insufficient for edge deployment.

Method: A CBAM-enhanced encoder backbone paired with an attention-integrated hamburger decoder within a MixVisionTransformer framework to perform multi-class weapon segmentation across handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, and human.

Result: The method claims state-of-the-art performance: 80.64% mIoU, 89.13% mFscore, 82.26 FPS, 4.886G FLOPs, 3.66M parameters, outperforming heavier models by up to 48x in compute.

Conclusion: ArmFormer presents a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency, advocating deployment on portable security cameras, drones, and embedded accelerators for real-time, edge-based weapon segmentation.

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

### [86] [BARL: Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label Spaces for Semi-Supervised Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16863)
*Shujian Gao,Yuan Wang,Zekuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL introduces Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label spaces for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, using Dual-Path Regularization and Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction for label-space alignment, plus region-level and lesion-instance matching for representation-space alignment, achieving state-of-the-art results across four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset; ablative studies validate each component.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-space consistency alone in current SSMIS methods is insufficient; representation-space alignment is crucial to learn discriminative and spatially coherent latent features, especially for fragmented pathological patterns in medical images.

Method: BARL deploys two collaborative branches. For label-space alignment it uses Dual-Path Regularization (DPR) and Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC) to enforce fine-grained cross-branch consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For representation-space alignment it performs region-level and lesion-instance matching between branches to capture complex pathological structures.

Result: BARL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods on four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: Joint alignment in both label and representation spaces improves semi-supervised medical image segmentation by producing more discriminative and spatially coherent features, with the two-branch BARL framework showing strong generalization and robustness; code will be released soon.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

### [87] [Registration is a Powerful Rotation-Invariance Learner for 3D Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16865)
*Yuyang Yu,Zhengwei Chen,Xuemiao Xu,Lei Zhang,Haoxin Yang,Yongwei Nie,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A registration-guided, rotation-invariant feature learning framework for 3D point-cloud anomaly detection that jointly optimizes registration and memory-based detection, achieving improved robustness to rotations and better local discrimination, with state-of-the-art results on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory bank-based 3D anomaly detection suffers from inconsistent feature transformations, limited discriminative capacity, and poor rotation invariance; failures in registration degrade detection reliability. Registration can align geometry and steer feature extraction toward rotation-invariant, locally discriminative representations, motivating a joint framework.

Method: Introduce a registration-induced feature extraction framework that integrates point-cloud registration objectives with memory-based anomaly detection. The network learns local geometric structures and cross-sample feature similarity, embedding feature extraction into the registration learning process, so alignment and representation learning are optimized jointly for rotation robustness and anomaly discrimination.

Result: Experiments on Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD demonstrate consistent improvements over existing approaches in effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing registration and feature learning yields robust, rotation-invariant representations and improved anomaly detection performance; indicates that registration guidance is beneficial for local geometric feature extraction in 3D anomaly detection.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

*Yudan Ren,Xinlong Wang,Kexin Wang,Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Zhaowei Li,Xiangrong Bi,Xiao Li,Xiaowei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuron-level multimodal analysis framework links artificial neuron activations with human brain activity in CLIP and METER, revealing shared representations, neuronal redundancy, polarity-aligned activation, and architecture-driven brain-like processing across networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research either studies unimodal ANNs lacking multimodal brain parallels or focuses on high-level outputs in multimodal ANNs, neglecting neuron-level dynamics. This work aims to map artificial neurons to human brain activity to uncover brain-like processing in VLMs.

Method: Integrates fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with fMRI-based voxel encoding to study two VLMs (CLIP and METER). Examines AN-BN predictivity across language, vision, attention, and default mode networks; analyzes representational redundancy, neuron polarity patterns, and architecture-driven BN differences.

Result: (1) ANs predict BN activities across multiple functional networks; (2) AN and BN representations show overlap indicating redundancy; (3) AN polarity patterns parallel BN activity with mirrored trends across layers; (4) CLIP and METER architectures drive distinct BN patterns (CLIP shows modality-specific specialization; METER yields unified cross-modal activation).

Conclusion: The findings support brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level and underscore the impact of architectural design on brain-like properties, bridging artificial and biological multimodal processing.

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

*Nusrat Munia,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model with an integrated classifier (Class-N-Diff) jointly generates and classifies dermoscopic images to improve class-conditioned synthesis for skin-cancer diagnostics; code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image synthesis often struggles to accurately represent specific classes; combining generation and classification can improve realism, diversity, and diagnostic utility.

Method: Incorporate a classifier into a diffusion model to steer image synthesis via class conditions; train jointly to optimize generation quality and classification accuracy.

Result: Produces more realistic and diverse dermoscopic images with better class alignment; the classifier also benefits, improving downstream diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: Integrating classification into diffusion models yields a robust framework for synthetic dermoscopy data and classification, with practical code released.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

*Zongjian Li,Zheyuan Liu,Qihui Zhang,Bin Lin,Shenghai Yuan,Zhiyuan Yan,Yang Ye,Wangbo Yu,Yuwei Niu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-training policy optimization for instruction-based image editing (Edit-R1/UniWorld-V2) using DiffusionNFT and MLLM rewards; achieves state-of-the-art on ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench; model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting to annotated patterns when training solely with supervised fine-tuning limits generalization; need a flexible, evaluation-free reward and policy optimization framework for broader instruction-based editing.

Method: DiffusionNFT: likelihood-free policy optimization aligned with flow-matching forward process; supports higher-order samplers; uses Multimodal LLM as a training-free reward with a low-variance group filtering to stabilize optimization; framework is post-training and model-agnostic.

Result: UniWorld-V2 achieves state-of-the-art scores of 4.49 on ImgEdit and 7.83 on GEdit-Bench; performance gains across base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext; code and models released.

Conclusion: The proposed post-training framework generalizes instruction-based image editing beyond training distributions and is broadly applicable across models, enabling robust, high-quality editing with diverse instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

### [91] [Contrail-to-Flight Attribution Using Ground Visible Cameras and Flight Surveillance Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16891)
*Ramon Dalmau,Gabriel Jarry,Philippe Very*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a ground-based, modular contrail-to-flight attribution framework using the GVCCS dataset to connect observed contrails with source flights, addressing satellite attribution limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails and other non-CO2 effects significantly affect aviation climate impact; linking observed contrails to flights is essential for model validation, but satellite attribution is hindered by resolution and drift; ground-based observations offer high-res, timely contrail data.

Method: Proposes a modular attribution framework that supports multiple geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal smoothing, and uses probability-based assignment to map observed contrails to theoretical contrails generated from aircraft surveillance and meteorological data; uses GVCCS dataset as the observed contrail source.

Result: Establishes a strong baseline and a flexible framework for contrail-to-flight attribution, enabling more robust validation and calibration of contrail evolution models and serving as a foundation for future research.

Conclusion: The framework provides a versatile, extensible tool for linking contrails to source flights, improving the capacity to study and validate aviation non-CO2 effects.

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

*Akhila Kambhatla,Ahmed R Khaled*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models (SegFormer, DeepLabV3+, SegNeXt, Swin) outperform CNNs for binary thermal weapon segmentation on a real-world dataset, offering high accuracy and real-time inference with flexible speed-accuracy trade-offs. SegFormer-b5 leads in mIoU (94.15%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04%), while SegFormer-b0 offers fastest inference (98.32 FPS) with strong performance (mIoU 90.84%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle to capture long-range dependencies and fine structural details in thermal weapon segmentation, especially under low light and occlusion. Vision Transformers (ViTs) promise global context modeling and improved segmentation, but their effectiveness in thermal weapon segmentation needed evaluation.

Method: Evaluate four transformer-based architectures (SegFormer, DeepLabV3+, SegNeXt, Swin Transformer) on a custom thermal dataset of 9,711 images annotated via SAM2, within the MMSegmentation framework with standard augmentations to enable fair architectural comparisons for binary weapon segmentation.

Result: SegFormer-b5 achieves the highest mIoU (94.15%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04%). SegFormer-b0 is the fastest with 98.32 FPS and mIoU 90.84%. SegNeXt-mscans provides balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and 92.24% mIoU. DeepLabV3+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. Transformers show robust generalization in low-light and occluded thermal environments and offer flexible accuracy-speed trade-offs for real-time security applications.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures are effective for thermal weapon segmentation, delivering high accuracy and real-time capable performance. SegFormer variants, particularly SegFormer-b5, offer top-tier accuracy, while SegFormer-b0 provides rapid inference, supporting diverse deployment requirements in security contexts.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Res-Bench to evaluate resolution robustness of Multimodal LLMs using 14,400 samples across 12 resolutions and 6 capabilities, with robustness metrics (Spearman, ACE/RCE) and insights on preprocessing and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations focus on semantic accuracy; unclear how models perform under varying input resolutions; need measures of stability to ensure reliable performance in real-world multimodal tasks.

Method: Create Res-Bench: dataset of 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six capability dimensions; develop a robustness evaluation framework using Spearman correlation for resolution vs performance trends and ACE/RCE for volatility; perform large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs; analyze model-centric and task-centric robustness, preprocessing strategies (padding, super-resolution), and fine-tuning approaches.

Result: Conducted extensive cross-model analysis; report trends in robustness, effects of preprocessing and fine-tuning; provide guidance on stability improvements.

Conclusion: Res-Bench provides a systematic tool to quantify resolution robustness in MLLMs and can inform architecture, training, and preprocessing choices to enhance stability across input resolutions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have achieved strong zero-/few-shot performance in medical imaging, but the field lacks a unified synthesis across modalities, architectures, and applications.

Method: Systematic categorization of studies into vision-only vs vision-language FMs, analysis of training strategies and downstream tasks, quantitative meta-analysis of dataset usage and application domains, critical discussion of challenges and emerging solutions.

Result: Provides a structured, domain-spanning overview of FM architectures, training paradigms, and clinical tasks; identifies temporal trends in datasets and applications; highlights challenges and promising directions (federated learning, knowledge distillation, prompting).

Conclusion: Outlines future research directions to improve robustness, explainability, and clinical translation of FMs in medical imaging, accelerating real-world adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

TL;DR: A Bregman-divergence-based density-ratio matching framework for diffusion distillation that enables efficient one-step generation with improved one-step FID and good fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but are computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation accelerates them with fast student generators, yet existing objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. This work seeks a principled, convex-analytic framework to unify distillation objectives and improve speed-quality trade-offs.

Method: Formulates diffusion distillation as density-ratio matching under Bregman divergence (Di-Bregman). Provides a convex-analytic view that connects and unifies existing distillation objectives into a single framework of Bregman density-ratio matching, enabling efficient one-step generation.

Result: On CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation, Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID compared to reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity relative to the teacher.

Conclusion: Bregman density-ratio matching offers a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward

### [96] [CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16988)
*Junhao Zhao,Zishuai Liu,Ruili Fang,Jin Lu,Linghan Zhang,Fei Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARE is an end-to-end framework that aligns sequence-based and image-based representations for ADL recognition from event-triggered sensors using Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and a joint contrastive-classification objective, achieving state-of-the-art results and robustness across multiple CASAS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ADL recognition methods fall into two camps: sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order but lack spatial awareness and are noise-sensitive; image-based approaches capture global patterns but dilute temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion fails to align the two views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. There is a need for an approach that jointly aligns cross-representation views while maintaining discriminability for accurate ADL recognition.

Method: Propose CARE, which jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy. CARE uses (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding, (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective to learn aligned and discriminative embeddings in an end-to-end manner.

Result: CARE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three CASAS datasets: Milan 89.8%, Cairo 88.9%, and Kyoto7 73.3%, and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability.

Conclusion: CARE demonstrates that aligning sequence- and image-based representations through a joint contrastive-classification objective yields robust, discriminative embeddings for ADL recognition in smart homes, with strong performance and resilience to sensor issues.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

*Luca Zanella,Massimiliano Mancini,Yiming Wang,Alessio Tonioni,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online, training-free Video Step Grounding (VSG) using large multimodal models, with BaGLM Bayesian grounding that leverages past frames; achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets in a zero-shot online setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VSG tasks traditionally rely on labeled data and offline processing, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time decisions. The paper aims to enable online, training-free VSG by exploiting zero-shot capabilities of large multimodal models and further improves predictions by incorporating past frame context through Bayesian filtering.

Method: 1) Use LMMs to predict the step associated with a restricted set of frames in an online, frame-by-frame fashion without accessing the full video. 2) Introduce BaGLM (Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models) that injects knowledge from past frames via (i) a step-transition dependency matrix derived from large language models and (ii) an estimation of step progress, combining these in a Bayesian framework to refine step predictions over time.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show that BaGLM plus the online zero-shot LMM strategy outperforms state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

Conclusion: Online, training-free VSG with LMMs is effective. BaGLM demonstrates that past-frame information via Bayesian filtering improves predictions, enabling real-time VSG without task-specific tuning and potentially lowering annotation costs.

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

*Ignacio M. De la Jara,Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo,Edison Marrese-Taylor,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video representations dramatically influence temporal video grounding performance; the study uncovers feature-specific strengths/weaknesses and hints at complementarity across CNN, temporal reasoning, and transformer encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter architectural overfitting and understand how different video features affect grounding accuracy on long untrimmed videos.

Method: Empirical study using a classical grounding architecture, evaluating features from CNN-based, temporal reasoning, and transformer encoders on Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions, and YouCookII.

Result: Performance varies significantly with the video encoder; certain features yield higher accuracy while others introduce systematic errors; evidence of complementary strengths among feature types.

Conclusion: Highlight the importance of exploring diverse video representations to avoid overfitting and potentially combine features for better temporal grounding.

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether remote-sensing specialized foundation models offer clear advantages over general-purpose vision models, given RS data have unique characteristics and robustness needs.

Method: (1) Create a simple benchmark that measures generalization of remote-sensing models to lower-resolution images for two downstream tasks. (2) Train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID (ImageNet-scale satellite data) with several RS-specific modifications, and compare to general-purpose baselines at ViT-B scale.

Result: None of the RS-pretrained models provided consistent improvements over general-purpose baselines at ViT-B scale.

Conclusion: Specialized remote-sensing foundation models do not necessarily outperform general-purpose models at small scales; the assumed advantage of specialization is not demonstrated in this setting, suggesting careful evaluation and potentially different scaling or tasks are needed.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

### [100] [Enrich and Detect: Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17023)
*Shraman Pramanick,Effrosyni Mavroudi,Yale Song,Rama Chellappa,Lorenzo Torresani,Triantafyllos Afouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ED-VTG proposes a two-stage grounding framework that converts text queries into enriched sentences and then grounds them with a lightweight decoder, trained with MIL to suppress noise, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal and paragraph grounding, especially in zero-shot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage multimodal LLMs for more precise, hallucination-robust fine-grained video temporal grounding and to unify temporal and paragraph grounding under an LLM-based approach.

Method: Stage 1: enrich queries by transforming them into detailed sentences incorporating missing cues; Stage 2: ground enriched queries with a lightweight decoder conditioned on contextualized representations; training with a multiple-instance-learning objective to dynamically select the best query variant per sample.

Result: State-of-the-art results on temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding benchmarks; outperforms prior LLM-based temporal grounding methods and rivals or surpasses specialized models, with strong zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that multimodal LLMs with query enrichment and MIL-based training can achieve competitive grounding performance, reducing hallucination effects and offering robust zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

### [101] [Where, Not What: Compelling Video LLMs to Learn Geometric Causality for 3D-Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17034)
*Yutong Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) introduces a training framework to mitigate 2D semantic bias in multimodal 3D grounding by learning disentangled 2D ‘What’ and 3D ‘Where’ representations, with dual losses for alignment and pseudo-label suppression, yielding improved localization on ScanRefer/ScanQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based 3D grounding relies heavily on 2D image features, leading to suboptimal fusion and errors in 3D spaces. A bias towards 2D semantics hurts precise 3D localization.

Method: Reshape internal space by making 2D features semantic beacons for 'What' and 3D geometry the spatial anchors for 'Where'. Use a dual-objective loss: Alignment Loss (adapted cross-entropy) to supervise fused predictions; Pseudo-Label Loss with a margin-based penalty to suppress 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs; no changes to inference architecture.

Result: On ScanRefer and ScanQA, W2R2 yields significant improvements in localization accuracy and robustness, notably in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: W2R2 successfully disentangles multimodal representations to reduce 2D bias, enabling more accurate 3D grounding without altering the inference pipeline.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

*Syed Konain Abbas,Sandip Purnapatra,M. G. Sarwar Murshed,Conor Miller-Lynch,Lambert Igene,Soumyabrata Dey,Stephanie Schuckers,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to generate privacy-preserving synthetic fingerprint data (live and spoof) using conditional StyleGAN2-ADA/StyleGAN3 and CycleGANs, producing two datasets with high realism and strong spoof-detection relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome privacy, cost, and accessibility barriers of collecting large real fingerprint datasets; synthetic data can enable robust evaluation and development of detection systems without leaking identities.

Method: Generate high-res live fingerprints conditioned on finger identity via conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3; translate to spoof fingerprints with CycleGANs across multiple materials; produce datasets DB2 and DB3 with 1,500 images per finger and per material; evaluate with FID, TAR at FAR, and standard metrics NFIQ2, MINDTCT; perform privacy leakage checks.

Result: StyleGAN3 achieves FID ~5; TAR 99.47% at FAR 0.01%; StyleGAN2-ADA TAR 98.67% at FAR 0.01%; high quality with NFIQ2 and MINDTCT; no significant identity leakage observed; datasets provide diverse spoof-material coverage.

Conclusion: Synthetic fingerprint datasets can effectively support privacy-preserving biometric research and robust spoof-detection development; demonstrates feasibility of conditional generative pipelines to create large, labeled live/spoof finger datasets.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline using VNet with semi-supervised learning improves segmentation reproducibility, radiomic stability, and prognostic accuracy for CT-based lung cancer across multi-center data, with clinicians preferring AI-initial masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation is variable and time-consuming; deep learning promises automation but faces barriers to clinical adoption. A clinician-centered, trustworthy AI workflow is needed to improve reproducibility, prognosis, and workflow integration.

Method: Compared five DL models (3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D) on whole and click-point cropped CT images using 999 patients from 12 public datasets. Assessed segmentation reproducibility via 497 PySERA radiomic features (Spearman, ICC, Wilcoxon, MANOVA). Built prognostic models comparing supervised vs semi-supervised learning across 38 dimensionality-reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians qualitatively rated masks across seven domains (clinical meaning, boundary, prognostic value, trust, workflow integration).

Result: VNet achieved top segmentation performance (Dice=0.83, IoU=0.71) and radiomic stability (mean correlation=0.76, ICC=0.65). SSL yielded superior prognostic accuracy (accuracy=0.88, F1=0.83) compared to supervised learning. Across models, SSL consistently outperformed SL. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement rather than replacement.

Conclusion: Integrating VNet with semi-supervised learning produces accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer prognosis, illustrating a feasible path toward physician-centered AI translation.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI

### [104] [Person Re-Identification via Generalized Class Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17043)
*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flexible retrieval-time representation selection framework for person re-identification that surpasses centroid-based representations, enabling multiple per-class representations and tunable trade-offs between accuracy and mean average precision (mAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centroid-based gallery representations during retrieval can be suboptimal for re-ID. There is a need for a more expressive, tunable representation set per identity to improve accuracy and mAP across diverse embeddings.

Method: Introduce a generalized representation selection method that is not restricted to class centroids. The method allows multiple representations per class (configurable per application) and is compatible with various re-ID embeddings, aiming to optimize the balance between accuracy and mAP during retrieval.

Result: Across multiple re-ID embeddings, the proposed method yields substantial improvements over state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Conclusion: A flexible, tunable retrieval-representation strategy improves re-ID performance beyond centroid-based approaches and can be adapted to different application requirements and embedding backbones.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Reason is an inference-time controller that tunes the LMM's value cache using an entropy objective, enabling micro-exploration/exploitation to reach RL-like accuracy without training, while cutting token usage by about 59% on video reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning and heavy chain-of-thought prompting for video reasoning are computationally expensive and limited in controlling the model's thinking dynamics. There is a need for an efficient, unsupervised way to regulate reasoning during inference.

Method: Analyze entropy of model outputs to reveal micro-exploration/exploitation dynamics. Introduce V-Reason, a small trainable controller that, during inference, performs a few optimization steps to adjust the model's value cache using an entropy-based objective, with no dataset supervision or RL. This tunes reasoning behavior without fine-tuning the base model.

Result: Significant improvements over base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets; narrows the gap to RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy, without any training. Output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Conclusion: Inference-time, entropy-guided tuning of the model’s internal value cache is an effective, efficient alternative to RL or supervised fine-tuning for video reasoning, enabling near-RL performance with substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Specialized SAM2 excels at spatial tasks like depth estimation but sacrifices broader semantic understanding, underperforming Hiera on pose estimation and image captioning; cross-neck adaptation reveals accumulating representational bottlenecks. This work provides a quantitative basis for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation strategies across downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and specialized encoders for feature coding, and to establish a quantitative framework for designing adaptable, efficient representations.

Method: Use a lightweight trainable neck to probe the adaptability of frozen features from the generalist Hiera and the specialized SAM2, measure the information-theoretic cost of specialization, and perform a novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 to trace bottlenecks at different adaptation levels.

Result: SAM2’s specialization yields strong performance on spatial tasks (e.g., depth estimation) but at the cost of reduced performance on conceptually distant tasks (pose estimation, image captioning) compared to Hiera, indicating a loss of broad semantic information. Cross-neck analysis shows each adaptation level adds a new representational bottleneck.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative foundation for assessing feature universality and informs design strategies for efficient feature coding and adaptation across diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

*Zhe Luo,Wenjing Jia,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDAT introduces a density-aware tail-drop mechanism enabling progressive decoding in learned point cloud geometry coding, achieving superior BD-rate efficiency across SemanticKITTI and ShapeNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time processing of 3D point clouds requires progressive decoding due to bandwidth and resource constraints; existing learning-based geometry codes use fixed latent representations that do not support progressive decoding.

Method: ProDAT employs a density-aware tail-drop mechanism that uses density information as a guidance signal to adaptively decode latent features and coordinates based on their significance, enabling progressive decoding at multiple bitrates with a single model.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that ProDAT enables progressive coding and achieves superior coding efficiency compared with state-of-the-art learning-based methods, with BD-rate improvements of over 28.6% for PSNR-D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet.

Conclusion: ProDAT effectively enables progressive point cloud coding with improved coding efficiency, offering a single model capable of progressive decoding across multiple bitrates and demonstrating strong performance on standard datasets.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

TL;DR: FMCAF: a preprocessing RGB–IR fusion framework with a frequency-domain filter (Freq-Filter) to suppress redundant spectra and a cross-attention fusion module (MCAF) to enhance intermodal sharing. It aims for generalizability across datasets, outperforming standard concatenation fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal object detection benefits from complementary cues across modalities, but naive fusion can be hindered by redundant spectral information and dataset-specific tuning. A dataset-agnostic fusion architecture could improve robustness across diverse conditions.

Method: Introduce FMCAF: a two-stage fusion pipeline where (1) Freq-Filter filters spectral content in the frequency domain to reduce redundancy, and (2) MCAF uses cross-attention to fuse RGB and IR features, forming a flexible, dataset-agnostic preprocessing fusion module for detection networks.

Result: FMCAF outperforms simple concatenation fusion on two datasets (LLVIP and VEDAI), achieving +13.9% mAP@50 on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP, indicating strong generalizability and robustness across modalities.

Conclusion: FMCAF provides a generalizable, flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in detection pipelines, combining frequency-domain denoising with cross-modal attention to improve intermodal feature sharing without dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane enhances Gaussian Splatting by injecting planar priors to reconstruct clean, structured planes and meshes in 3D scenes, enabling robust geometry and manipulation without sacrificing rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of reconstructing smooth, accurate planar regions with state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting, especially in man-made environments.

Method: Use off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction to extract planar priors and guide training with planar Gaussian coordinates; dynamic Gaussian re-classifier to switch persistently high-gradient Gaussians from planar to non-planar; refine mesh layouts using optimized planar priors; demonstrate decoupled manipulation of objects on planes; evaluate against baselines.

Result: Planar priors improve geometric accuracy of meshes across baselines while maintaining rendering quality; cleaner mesh connectivity with fewer vertices and faces.

Conclusion: Integrating planar priors into GS yields better planar geometry and topology, enabling structured representations and plane-based manipulation in 3D scenes.

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

*Xiaogang Xu,Jian Wang,Yunfan Lu,Ruihang Chu,Ruixing Wang,Jiafei Wu,Bei Yu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent refinement conditioning framework for pre-trained diffusion models that boosts content fidelity in low-light restoration by recovering VAE-encoded details and enabling bidirectional interaction between refined and noisy latents, implemented as a plug-and-play module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained diffusion-based methods often lose content fidelity in pursuit of perceptual realism, especially in severely degraded (low-light) scenarios. This fidelity gap arises from inadequate conditional latent modeling and the lack of bidirectional conditioning with the noisy latent.

Method: Introduce a latent refinement pipeline that recovers spatial details lost during VAE encoding using generative priors. Enable dynamic, bidirectional interaction between the refined latent condition and the noisy latent during the diffusion process. The solution is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be integrated into existing diffusion networks to improve fidelity.

Result: Experiments show significant fidelity improvements for PTDB diffusion methods in restoration tasks, with better preservation of content and structure while maintaining realism.

Conclusion: The conditioning optimization enhances content fidelity in diffusion-based restoration without sacrificing aesthetics, and its plug-and-play nature facilitates adoption across existing pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

TL;DR: Invisible watermarking in LED lighting that is perceptually hidden from humans but detectable by consumer cameras; uses spectral modulation rather than brightness changes to embed data into video at standard frame rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy protection and content verification by embedding metadata into the environment’s lighting, leveraging everyday LED lighting to carry information without affecting viewer perception.

Method: Optimize the LED spectral profile to minimize human visual impact while maximizing camera-detectable signals. Model human LTV sensitivity, camera spectral responses, and the broadband achievable from narrowband LEDs (to mimic D65 white). Use spectral modulation (not intensity modulation) to embed a watermark; extractable from standard video frame rates (30–60 fps).

Result: Embeds 128 bits in a 10-second video clip (approx. 12.8 bps), enabling essential metadata transfer for privacy and verification while remaining visually imperceptible.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates covert, camera-readable watermarking via environmental lighting, suitable for metadata transfer without impacting human observers. Robustness to real-world conditions and variations in lighting, camera hardware, and scene content are key factors for future work.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

### [112] [GOOD: Training-Free Guided Diffusion Sampling for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17131)
*Xin Gao,Jiyao Liu,Guanghao Li,Yueming Lyu,Jianxiong Gao,Weichen Yu,Ningsheng Xu,Liang Wang,Caifeng Shan,Ziwei Liu,Chenyang Si*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOOD is a dual-guided diffusion framework that steers image generation toward OOD regions using in-distribution classifiers, yielding diverse, controllable OOD samples and improved detector robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches perturb text-conditioned embeddings for OOD synthesis, which causes semantic instability and limited shift diversity, hindering generalization to realistic OOD; a better generation strategy is needed.

Method: Integrate two guides into diffusion sampling: (1) image-level guidance via gradient of log partition to push samples to low-density pixel regions; (2) feature-level guidance via k-NN distance in ID classifier's latent space to favor sparse feature regions; use off-the-shelf ID classifiers; combine image and feature discrepancies into a unified OOD score.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative analyses show GOOD-generated samples improve OOD detection performance when used for training; the approach yields more controllable and diverse OOD samples and robust detection.

Conclusion: GOOD offers a flexible, effective framework for generating realistic, diverse OOD samples and boosting OOD detector robustness; it generalizes across classifiers and enhances realism of OOD samples.

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

### [113] [KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object Shape Reconstruction and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17137)
*WenBo Xu,Liu Liu,Li Zhang,Ran Zhang,Hao Wu,Dan Guo,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, category-level articulated object reconstruction and pose estimation framework named KineDiff3D that uses a KA-VAE and two conditional diffusion models, plus iterative optimization, to reconstruct geometry and infer kinematics from single-view input; validated on synthetic to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated objects have multi-part geometries and variable joints causing high structural diversity across states, making single-view category-level reconstruction and kinematic estimation challenging.

Method: Encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part segmentation into a structured latent space via KA-VAE; use two conditional diffusion models: (1) regress global pose SE(3) and joint parameters, (2) generate kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations; iterative optimization refining reconstruction and kinematic parameters by Chamfer-distance minimization while preserving articulation constraints.

Result: Demonstrates accurate reconstruction of articulated objects and estimation of kinematic properties across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: KineDiff3D provides a unified, robust framework for category-level articulated object reconstruction and generation from single-view data, integrating geometry and kinematics through diffusion-based modeling and optimization.

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

### [114] [GACO-CAD: Geometry-Augmented and Conciseness-Optimized CAD Model Generation from Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17157)
*Yinghui Wang,Xinyu Zhang,Peng Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage post-training framework (GACO-CAD) improves single-image editable CAD model generation by using depth and normal priors during supervised fine-tuning and a group-length reward in reinforcement learning to enhance geometric accuracy and conciseness, achieving SOTA on DeepCAD and Fusion360 with the same MLLM backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle to infer accurate 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning; there is a need to improve geometric fidelity and modeling efficiency for single-view CAD reconstruction.

Method: Stage 1: supervised fine-tuning with multi-channel input combining RGB, depth, and surface normals as geometric priors to guide 3D recovery. Stage 2: reinforcement learning with a group-length reward to encourage compact, non-redundant parametric modeling sequences while preserving high geometric fidelity; uses a simple dynamic weighting strategy for training stability.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets under the same MLLM backbone, with consistent improvements in code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric priors and optimization-guided modeling sequences via a two-stage training pipeline enables more accurate and compact single-view CAD reconstruction, lowering barriers to industrial concept design.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

### [115] [Investigating Adversarial Robustness against Preprocessing used in Blackbox Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17169)
*Roland Croft,Brian Du,Darcy Joseph,Sharath Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Preprocessing steps in face recognition heavily influence adversarial attack transferability; blackbox attacks can be thwarted or helped by detector choices, while preprocessing can even reduce attack strength in whitebox settings. A preprocessing-invariant transformation can improve transferability of such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how face preprocessing affects adversarial vulnerability and attack transferability in FR systems, especially under blackbox conditions, and to identify defenses that generalize across preprocessing variations.

Method: Evaluate several off-the-shelf adversarial attacks against FR pipelines with varying preprocessing components (face detection models, downsampling/interpolation methods) in blackbox and whitebox settings; assess transferability of attacks; propose input-transform-based preprocessing-invariant mitigation to improve attack transferability.

Result: Attack success is highly dependent on the face detector choice (up to ~78% reduction in effectiveness with certain detectors) while interpolation method has minor impact. In whitebox scenarios, preprocessing can degrade attack strength due to interactions with face detectors. A preprocessing-invariant input transformation improves transferability by up to ~27%.

Conclusion: Preprocessing is a critical but often neglected factor in FR adversarial robustness. Accounting for preprocessing variations can improve attack generalization, and preprocessing-invariant defenses can mitigate vulnerabilities across preprocessing pipelines.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

### [116] [Generation then Reconstruction: Accelerating Masked Autoregressive Models via Two-Stage Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17171)
*Feihong Yan,Peiru Wang,Yao Zhu,Kaiyu Pang,Qingyan Wei,Huiqi Li,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generation then Reconstruction (GtR) speeds up MAR-based image generation by splitting generation into a slow structure-generation stage and a fast detail-reconstruction stage, guided by Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) that allocates more budget to high-frequency detail tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAR models are limited in acceleration due to the modeling complexity of spatially correlated tokens; a training-free hierarchical sampling strategy can accelerate generation without sacrificing quality by focusing computation on detail regions.

Method: GtR performs two-stage sampling: (1) structure generation to establish global semantic scaffolding, then (2) detail reconstruction to fill remaining tokens quickly. FTS allocates more computation to detail tokens by weighting tokens based on energy in high-frequency components. Evaluated on MAR-H for ImageNet class-conditional and text-to-image generation.

Result: Achieves 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining comparable quality (FID 1.59, IS 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1). Outperforms existing acceleration methods across scales and tasks.

Conclusion: GtR with FTS provides an effective, training-free route to accelerate MAR models without significant loss in generation quality, with code to be released.

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

### [117] [Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Detection for Plankton Recognition: A Systematic Evaluation of Advanced Methods in Marine Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17179)
*Yingzi Han,Jiakai He,Chuanlong Xie,Jianping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale evaluation of Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection for automated plankton recognition using the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset. ViM emerges as the top method, especially in Far-OoD scenarios; provides a benchmark and code for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plankton recognition suffers from distribution shifts due to diverse morphologies, vast species diversity, and continuous discovery of novel species. There is a lack of unified OoD benchmarks and integration of recent CV advances, hindering robust deployment.

Method: The authors designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating distribution shifts based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset and systematically evaluated 22 OoD detection methods. They identify ViM as the leading approach across benchmarks, with notable gains in Far-OoD settings.

Result: ViM outperforms other methods across the constructed benchmarks, with substantial improvements in Far-OoD scenarios. The study provides a comprehensive evaluation that can guide method selection and establishes a solid foundation for plankton OoD detection research.

Conclusion: This work delivers the first large-scale, systematic plankton OoD evaluation, offering benchmarks and code (GitHub) to accelerate future research and deployment in real-world plankton recognition.

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

### [118] [Capturing Head Avatar with Hand Contacts from a Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17181)
*Haonan He,Yufeng Zheng,Jie Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for photorealistic 3D head avatars that jointly models head geometry and hand-induced deformations from monocular video, using depth-order and contact regularization for pose, a PCA basis learned from a hand-face dataset, and a physics-inspired contact loss; improves appearance and deformation accuracy over SOTA on real iPhone RGB(D) data and on a synthetic evaluation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current head-avatar methods largely ignore hand-face interactions, failing to capture natural resting poses and cognitive cues. There is a need to jointly model hand-face pose and non-rigid deformations, even without strong priors, and to avoid interpenetration artifacts.

Method: 1) Joint learning of head avatar and hand-face deformation; 2) depth-order loss plus contact regularization to enforce correct face-hand spatial relationships during pose tracking; 3) learn a PCA-based hand-induced facial deformation basis from a dedicated hand-face interaction dataset to reduce to a compact parameter space; 4) introduce a physics-inspired contact loss to further supervise and reduce interpenetration; 5) evaluate on RGB(D) iPhone videos; 6) construct a synthetic avatar dataset with various hand interactions for improved evaluation.

Result: The approach yields improved appearance and more accurate deforming geometry of the face compared to state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods, with reduced interpenetration and higher physical plausibility, validated on real and synthetic data.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and benefits of jointly modeling hand-face interactions for realistic avatars. Key contributions include a compact PCA-based deformation model for hand-induced facial changes and a contact-loss supervision strategy. This paves the way for more realistic telepresence, gaming, and VR avatars, with future work likely expanding priors and interaction types.

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

### [119] [HIDISC: A Hyperbolic Framework for Domain Generalization with Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17188)
*Vaibhav Rathore,Divyam Gupta,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIDISC introduces a hyperbolic learning framework for domain-generalized generalized category discovery (DG-GCD) without episodic training. It uses GPT-guided diffusion for diverse yet compact domain variation, Tangent CutMix to synthesize pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, and a unified loss with Busemann alignment, hyperbolic contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion. A learnable curvature parameter adapts geometry to data, achieving state-of-the-art on PACS, Office-Home, and DomainNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world DG-GCD requires generalizing to unseen domains and novel categories without target-domain data. Existing methods either rely on labeled/unlabeled data from the same distribution (GCD) or costly episodic training across synthetic domains (DG2CD-Net). A principled, efficient approach that leverages non-Euclidean geometry to structure representations and uses targeted data augmentation is needed.

Method: HIDISC uses hyperbolic representation learning to capture hierarchical/curved data structure. Domain variation is exposed via GPT-guided diffusion on the source domain. Tangent CutMix performs curvature-aware interpolation in tangent space to synthesize pseudo-novel samples while preserving manifold consistency. A unified loss combines penalized Busemann alignment (to align distributions in hyperbolic space), hybrid hyperbolic contrastive regularization (to tighten intra-class and separate inter-class structure), and adaptive outlier repulsion. A learnable curvature parameter adapts the geometry to the dataset.

Result: HIDISC achieves state-of-the-art results on standard DG-GCD benchmarks: PACS, Office-Home, and DomainNet, consistently outperforming existing Euclidean and hyperbolic DG-GCD baselines.

Conclusion: The framework provides efficient domain and category generalization without episodic simulation. The curvature-adaptive hyperbolic geometry, together with targeted augmentation and tangent-space interpolation, yields compact, semantically structured embeddings and strong generalization to unseen domains and novel categories.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

### [120] [ZSPAPrune: Zero-Shot Prompt-Aware Token Pruning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17197)
*Pu Zhang,Yuwei Li,Xingyuan Xian,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot, prompt-aware token pruning method for Vision-Language Models that balances task relevance and information diversity to prune visual tokens efficiently, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy with up to 90% pruning and notable speed/memory gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference costs and memory usage in Vision-Language Models by prioritizing task-relevant visual tokens guided by the natural language prompt, addressing the blind spots of prior attention- or diversity-based pruning methods that ignore prompt guidance.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical, prompt-aware pruning pipeline: first select a core set of task-relevant visual tokens, then supplement with diversity tokens to preserve broader context; operates in a zero-shot setting without task-specific training.

Result: Attains performance matching or surpassing state-of-the-art with minimal accuracy loss under heavy pruning (up to 90%), and achieves substantial reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency across multiple models and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that incorporating text-driven prompt guidance into token pruning is an effective strategy for scaling VLMs, enabling large-input processing with reduced computation while maintaining task performance; promising for broader applicability to other token-based modalities.

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

*M Saifuzzaman Rafat,Mohd Ruhul Ameen,Akif Islam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-performance, fine-tuned SAM approach detects and quantifies land loss from river erosion in Bangladesh using a new manually annotated dataset (2003–2025) of disappeared settlements; achieving IoU 86.30% and Dice 92.60% and offering a dataset, specialized model, and a method for visualizing erosion for policy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangladesh's river dynamics regularly destroy settlements, causing displacement and loss. Traditional monitoring is labor-intensive and slow; there is a need for scalable, accurate detection and quantification of erosion-driven land loss to support disaster management and policy.

Method: Create a historical dataset from Google Earth imagery (2003–2025) of vulnerable regions; manually annotate disappeared settlements. Use an initial color-channel-based rough land-water segmentation, then fine-tune SAM's mask decoder to capture erosion signatures. Evaluate with segmentation metrics (IoU, Dice).

Result: Mean IoU: 86.30%; Dice score: 92.60%. Outperforms traditional methods and off-the-shelf models. Three main contributions: (1) first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements due to river erosion in Bangladesh; (2) a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this task; (3) a method to quantify land loss with compelling visual evidence.

Conclusion: The approach provides a powerful new tool for policymakers and disaster agencies to monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and protect vulnerable communities, enabling timely intervention and better planning.

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

*Nirai Hayakawa,Kazumasa Shimari,Kazuma Yamasaki,Hirotatsu Hoshikawa,Rikuto Tsuchida,Kenichi Matsumoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A TimeSformer-based approach augmented with tactical minimap features improves round outcome prediction in VALORANT to ~81% accuracy, especially in mid-round stages, outperforming models that rely on minimap information alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Esports outcome prediction has mostly used match logs and statistics; VALORANT’s tactical complexity and dynamic match footage are underexplored. Exploiting tactical cues from minimap-based game states could improve predictive accuracy.

Method: Utilize the TimeSformer video recognition model and augment the training data with tactical features extracted from minimap information (e.g., character positions and in-game events). Train on this augmented dataset and compare against a baseline model trained on minimap data alone.

Result: Preliminary results indicate ~81% prediction accuracy, with significant gains from the middle phase of rounds, outperforming a model trained on minimap data alone.

Conclusion: Leveraging tactical features derived from match footage can be highly effective for predicting VALORANT round outcomes, highlighting the value of video-based tactical information for esports analytics.

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

*Bingrong Liu,Jun Shi,Yushan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoCIL presents a unified class-incremental learning framework for endoscopic image diagnosis, integrating distribution-aligned replay, class-balanced loss with priors, and gradient calibration to curb forgetting and bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in CIL for endoscopy due to domain shifts and class imbalance; enable continual learning in clinical practice.

Method: Three components: MDBR with distribution-aligned greedy exemplar selection; PRCBL integrating prior class distributions and balance weights into loss; CFG adjusting fully-connected gradients to reduce bias toward new classes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods on four public endoscopic datasets across buffer sizes and metrics; demonstrates improved stability-plasticity trade-off.

Conclusion: EndoCIL offers a scalable, clinically viable approach to lifelong endoscopic diagnosis, balancing performance retention with adaptation.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

### [124] [Optimizing DINOv2 with Registers for Face Anti-Spoofing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17201)
*Mika Feng,Pierre Gallin-Martel,Koichi Ito,Takafumi Aoki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DINOv2-based spoofing detector detects live versus spoofed faces by focusing on minute cues, enabling spoofing detection before face recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoofing via presenting a registered user’s photo. Pre-recognition spoofing detection is essential to prevent unauthorized access.

Method: Leverages DINOv2 with registers to extract generalizable features and suppress perturbations in the attention mechanism, enabling focused attention on tiny discriminative cues between live and spoof images. Evaluated on The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop dataset (Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025) and the SiW dataset.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in distinguishing live versus spoofed faces on the targeted datasets, indicating good practical performance and generalization to spoofing variants.

Conclusion: A DINOv2-based approach with attention stabilization can improve pre-recognition spoof detection by capturing subtle live cues while reducing noisy attention, contributing to more secure face authentication.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

### [125] [$\mathcal{V}isi\mathcal{P}runer$: Decoding Discontinuous Cross-Modal Dynamics for Efficient Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17205)
*Yingqi Fan,Anhao Zhao,Jinlan Fu,Junlong Tong,Hui Su,Yijie Pan,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPruner is a training-free token pruning framework for Multimodal LLMs that leverages a three-stage cross-modal processing insight to drastically cut vision-related attention and FLOPs (up to 99% and 53.9% respectively on LLaVA-v1.5 7B), outperforming prior pruning methods and generalizing across MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs incur heavy quadratic attention costs due to visual tokens; there is a lack of understanding of how multimodal information is fused across layers. Uncovering this processing dynamic can guide efficient model design and pruning.

Method: Systematic analysis reveals a three-stage cross-modal interaction: shallow layers set task intent with visual tokens as passive attention sinks; middle layers undergo abrupt fusion driven by a few critical visual tokens; deep layers discard vision tokens and focus on linguistic refinement. Based on this, VisPruner is a training-free pruning framework that identifies and prunes non-critical vision tokens to drastically reduce vision-related attention and FLOPs without retraining.

Result: Quantitative gains include up to 99% reduction in vision-related attention and 53.9% FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. VisPruner outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across diverse MLLMs.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable guidelines for aligning MLLM architecture with intrinsic processing dynamics to enable efficient training and inference, and demonstrates that substantial computational savings are achievable without retraining. Code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

*Zhuo Cao,Heming Du,Bingqing Zhang,Xin Yu,Xue Li,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces QV-M^2, a multi-moment video grounding dataset, and FlashMMR, a framework with post-verification and temporal adjustment to improve multi-moment retrieval (MMR); shows performance gains and provides code as a benchmark baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moment retrieval (MR) research emphasizes single-moment grounding, which mismatches real-world needs where a query maps to multiple moments. There is a gap in datasets, evaluation metrics, and methods for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). The work fills this gap by offering a high-quality multi-moment dataset and a specialized framework.

Method: 1) Construct QV-M^2 with 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments to enable MMR; 2) Propose FlashMMR with a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine moment boundaries, constrained temporal adjustment, and a verification module to re-evaluate candidate segments; 3) Implement a filtering pipeline to prune low-confidence proposals for robust multi-moment alignment; 4) Retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M^2 and QVHighlights under SMR and MMR settings.

Result: QV-M^2 provides a realistic benchmark with 2,212 annotations over 6,384 segments; FlashMMR yields gains over prior SOTA by 3.00% (G-mAP), 2.70% (mAP@3+tgt), and 2.56% (mR@3) on QV-M^2; six existing MR methods gain better performance under MMR; code is released at the given GitHub URL.

Conclusion: QV-M^2 and FlashMMR advance video temporal grounding towards real-world multi-moment scenarios, establishing a benchmark and a strong baseline for future research; the dataset and approach facilitate training and evaluating MMR models in more challenging settings.

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

*Akihito Yoshii,Ryosuke Sonoda,Ramya Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fairness-aware deepfake detector that jointly models temporal dynamics and demographic biases, using sequence-based temporal clustering and demographic-aware data augmentation with frequency-domain transforms, plus concept extraction for interpretability, achieving superior fairness–accuracy tradeoffs on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors suffer from bias, opacity, and neglect of temporal information, leading to unfair or unreliable decisions across demographic groups; there is a need for transparent, fair, and temporally informed detection.

Method: Proposes a framework combining (i) sequence-based clustering for temporal modeling of deepfake videos, (ii) concept extraction for interpretability, (iii) demography-aware data augmentation to balance underrepresented groups and preserve artifacts via frequency-domain transformations; employs state-of-the-art backbones (Xception, ResNet) and evaluates on FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, DFDC.

Result: Empirically demonstrates the best trade-off between fairness and accuracy among SoTA methods across the tested benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fairness and interpretability can be significantly enhanced without sacrificing performance by integrating temporal modeling and demographic-aware augmentation; the approach improves reliability across demographic groups and offers interpretable decisions for non-expert users.

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineVision offers a large, clean, unified multimodal dataset (24M samples from 200+ sources) created via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline with rigorous de-duplication, decontamination, and schema validation, improving vision-language model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public VLM datasets are fragmented and contaminated, hindering data-centric model training. A large, harmonized, and clean corpus could unlock more reliable and scalable improvements.

Method: A semi-automated ingestion and schema-mapping pipeline aggregates 200+ sources into 185 subsets. Human reviewers audit mappings, spot-check outputs, and trigger fixes; the workflow includes deduplication within/between sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. The approach also unifies agentic/GUI tasks with a shared action space and validates executable fidelity via sample trajectories.

Result: Models trained on FineVision outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, demonstrating gains from scale, data hygiene, and the hybrid automation with human oversight.

Conclusion: A curated, scalable, and validated dataset like FineVision can meaningfully boost VLM performance and accelerate data-centric research, justifying the release of the corpus and curation tools to the community.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

*Katie Luo,Jingwei Ji,Tong He,Runsheng Xu,Yichen Xie,Dragomir Anguelov,Mingxing Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PnF is a plug-and-play method that uses multimodal LLMs to augment motion forecasting with structured scene embeddings, enabling zero-shot improvements without fine-tuning; validated on Waymo Open Motion and nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization to diverse real-world driving scenarios and cost-effective adaptation. Existing specialized perception/prediction models often struggle out of distribution; a modular, language-guided approach can quickly adapt to targeted behaviors.

Method: Design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from multimodal LLMs, then distill this information into learnable embeddings that augment existing motion prediction models. The approach leverages zero-shot reasoning and requires no fine-tuning.

Result: Demonstrates significant, consistent improvements in motion prediction across two state-of-the-art models and two benchmarks (Waymo Open Motion and nuScenes) without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Shows that plugging MLLMs into motion forecasting via scene-embedding augmentation is practical and effective for robust performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting a viable path for adaptable forecasting without retraining.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

*Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Mostafa Mohammadpour,Ghasem Farjamnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A saliency-guided cross-layer deep feature fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) for WBC segmentation and classification, achieving improved robustness and interpretability on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate WBC analysis is hindered by staining variability, complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. There is a need for robust and interpretable methods that highlight candidate regions and provide explanations.

Method: Saliency priors guide feature extraction; a lightweight EfficientSwin-style backbone produces multi-resolution features; a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module preserves complementary information from shallow and deep layers; a multi-task setup with segmentation and cell-type classification heads; class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization; interpretability via Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks; training and evaluation on BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB with IoU, F1, and accuracy metrics; ablation to validate contributions.

Result: The framework achieves consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy over strong CNN and transformer baselines; ablation confirms the individual contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion.

Conclusion: SG-CLDFF offers a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-guided automated surgical lighting system uses YOLOv11 to locate a blue marker and steer a dual-axis LED light via servomotors, achieving 96.7% mAP@50; automates lighting to reduce surgeon strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve ergonomics and illumination consistency in surgery by eliminating manual light adjustment, reducing fatigue and drift/shadowing.

Method: Object detection with YOLOv11 to identify blue marker above target site; two servomotors with tilt-pan brackets direct a high-power LED to the identified location; validation on annotated images simulating surgical scenes with a blue spherical marker; reported 96.7% mAP@50.

Result: The YOLO model achieved 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set; the system automates lighting, reducing physical strain on surgeons and improving illumination consistency, which could support better surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: Automating surgical lighting with a vision-based controller demonstrates feasibility and potential for improved ergonomics and illumination stability during procedures.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

*Siran Dai,Qianqian Xu,Peisong Wen,Yang Liu,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Longer SSL training can harm dense tasks; a Dense representation Structure Estimator (DSE) predicts dense task performance, enabling model selection and DSE-based regularization; yields ~3.0% mIoU gain on average across 16 methods with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL can degrade dense predictions (e.g., semantic segmentation) with longer training, and there is a lack of annotation-free, effective evaluation for dense performance. A data-driven proxy is needed to select models and regularize training.

Method: Introduce DSE consisting of a class-relevance measure and an effective dimensionality measure. Theoretically grounded and empirically validated to correlate with downstream performance. Use DSE for a model selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Evaluate across sixteen SSL methods and four benchmarks. Public code provided.

Result: DSE shows a close correlation with downstream dense performance. Model selection using DSE improves mIoU by about 3.0% on average with negligible computational cost. DSE-based regularization consistently mitigates dense degradation across methods and datasets. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Self-supervised dense degradation (SDD) is widespread across SSL methods. The proposed DSE offers a practical, efficient approach to predict and optimize dense-task performance, enabling effective model selection and regularization to stabilize semantic segmentation performance during SSL training.

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongInsightBench is a long-video, multi-modal benchmark (visual, audio, text) designed to test models on understanding long, information-dense videos with six task scenarios, plus a semi-automated QA pipeline. It reveals that Omni-modal models still struggle with precise temporal localization and long-range causal inference, and shows information loss in multi-modal fusion; dataset and code are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push video understanding beyond short-form content by evaluating models on long, information-dense videos across multiple modalities, addressing temporal reasoning, cross-modal fusion, and contextual comprehension.

Method: Assemble approximately 1,000 long videos from FineVideo based on duration and information density (lectures, interviews, vlogs) to form six challenging task scenarios (Intra-Event and Inter-Event). Develop a three-step semi-automated data quality assurance pipeline for synthesized questions/answers. Evaluate Omni-modal models on tasks emphasizing temporal localization and causal inference; extend analyses to uncover information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion.

Result: Omni-modal models exhibit persistent challenges in precise temporal localization and long-range causal inference. Extended experiments reveal information loss and processing bias during multi-modal fusion. The authors provide dataset and code access URLs.

Conclusion: LongInsightBench offers a rigorous, multi-modal benchmark for long-video understanding, exposing current OLM limitations in temporal alignment and cross-modal fusion while facilitating future research through public data/code release.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to
assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human
language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating
\textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key
areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select
approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on
duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities,
focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich
language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have
designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized
questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series
of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still
face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

### [134] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba is a two-stage, scalable framework for fMRI causal inference that first deconvolves BOLD signals to latent neural activity and then infers causal graphs via a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. It outperforms Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) on simulated data and shows high fidelity in recovering canonical neural circuits in real task fMRI, while revealing dynamic hub shifts between executive and salience networks based on stimulus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two core challenges in fMRI-based causal inference: (1) the ill-posed, hemodynamically distorted mapping from neural activity to BOLD signals, and (2) the computational intractability of existing causal methods like DCM for large-scale networks.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity from distorted fMRI signals; (2) causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture to infer directed causal relationships between recovered neural signals.

Result: On simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. On real task fMRI, it recovers canonical neural pathways with 88% fidelity across subjects, while conventional methods fail to identify these circuits in more than 99% of subjects. Network analysis of working memory data shows stimulus-dependent reconfiguration of hub recruitment between executive and salience networks, suggesting dynamic network strategies that traditional methods miss.

Conclusion: CausalMamba provides a scalable, practical tool for large-scale causal inference in neuroscience, capable of capturing core circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

*Wei Zhang,Zhanhao Hu,Xiao Li,Xiaopei Zhu,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-coverage adversarial clothing defeats patch-based defenses for object detectors, achieving high attack success in both digital and physical settings, including against nine defended models on Faster R-CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of existing adversarial defenses against physically-realizable, large-area patch attacks by using adversarial clothing that covers substantial portions of the body.

Method: Experimentally evaluate known defenses against adversarial patches, extend evaluation to adversarial clothing with large coverage, test on Faster R-CNN in digital and physical environments, and craft a single clothing set that breaks multiple defenses, measuring attack success rates.

Result: All defenses perform poorly against adversarial clothing. The crafted clothing set yields 96.06% ASR against an undefended detector and over 64.84% ASR against nine defended models in the physical world.

Conclusion: Current patch-based defenses are vulnerable to large-coverage adversarial clothing; highlights need for more robust, general defenses. Code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

*Gyuhwan Park,Kihyun Na,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based license plate restoration framework (CharDiff) uses character-level priors and a region-aware CHARM module to restore and recognize severely degraded plates, achieving 28% relative CER improvement on Roboflow-LP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: License plate restoration has value beyond preprocessing, improving evidential value, readability, and downstream use; existing diffusion-based approaches may lack precise character-level guidance; incorporating per-character priors can boost robustness under realistic degradation.

Method: CharDiff is a diffusion-based framework that leverages external segmentation and OCR modules to extract fine-grained character priors for low-quality license plates. It introduces the Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module to confine guidance to each character's region, preventing interference with other regions and enabling focused restoration and recognition.

Result: CharDiff significantly outperforms baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) on the Roboflow-LP dataset compared to the best-performing baseline.

Conclusion: Structured character-guided conditioning substantially enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in realistic deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

*Zhaoran Zhao,Xinli Yue,Jianhui Sun,Yuhao Xie,Tao Shao,Liangchao Yao,Fan Xia,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iDETEX is a unified multimodal LLM for image quality assessment that jointly performs quality grounding, perception, and description. It uses task-specific offline augmentations, a data-mixing strategy, and online enhancement to enable robust, multi-source supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results on ViDA-UGC and ranking first in the ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed IQA Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shift from scalar, opaque IQA to detailed, interpretable, human-aligned evaluation. A unified model that can handle multiple subtasks—grounding quality, perceiving image quality aspects, and generating descriptions—can improve interpretability and efficiency, especially when leveraging heterogeneous data and supervision sources.

Method: Propose iDETEX, a unified multimodal LLM designed for three IQA subtasks: quality grounding, perception, and description. To train across heterogeneous subtasks, introduce a suite of task-specific offline augmentation modules and a data mixing strategy. Employ online enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision.

Result: iDETEX achieves state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark and ranks first in the ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in quality assessments.

Conclusion: A unified multimodal LLM can effectively tackle explainable IQA, delivering accurate and interpretable assessments across multiple subtasks and data sources. This approach sets a new benchmark and suggests avenues for broader, explainable QA tasks in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

### [138] [Nearest-Class Mean and Logits Agreement for Wildlife Open-Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17338)
*Jiahao Huo,Mufhumudzi Muthivhi,Terence L. van Zyl,Fredrik Gustafsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-processing open-set recognition method using a Nearest Class Mean (NCM) distance-based distribution to gauge agreement with the model's softmax logits, enabling unknown rejection without retraining. It achieves top-3 performance on two wildlife OSR datasets, with AUROC of 93.41 (African animals) and 95.35 (Swedish animals).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-set recognition (OSR) addresses the problem that closed-world classifiers are overconfident on unknown samples and must reject them. Existing OSR methods often require retraining the base classifier with OSR-specific strategies, which is inefficient. This work motivates a post-processing approach that leverages the relationship between feature-space (NCM) distances and logit-space (softmax) outputs to detect unknowns without modifying the original model.

Method: Compute a probability distribution from the input's distance to its Nearest Class Mean (NCM) in feature space. Compare this NCM-based distribution with the model's softmax (logit) probabilities to measure agreement between the feature-space and logit-space representations. Use this agreement as an OSR score to reject unknowns without retraining the classifier.

Result: The proposed post-processing OSR method ranks in the top three on two evaluated wildlife datasets, demonstrating consistent cross-dataset performance. It achieves AUROC scores of 93.41 on African animals and 95.35 on Swedish animals, indicating strong separation between known and unknown samples.

Conclusion: A simple, training-free post-processing strategy—relating NCM-based feature distances to logit probabilities—provides effective open-set detection in wildlife classification, with robust cross-dataset performance and competitive AUROC metrics compared to SOTA methods.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

### [139] [Exploring The Missing Semantics In Event Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17347)
*Jingqian Wu,Shengpeng Xu,Yunbo Jia,Edmund Y. Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-E2VID introduces cross-modal and semantic-aware mechanisms to infuse frame-level semantics (via SAM) into event-to-video reconstruction, achieving higher frame quality than existing E2V methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras capture only intensity changes, missing static and semantic information, which hampers reconstruction quality. Incorporating robust semantic knowledge from frame-based models can improve event-to-video reconstruction.

Method: 1) Cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) to transfer SAM-based semantic features to the event encoder and align high-level features across modalities. 2) Semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF) to fuse frame-modality semantics into event representations for decoding. 3) Semantic perceptual supervision using SAM-generated categorical labels to supervise semantic reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show that Semantic-E2VID significantly improves frame quality and outperforms state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks; code is provided in supplementary material.

Conclusion: Leveraging frame-domain semantics via cross-modal alignment and semantic supervision is effective for E2V tasks, enabling richer semantic reconstruction and higher-quality frames.

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

### [140] [Recurrent Attention-based Token Selection for Efficient Streaming Video-LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17364)
*Vaggelis Dorovatas,Soroush Seifi,Gunshi Gupta,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for streaming Video-LLMs that selects attended visual tokens, recurrently integrates past selections for temporal coherence, and uses caption-based QA to deliver efficient, accurate responses, achieving state-of-the-art streaming performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video understanding requires timely responses and online processing. Existing Video-LLMs rely on full-video access, which is inefficient; there is a need to identify and process only the tokens the model attends to. A training-free, token-selective approach can improve efficiency while preserving accuracy.

Method: 1) Use LLM-informed visual token selection to keep only the tokens the LLM attends to, discarding up to ~95% of unimportant tokens. 2) Recurrently process past selected tokens to maintain temporal coherence across clips. 3) Use caption-based question answering for lightweight, accurate responses. The approach is training-free and compatible with standard Video-LLMs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on streaming video benchmarks while balancing efficiency and effectiveness, with substantial reduction in visual tokens and minimal loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: A training-free, token-selective streaming framework for Video-LLMs can provide state-of-the-art performance efficiently, by focusing computation on attended visual tokens, maintaining temporal coherence, and employing lightweight caption-based QA.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

### [141] [Beyond Real Faces: Synthetic Datasets Can Achieve Reliable Recognition Performance without Privacy Compromise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17372)
*Paweł Borsukiewicz,Fadi Boutros,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Charles Beumier,Wendkûuni C. Ouedraogo,Jacques Klein,Tegawendé F. Bissyandé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic facial data can rival real datasets for recognition performance while offering privacy controls and bias mitigation; top synthetic datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) approach or exceed real data benchmarks; a seven-criterion evaluation shows promising viability and ethical benefits; 25 datasets identified (2018-2025) with 10M+ synthetic samples analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and legal concerns surrounding real-face datasets under regulations like GDPR by empirically assessing whether synthetic facial data can replace real data in recognition tasks.

Method: Systematic literature review of synthetic facial recognition datasets (2018-2025) combined with rigorous experimental validation. Seven privacy-preserving criteria were evaluated: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and benchmark reliability. Experiments used over 10 million synthetic samples and compared results to five standard benchmarks.

Result: Best-performing synthetic datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieved recognition accuracies of 95.67% and 94.91%, surpassing the real CASIA-WebFace benchmark (94.70%). Publicly available synthetic options Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) closely follow. Synthetic data exhibited adequate intra-class variability and maintained identity separability. Demographic bias analysis indicated limited biases and revealed strong potential for bias mitigation through generation parameters.

Conclusion: Synthetic facial data is a scientifically viable and ethically favorable alternative for facial recognition research, enabling privacy-preserving data usage and controllable bias mitigation without substantial loss in performance.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

### [142] [Facial Expression-based Parkinson's Disease Severity Diagnosis via Feature Fusion and Adaptive Class Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17373)
*Yintao Zhou,Wei Huang,Zhengyu Li,Jing Huang,Meng Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an attention-based multi-expression facial feature fusion with adaptive class balancing to diagnose Parkinson's disease severity, addressing single-expression bias and data imbalance with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease severity diagnosis is important for early detection and tailored interventions. Facial-expression-based diagnosis leverages the masked-face symptom but current methods often rely on a single expression type, ignore inter-stage class imbalance, and primarily target binary PD/non-PD diagnosis rather than severity levels.

Method: Introduce a facial expression–based method that integrates multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion. Employ an adaptive class-balancing strategy that dynamically adjusts the training contribution of samples based on class distribution and classification difficulty.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate promising performance and validate the efficacy of both attention-based feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves PD severity diagnosis by leveraging multi-expression features with intelligent fusion and balancing, addressing expression-type bias and data imbalance, with potential for more accurate and clinically useful severity assessment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

### [143] [Closed-Loop Transfer for Weakly-supervised Affordance Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17384)
*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Ge Zheng,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoopTrans introduces a closed-loop, dual-direction knowledge transfer framework for weakly-supervised affordance grounding, enabling simultaneous exocentric-to-egocentric transfer and egocentric-to-exocentric enhancement via unified cross-modal localization and denoising knowledge distillation; it improves localization and handles occlusion in both image and video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on unidirectional transfer from exocentric to egocentric data, which limits learning in complex interactions and occlusion scenarios. A closed-loop framework could leverage bidirectional feedback to refine affordance grounding across modalities.

Method: LoopTrans couples exocentric (interaction-centered) and egocentric (object-centered) images in a unified cross-modal localization framework and applies denoising knowledge distillation to bridge domain gaps. It enables bidirectional knowledge transfer (exocentric→egocentric and egocentric→exocentric) to iteratively improve affordance localization even when parts of the interaction region are occluded.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements across image and video benchmarks on all metrics, including challenging conditions where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human body.

Conclusion: A closed-loop, bidirectional transfer framework like LoopTrans effectively enhances weakly-supervised affordance grounding by simultaneously improving both domains and leveraging feedback to refine knowledge extraction beyond prior one-way methods.

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

*Dmitrii Galimzianov,Viacheslav Vyshegorodtsev,Ivan Nezhivykh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prototype vision-based system for monitoring stalled horses using detection (YOLOv11) and tracking (BoT-SORT) to detect five horse/people-related events, aided by a dataset annotated with CLIP and GroundingDINO, evaluated qualitatively with reliable horse-event detection but limited by people detection due to data scarcity; supports real-time welfare monitoring in stables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and accelerate monitoring of stalled horses to enable early health and welfare issue detection, reducing manual labor and improving stable management.

Method: Detect and track horses and people with YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT. Infer event states from object trajectories and spatial relations within stalls. Build a custom dataset annotated with CLIP and GroundingDINO. Consider camera blind spots and classify five event types.

Result: Qualitative evaluation shows reliable performance for horse-related events; limitations in detecting people due to data scarcity. Demonstrates feasibility of real-time behavioral monitoring in equine facilities and lays groundwork for welfare-oriented stable management.

Conclusion: Presents a foundational system for real-time equine behavioral monitoring, with potential to improve welfare assessments and stall management; future work should address data scarcity for people detection and expand event types and robustness.

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

### [145] [DeepDetect: Learning All-in-One Dense Keypoints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17422)
*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepDetect is an all-in-one dense keypoint detector that fuses traditional cues via multi-detector masks and trains ESPNet to produce semantically-aware, dense keypoints, improving density, repeatability, and matching on varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of classic and learning-based detectors—sensitivity to photometric changes, low keypoint density, poor repeatability, lack of semantic focus—and to produce dense, semantically meaningful keypoints that are robust across challenging scenes.

Method: Create ground-truth masks by fusing outputs from 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors to capture diverse cues. Train a lightweight ESPNet using these masks as labels to generate densely distributed, semantically-guided keypoints. Evaluate on Oxford Affine Covariant Regions (ACR) dataset.

Result: Maximum values achieved: average keypoint density 0.5143, average repeatability 0.9582, and 59,003 correct matches.

Conclusion: DeepDetect leverages the strengths of classical detectors within a deep-learning framework to produce dense, robust, and semantically-informed keypoints, improving matching under diverse and degraded conditions.

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

*Julien Zouein,Hossein Javidnia,François Pitié,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Repurposes AV1 motion vectors to create dense, sub-pixel correspondences for compressed-domain SfM front-ends, achieving competitive accuracy at lower CPU cost and enabling scalable reconstruction on short videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and increase density of correspondences for structure-from-motion by exploiting motion vectors from modern video codecs, enabling more scalable pipelines without full-feature extraction.

Method: Extract AV1 motion vectors, convert them into dense sub-pixel correspondences; filter short tracks using cosine consistency; benchmark against sequential SIFT on short videos; perform a small SfM/Ba pipeline on a 117-frame clip to evaluate registerability, point density, reprojection error, and BA time as a function of match density.

Result: The compressed-domain front end matches or approaches SIFT performance on short videos with substantially lower CPU usage, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. In a 117-frame SfM demo, MV-based matches register all images and reconstruct 0.46–0.62M points with reprojection error around 0.51–0.53 px; Bundle Adjustment time increases with match density.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain correspondences provide a practical, resource-efficient front end with clear potential for scaling to full pipelines.

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

### [147] [Rethinking Nighttime Image Deraining via Learnable Color Space Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17440)
*Qiyuan Guan,Xiang Chen,Guiyue Jin,Jiyu Jin,Shumin Fan,Tianyu Song,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces HQ-NightRain, a high-quality nighttime rain benchmark, and CST-Net, a rain removal model that uses a learnable color space converter and implicit illumination guidance to better remove rain in the Y channel, showing improved performance and robustness on nighttime scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nighttime deraining is more challenging due to complex lighting and the lack of datasets that properly capture the interaction between rain and illumination. A high-quality, realistic dataset and a model tailored to nighttime color and illumination cues are needed.

Method: Proposes HQ-NightRain dataset and a Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net). CST-Net includes a learnable color space converter (CSC) to enable more effective rain removal in the Y channel, and incorporates implicit illumination guidance to guide feature learning under challenging lighting. The model is evaluated on the new dataset with extensive experiments, and code and data are released.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the value of the new HQ-NightRain dataset and the effectiveness of CST-Net in nighttime deraining, showing improved robustness and performance in complex scenes.

Conclusion: The paper contributes both a high-quality nighttime rain dataset and a tailored deraining network that leverages a learnable color space transformation and illumination-aware guidance, advancing the state of nighttime image deraining and providing resources for future research.

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

### [148] [Initialize to Generalize: A Stronger Initialization Pipeline for Sparse-View 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17479)
*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Initialization is the key bottleneck for sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS); the paper proposes a SfM-based seed augmentation strategy plus self-initialization and point-cloud regularization to extend sparse-view performance, yielding consistent gains on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view 3DGS tends to overfit to training viewpoints, causing artifacts like blur in novel views. Prior work focuses on improving initialization or applying training-time regularization, but ablations show initialization largely determines the achievable performance, with regularization offering only modest gains at extra cost.

Method: 1) frequency-aware SfM: improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences. 2) 3DGS self-initialization: adds photometric supervision to generate additional Gaussian centers beyond SfM. 3) point-cloud regularization: enforces multi-view consistency and uniform spatial coverage using simple geometric/visibility priors.

Result: The approach yields consistent gains in sparse-view scenarios on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360, establishing the proposed initialization strategy as stronger than prior methods.

Conclusion: Initialization plays a decisive role in sparse-view 3DGS; enhancing initialization (via frequency-aware SfM, self-initialization, and regularization) outperforms training-time constraints, and the proposed pipeline provides a clean, reliable seed point cloud with improved sparse-view rendering.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

### [149] [SparseWorld: A Flexible, Adaptive, and Efficient 4D Occupancy World Model Powered by Sparse and Dynamic Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17482)
*Chenxu Dang,Haiyan Liu,Guangjun Bao,Pei An,Xinyue Tang,Jie Ma,Bingchuan Sun,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseWorld introduces a flexible 4D occupancy model using sparse, dynamic queries to achieve extended-range perception, regression-based forecasting, and a temporal-aware training strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing occupancy models rely on static grids and in-place classification, which limits perception flexibility and misaligns with the dynamic, continuous nature of real scenes.

Method: Proposes Range-Adaptive Perception with learnable queries modulated by ego state and temporal-spatial links; State-Conditioned Forecasting using regression-guided dynamics; Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training for smooth/efficient learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks; thorough ablations and visualizations validate the benefits of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency.

Conclusion: SparseWorld offers a scalable, adaptive, and efficient 4D occupancy framework that better handles dynamics via sparse queries; code released.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

### [150] [Split-Fuse-Transport: Annotation-Free Saliency via Dual Clustering and Optimal Transport Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17484)
*Muhammad Umer Ramzan,Ali Zia,Abdelwahed Khamis,Noman Ali,Usman Ali,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POTNet introduces an entropy-guided dual-clustering and OT alignment to generate sharp pseudo-masks for unsupervised SOD, enabling an end-to-end AutoSOD pipeline that outperforms prior unsupervised and weakly supervised methods and narrows the gap to fully supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Salient object detection aims for high accuracy without pixel-level labels, but existing prototype-based methods struggle due to boundary/interior geometry differences and underutilized global consistency from optimal transport (OT). Reliable pseudo-masks are needed to approach supervised performance.

Method: Replace POT's single k-means step with a dual-clustering head: high-entropy pixels are grouped by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means; align the resulting prototypes with OT. The split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single forward pass, supervised by a MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder in an end-to-end AutoSOD pipeline.

Result: On five benchmarks, AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, while improving training efficiency and narrowing the gap to fully supervised models.

Conclusion: The split-fuse-transport POTNet design demonstrates that reliable, geometry-aware pseudo-masks combined with OT alignment can enable near-supervised SOD in an end-to-end unsupervised pipeline, reducing reliance on handcrafted priors and enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

### [151] [Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17501)
*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework for zero-shot video summarization using LLMs; converts limited ground-truth into pseudo labels and dataset-adaptive rubrics to score segments, achieving strong zero-shot results on SumMe and TVSum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High labeling costs and weak cross-dataset generalization in supervised methods; limitations of unsupervised and prior zero-shot approaches in capturing high-level semantics and narrative cues.

Method: Convert a small subset of ground-truth annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels; aggregate into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics for interpretable scene evaluation. During inference, score first/last segments from descriptions; score intermediate segments using brief contextual summaries of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and reduce redundancy. Use prompting to guide LLMs to balance local salience and global coherence without extra parameter tuning.

Result: On SumMe and TVSum, achieved F1 scores of 57.58 and 63.05, outperforming unsupervised and prior zero-shot baselines and approaching supervised performance.

Conclusion: Rubric-guided pseudo labeling stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video summarization.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Four-pillar training framework for large-scale video generation (MUG-V 10B) achieving competitive SOTA performance and open-sourcing Megatron-Core-based training/inference stack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the heavy resource demands and modeling challenges of large-scale video generation—such as cross-modal text-video alignment, long spatiotemporal sequences, and complex dependencies—by delivering an efficient, scalable training framework and open-source stack.

Method: Propose a four-pillar framework (data processing, model architecture, training strategy, infrastructure) with improvements in data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training; implement using Megatron-Core; scale to 10B parameters; release full stack publicly.

Result: MUG-V 10B matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall; surpasses leading open-source baselines on e-commerce-oriented video tasks in human evaluations; demonstrates near-linear multi-node scaling and high training efficiency.

Conclusion: This work delivers a reproducible, open-source, Megatron-Core–based solution for large-scale video generation, enabling efficient training and deployment and marking the first public release of such a codebase for video generation.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

*Yovin Yahathugoda,Davide Prezzi,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Vicky Goh,Sebastien Ourselin,Michela Antonelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation (MambaX-Net) for longitudinal prostate MRI in active surveillance, leveraging previous time points and pseudo-labels to improve segmentation with limited labels, outperforming U-Net and Transformer baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In longitudinal active surveillance of prostate cancer, multiple time points and scarce expert labels impede effective segmentation. Existing single-time-point models fail to exploit temporal evolution and struggle with limited/noisy data. A method that uses prior-time information and semi-supervised learning can enable robust, automated segmentation for monitoring disease progression.

Method: MambaX-Net is a dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the current-time segmentation using the current MRI and the previous time-point segmentation. It introduces: (1) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module that fuses temporal and long-range spatial dependencies; (2) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined delineation; and (3) a semi-supervised self-training strategy that uses pseudo-labels from a pre-trained nnU-Net to learn from unlabeled data. The model is evaluated on a longitudinal dataset of patients under active surveillance for prostate cancer.

Result: On a longitudinal active-surveillance MRI dataset, MambaX-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained with limited and noisy labels.

Conclusion: MambaX-Net enables robust, efficient longitudinal prostate segmentation in AS by integrating temporal information, anatomical priors, and semi-supervised learning, addressing data scarcity and label noise while improving accuracy over existing architectures.

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

### [154] [WP-CrackNet: A Collaborative Adversarial Learning Framework for End-to-End Weakly-Supervised Road Crack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17566)
*Nachuan Ma,Zhengfei Song,Qiang Hu,Xiaoyu Tang,Chengxi Zhang,Rui Fan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised, end-to-end framework (WP-CrackNet) for pixel-level road crack detection using only image-level labels, integrating CAM-based classification, a feature reconstructor, and a detector, enhanced by path-aware attention (PAAM) and center-enhanced CAM consistency (CECCM) to produce accurate crack maps and pseudo-labels; achieves competitive to supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods on three image-level datasets; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level crack annotations are expensive and time-consuming; scalable, annotation-efficient road crack detection is needed for smart-city infrastructure maintenance.

Method: WP-CrackNet consists of a classifier generating CAMs, a reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing pixel-wise crack maps. The classifier and reconstructor are trained adversarially to expand CAM coverage. PAAM fuses high-level and low-level cues via spatial and channel-wise dependencies. CECCM refines CAMs with center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints to create better pseudo-labels. Training uses pseudo-labels from post-processed CAMs; experiments on three image-level datasets.

Result: WP-CrackNet achieves comparable performance to supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised approaches for road crack detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances scalable, annotation-efficient road inspection by enabling accurate pixel-wise crack detection from image-level labels, with publicly available code and datasets.

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

*Kaichen Zhou,Yuhan Wang,Grace Chen,Xinhai Chang,Gaspard Beaudouin,Fangneng Zhan,Paul Pu Liang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGE-4D is a dynamics-aware feedforward extension of VGGT that decouples static and dynamic information to jointly estimate camera pose, depth, and dense point clouds in dynamic scenes without post-processing, outperforming the static VGGT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D feed-forward models are trained on static scenes and struggle with dynamic elements (e.g., moving humans, deformable objects). There is a need for a method that robustly handles dynamics while delivering multi-task 4D reconstruction.

Method: Introduce a dynamics-aware aggregator that predicts a dynamics-aware mask to suppress motion cues for pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction, thereby disentangling static and dynamic information.

Result: PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in dynamic scenarios, achieving superior camera pose estimation, monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction, without post-processing.

Conclusion: The dynamics-aware approach enables robust, multi-task 4D reconstruction in dynamic scenes by resolving the pose-geometry trade-off and extending VGGT to non-static environments.

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

*Chuhong Wang,Hua Li,Chongyi Li,Huazhong Liu,Xiongxin Tang,Sam Kwong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UCIS4K, the first underwater camouflaged instance segmentation dataset (3,953 images with instance annotations), and UCIS-SAM, an SAM-based network with CBOM, FDTIM, and MFFAM that achieves state-of-the-art results on UCIS4K and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater scenes suffer from color distortion, low contrast, and blur, making camouflaged instance segmentation particularly challenging. Existing terrestrial-dominated datasets and methods do not generalize well to underwater environments, necessitating a dedicated dataset and specialized network design.

Method: Proposes UCIS-SAM built on Segment Anything Model. Key components are: (1) Channel Balance Optimization Module (CBOM) to enhance underwater feature learning by correcting channel characteristics; (2) Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) to emphasize intrinsic object features and suppress camouflage patterns; (3) Multi-scale Feature Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) to reinforce boundaries of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands.

Result: Empirical evaluations on UCIS4K and public benchmarks show that UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules in underwater camouflage segmentation.

Conclusion: UCIS-SAM with the UCIS4K dataset advances underwater camouflaged instance segmentation, providing a new benchmark and a modular architecture that specifically addresses color distortion, low contrast, and camouflage interference.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeCraft introduces Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) and a multi-agent LLM framework to transform natural language into structured, textured, and interactive 3D assets via procedural modeling and painting, outperforming prior LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome unstructured meshes and low interactivity in text-to-3D systems, enabling accurate spatial/semantic control and artist-friendly workflows.

Method: Proposes GPS graph representation that decomposes input into sub-tasks; uses hierarchical LLM agents to initialize GPS and iteratively refine procedural modeling and painting; outputs structured shape programs for 3D assets; supports animation and user editing.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show superior geometric accuracy and semantic richness versus existing LLM-based agents; demonstrations of animation and user-customized editing; shows broad interactive applicability.

Conclusion: GPS-based ShapeCraft provides structured, interactive, and semantically faithful 3D generation from natural language, with potential for broader interactive applications; demonstrates improved performance and adaptability.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework that automates 3D point cloud segmentation from UAV scans by leveraging BIM-synthetic data to reduce labeling effort, achieving high accuracy on railroad tracks and speeding up training with smaller datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of 3D infrastructure scans is time-consuming and error-prone. Combining real UAV data with BIM-generated synthetic data aims to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency, enabling scalable structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Method: A machine learning-based segmentation framework that fuses real UAV-scanned point clouds with BIM-synthetic point clouds to train robust models, reducing reliance on manual labeling and accelerating training via smaller datasets supplemented with BIM data.

Result: Validated on a railroad track dataset, achieving high accuracy in segmenting major components such as rails and crossties. Using BIM-supplemented, smaller datasets reduced training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The approach enhances precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure model segmentation and advances UAV–BIM integration for structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

*Jia Guo,Shuai Lu,Lei Fan,Zelin Li,Donglin Di,Yang Song,Weihang Zhang,Wenbing Zhu,Hong Yan,Fang Chen,Huiqi Li,Hongen Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Dinomaly2, a unified, minimalistic framework for full-spectrum unsupervised image anomaly detection across 2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR modalities and task settings, achieving state-of-the-art results with a five-element, reconstruction-based approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection has progressed to unified multi-class models but still underperforms one-for-one counterparts and is fragmented into highly specialized methods, creating deployment barriers. There is a need for a universal, scalable solution that works across data types and tasks.

Method: Dinomaly2 uses the orchestration of five simple elements within a standard reconstruction-based framework, guided by a 'less is more' philosophy. The design is intended to extend naturally across diverse modalities and task settings without modification, aiming for universal applicability.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks show full-spectrum superiority across modalities (2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class, inference-unified multi-class, few-shot), and application domains. Notable results include 99.9% image-level AUROC on MVTec-AD and 99.3% on VisA for the multi-class model; state-of-the-art performance with minimal adaptations in multi-view/multi-modal inspection; with only 8 normal examples per class, surpassing previous full-shot models (98.7% and 97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA).

Conclusion: Dinomaly2 provides a universal, scalable, minimalistic solution for full-spectrum image UAD, bridging performance gaps among multi-class models and enabling deployment across diverse real-world tasks and modalities; the authors advocate that simplicity underpins universality.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

### [160] [CaMiT: A Time-Aware Car Model Dataset for Classification and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17626)
*Frédéric LIN,Biruk Abere Ambaw,Adrian Popescu,Hejer Ammar,Romaric Audigier,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT introduces a large fine-grained, temporally annotated car model dataset to study temporal adaptation; static pretraining is competitive with generalist models but degrades across years; proposes two continual-learning strategies—time-incremental pretraining (update backbone) and time-incremental classifier learning (update only final layer)—to improve temporal robustness, plus time-aware generation leveraging temporal metadata; CaMiT serves as a benchmark for temporal adaptation in fine-grained vision and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objects change appearance over time and across domains; standard static datasets can underprepare models for temporal drift. This work seeks to quantify and mitigate temporal degradation in fine-grained recognition and generation, offering a dataset and methods as a benchmark for temporal adaptation.

Method: CaMiT dataset: 787k labeled samples across 190 car models (years 2007–2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005–2023); supports supervised and self-supervised learning. Compare static pretraining on in-domain data to large generalist models. Propose time-incremental learning strategies: (1) time-incremental pretraining (update backbone) and (2) time-incremental classifier learning (update only final layer). Evaluate across-year robustness. Extend to time-aware image generation leveraging temporal metadata during training.

Result: Static in-domain pretraining achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient but suffers accuracy drop when tested on data from different years. Time-incremental pretraining and time-incremental classifier learning both improve temporal robustness. Time-aware image generation using temporal metadata yields more realistic outputs.

Conclusion: CaMiT provides a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained recognition and generation, and the proposed time-aware learning strategies offer practical gains in temporal robustness when dealing with evolving artifact appearances.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

### [161] [Self-supervised Pre-training for Mapping of Archaeological Stone Wall in Historic Landscapes Using High-Resolution DEM Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17644)
*Zexian Huang,Mashnoon Islam,Brian Armstrong,Kourosh Khoshelham,Martin Tomko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-CV is a self-supervised cross-view pre-training framework for segmenting low-lying dry-stone walls from high-resolution DEMs, addressing vegetation occlusion and labeled-data scarcity; it attains 68.6% mean IoU and 63.8% IoU with only 10% labels, and supports ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping dry-stone walls is vital for heritage preservation and wildfire management in Australia, but occlusion by dense vegetation and scarcity of labeled data hinder manual and supervised mapping; DEM-based, structural cues offer a solution when combined with self-supervised learning.

Method: DINO-CV employs a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on knowledge distillation, learning invariant visual and geometric representations from multiple DEM derivatives to map low-lying walls; it is compatible with various backbones (ResNet, Wide ResNet, ViT).

Result: Applied to Budj Bim, it identifies a dense collection of colonial dry-stone walls and achieves a mean IoU of 68.6% on test areas, dropping to 63.8% IoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM derivatives enables automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated, heritage-rich environments with scarce annotations and generalizes across backbone architectures.

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

### [162] [Frugal Federated Learning for Violence Detection: A Comparison of LoRA-Tuned VLMs and Personalized CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17651)
*Sébastien Thuau,Siba Haidar,Ayush Bajracharya,Rachid Chelouah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frugal federated violence detection: compare zero-shot/federated fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs) with a lightweight, personalized CNN3D. Both approaches achieve >90% accuracy; CNN3D is more energy-efficient and sometimes better on ROC AUC and log loss, while VLMs excel at contextual, multimodal reasoning. A hybrid approach—use lightweight CNNs for routine tasks and activate VLMs selectively for complex/descriptive cases—offers a sustainable baseline for resource-aware video surveillance, with quantified energy and CO2 metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address resource constraints and environmental impact in federated video surveillance, and comparatively evaluate two frugal strategies (LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs) under realistic non-IID settings.

Method: Evaluate two complementary strategies for violence detection under federated learning: (1) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning of a vision-language model (LLaVA-7B) and (2) personalized training of a compact 65.8M CNN3D. Assess accuracy, calibration, ROC AUC, log loss, energy usage, and CO2 emissions in non-IID settings; analyze sustainability trade-offs and potential deployment implications.

Result: Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outruns LoRA-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss while consuming less energy. VLMs provide better contextual/multimodal inference. The study opportunistically quantifies energy/CO2 across training and inference, framing sustainability trade-offs. A hybrid model is recommended: lightweight CNNs for routine classification with selective VLM activation for complex scenarios; establishes a reproducible baseline for resource-aware AI in surveillance.

Conclusion: Suggest a hybrid architecture combining lightweight CNNs for everyday violence detection with selective VLM usage for descriptive or context-rich cases. Emphasize reproducibility and energy-aware deployment, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-oriented systems.

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

### [163] [4DSegStreamer: Streaming 4D Panoptic Segmentation via Dual Threads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17664)
*Ling Liu,Jun Tian,Li Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer introduces a dual-thread streaming framework for real-time 4D panoptic segmentation, predicting future dynamics while ensuring timely inference, and showing robustness across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In highly dynamic, streaming environments (e.g., crowd evacuation, autonomous driving), real-time, fine-grained perception within a fixed time budget is essential, motivating robust streaming 4D segmentation techniques.

Method: A Dual-Thread System with a predictive thread that leverages historical motion and geometry to forecast future dynamics, and an inference thread that aligns with the latest memory and compensates for ego-motion and object movements; the framework is designed to be general and integrable with existing 3D/4D segmentation pipelines.

Result: Evaluations on indoor HOI4D and outdoor SemanticKITTI and nuScenes demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting dynamic objects in complex scenes and enhanced robustness, especially at high frame rates, confirming real-time capability.

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer enables real-time, robust 4D panoptic segmentation in streaming settings and can be readily integrated into existing perception systems to enhance dynamic-object prediction.

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

### [164] [PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17681)
*Yuandong Pu,Le Zhuo,Songhao Han,Jinbo Xing,Kaiwen Zhu,Shuo Cao,Bin Fu,Si Liu,Hongsheng Li,Yu Qiao,Wenlong Zhang,Xi Chen,Yihao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark suite (PICABench) and evaluation protocol (PICAEval) assess physical realism in image editing across eight sub-dimensions, plus a video-derived physics dataset (PICA-100K); results indicate physical realism remains challenging, aiming to spur physically consistent editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current editing models prioritize instruction completion but neglect physical effects (shadows, reflections, interactions); a standardized benchmark is needed to measure progress toward physically realistic editing.

Method: Define eight sub-dimensions spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions for common edits (add, remove, attribute change, etc.); use PICAEval with VLM-as-a-judge plus region-level human annotations and questions; learn physics from videos; construct PICA-100K for training; evaluate mainstream models.

Result: Physical realism is still challenging; there is substantial room for improvement; the benchmark/framework provides a foundation for advancing toward physically consistent realism.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and dataset are intended to move the field from naive content editing toward physically realistic editing and to guide future research.

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

### [165] [Intelligent Communication Mixture-of-Experts Boosted-Medical Image Segmentation Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17684)
*Xinwei Zhang,Hu Chen,Zhe Yuan,Sukun Tian,Peng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC-MoE is a mixture-of-experts framework for medical image segmentation foundation models that enhances high-level feature representation with semantic and adaptive experts, uses pixel-probability adaptive voting to fuse outputs while preserving pretrained weights, and adopts semantic-guided contrastive learning to address weak supervision; it achieves state-of-the-art results and generalizes well across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models excel in general tasks, but fine-tuning them for medical image segmentation often lacks high-level feature richness and can disrupt pretrained weight integrity. There is a need for methods that boost high-level representations without breaking the pretrained structure.

Method: Introduce three kinds of experts—basic, semantic, and adaptive—within a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Apply a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy to select and fuse expert outputs based on label consistency and load balancing. Propose semantic-guided contrastive learning to improve high-level feature representations under weak supervision while preserving pretrained weights. Evaluate on three public medical image segmentation datasets.

Result: IC-MoE outperforms state-of-the-art models on three public medical image segmentation datasets and demonstrates strong generalizability across diverse segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: IC-MoE successfully supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with enhanced high-level features while maintaining the structural integrity of pretrained weights, achieving superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

*Min Cao,Xinyu Zhou,Ding Jiang,Bo Du,Mang Ye,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Bi-IRRA for multilingual Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) that uses bidirectional implicit relation reasoning and a multi-dimensional global alignment to bridge language and modality gaps, establishing new state-of-the-art on multilingual TIPR datasets and providing a refined multilingual benchmark with available code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modality heterogeneity between text and images and the language bias of existing TIPR methods. Prior global or local alignment strategies either miss fine-grained cross-modal differences or rely on explicit part alignments, and most work is English-centric. The work introduces a multilingual TIPR benchmark and a cross-language cross-modal framework to overcome these limitations.

Method: Propose Bi-IRRA (Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning). It comprises: (1) a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module that predicts masked image and text in both directions to implicitly model local cross-modal-language relations, and (2) a multi-dimensional global alignment module to bridge modality heterogeneity. The multilingual TIPR benchmark is created by translating descriptions with large language models and refining them with domain-specific knowledge.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on all multilingual TIPR datasets. Provides data and code at the specified GitHub repository, enabling replication and further research.

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA effectively learns cross-language and cross-modal alignment, addressing the limitations of prior methods and establishing a strong multilingual TIPR baseline while contributing a practical benchmark and resources for the community.

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in

*Taichi Liu,Zhenyu Wang,Ruofeng Liu,Guang Wang,Desheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OP3Det is a class-agnostic, prompt-free 3D detector for open-world object discovery that leverages 2D semantic priors, 3D geometric priors, and a cross-modal mixture-of-experts to detect all objects in 3D scenes, outperforming existing methods (up to 16.0% AR vs open-world detectors; 13.5% vs closed-world).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world 3D objectness is underexplored and current closed-set 3D detectors fail to generalize to novel objects. Incorporating open-vocabulary 3D models faces vocabulary expansion and semantic overlap issues. There is a need for a class-agnostic, prompt-free approach that can leverage rich priors.

Method: Propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic, open-world, prompt-free 3D detector. It uses 2D foundation models to supply semantic priors and 3D geometric priors to generate class-agnostic proposals. A cross-modal mixture of experts fuses point cloud and RGB features, dynamically routing uni-modal and multi-modal information to learn generalized 3D objectness without handcrafted prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show OP3Det significantly surpasses existing open-world 3D detectors (up to 16.0% improvement in AR) and outperforms closed-world detectors by 13.5%.

Conclusion: OP3Det demonstrates effective generalized 3D object discovery in open-world settings without relying on prompts, leveraging cross-modal priors and a dynamic mixture-of-experts to broaden 3D object discovery and demonstrate strong generalization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

### [168] [GAS: Improving Discretization of Diffusion ODEs via Generalized Adversarial Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17699)
*Aleksandr Oganov,Ilya Bykov,Eva Neudachina,Mishan Aliev,Alexander Tolmachev,Alexander Sidorov,Aleksandr Zuev,Andrey Okhotin,Denis Rakitin,Aibek Alanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generalized Solver (GAS) is a simple, training-trick-free parameterization of the ODE diffusion sampler that reduces sampling cost while preserving fine details; combining the distillation loss with adversarial training yields the Generalized Adversarial Solver, which outperforms existing solvers under similar resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce high-quality samples but are expensive to sample from. Prior gradient-based distillation methods reduce steps but rely on complex training tricks and often miss fine details; there is a need for a simpler, detail-preserving solver with low resource usage.

Method: Introduce the Generalized Solver as a parameterization of the ODE sampler requiring no extra training tricks. Train by combining the original distillation loss with adversarial training to mitigate artifacts and improve detail fidelity, yielding the Generalized Adversarial Solver (GAS).

Result: Empirical results show GAS outperforms existing solver training methods under similar resource constraints, with improved detail fidelity and fewer artifacts; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: GAS provides a simple yet effective approach to distillation-based diffusion sampling that enhances detail preservation when reducing the number of function evaluations, and the adversarial extension further boosts quality; implementation available online.

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

*Walter Simoncini,Michael Dorkenwald,Tijmen Blankevoort,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SnapViT enables retraining-free, post-pretraining pruning of Vision Transformers to support elastic inference across a continuum of compute budgets, using gradient-informed pruning and cross-network structure correlations approximated via an evolutionary Hessian approach; it requires no labels and trains quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models are powerful but come in fixed, predefined sizes, which forces sub-optimal deployment under real-world compute constraints. There is a need for a retraining-free, self-supervised pruning method that yields elastic models adaptable to any budget and can work without a classification head.

Method: Post-pretraining structured pruning (SnapViT) that combines gradient information with cross-network structure correlations. The cross-network correlations are approximated via an evolutionary algorithm to estimate Hessian off-diagonal structures. The method is retraining-free, self-supervised (no labels), works on models without a classification head, and is fast (≤ minutes on a single A100). It yields elastic models by pruning pretrained Vision Transformers without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical results on DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg show superior performance compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods across various sparsities. The approach generates elastic models in under five minutes on a single A100 GPU, enabling deployment at any desired computational budget. The method generalizes across different Vision Transformer models and does not require labeled data or retraining.

Conclusion: SnapViT provides an efficient, retraining-free pruning framework for pretrained Vision Transformers, delivering elastic inference across budgets. It introduces an evolutionary approximation of Hessian off-diagonal structures and a self-supervised importance scoring mechanism, achieving strong performance with minimal compute. Code and pruned models are available to practitioners.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or
labels. Code and pruned models are available at: https://elastic.ashita.nl/

### [170] [Improving Cross-Patient Generalization in Parkinson's Disease Detection through Chunk-Based Analysis of Hand-Drawn Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17703)
*Mhd Adnan Albani,Riad Sonbol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage Parkinson's detection method from hand-drawn images using 2x2 image chunking and ensemble fusion, achieving high accuracy on seen and unseen patients on NewHandPD, addressing data scarcity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key limitations in prior work: small datasets and poor robustness to unseen patients in PD handwriting detection; propose a chunking-based multi-chunk approach to augment information and stabilize predictions, improving generalization.

Method: Stage 1 classifies drawing type (circle, meander, spiral). Stage 2 extracts features from each 2x2 chunk and detects PD; images are divided into 2x2 chunks; chunk-level predictions are merged via an ensemble to produce final decision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art, showing 97.08% accuracy on seen patients and 94.91% on unseen patients on NewHandPD, with a remaining gap of 2.17 percentage points between seen and unseen, substantially smaller than the 4.76-point drop in prior work.

Conclusion: The chunking strategy and ensemble aggregation improve data scarcity handling and robustness to unseen data, yielding strong PD detection performance on hand-drawn images; suggests potential for better generalization in clinical datasets.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in

### [171] [Automatic Classification of Circulating Blood Cell Clusters based on Multi-channel Flow Cytometry Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17716)
*Suqiang Ma,Subhadeep Sengupta,Yao Lee,Beikang Gu,Xianyan Chen,Xianqiao Wang,Yang Liu,Mengjia Xu,Galit H. Frydman,He Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-step framework for analyzing circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) in flow cytometry images: (1) classify images as cluster vs non-cluster using a fine-tuned YOLOv11 (outperforms traditional CNNs and ViT); (2) identify cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from multi-channel fluorescence stains, robust to debris and staining artifacts; achieves >95% accuracy in both clustering and phenotyping, with potential broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circulating CCCs containing RBCs, WBCs, and platelets are important biomarkers for thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Current analysis largely focuses on single cells; there is a lack of automated tools to analyze CCC images. CCCs have irregular shapes and heterogeneous cell composition requiring multi-channel staining for accurate phenotyping, motivating a specialized framework.

Method: A two-step strategy: (1) categorize images into cluster vs non-cluster by fine-tuning YOLOv11, which outperforms conventional CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT); (2) identify cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from multi-channel fluorescence stains, leveraging both bright-field and fluorescence data to improve accuracy and reduce impact of debris/staining artifacts.

Result: The approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster classification and phenotype identification.

Conclusion: The automated CCC image analysis framework effectively analyzes flow cytometry images, initially demonstrated on blood cells, with potential to extend to immune and tumor cell clusters, facilitating cellular research across various diseases.

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

### [172] [Raindrop GS: A Benchmark for 3D Gaussian Splatting under Raindrop Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17719)
*Zhiqiang Teng,Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Zifeng Yuan,Xuanyi Li,Xuanyu Zhang,Shunli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaindropGS provides a real-world, raindrop-corrupted 3D Gaussian Splatting benchmark that evaluates the full reconstruction pipeline from unconstrained rain images to clean 3DGS outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS benchmarks rely on synthetic, pose-known, constrained images; real raindrops hinder camera pose estimation and point cloud initialization, causing a domain gap and degraded reconstructions. There is a need to evaluate and improve the entire pipeline under real raindrop conditions.

Method: Proposes RaindropGS with three components: data preparation, data processing, raindrop-aware 3DGS evaluation. Includes data collection of real-world scenes with three aligned image sets (raindrop-focused, background-focused, rain-free ground truth). Evaluates several factors: raindrop interference types, camera pose estimation, point cloud initialization, single-image rain removal, and 3D Gaussian training; analyzes how camera focus position and inaccurate pose/initialization affect reconstruction.

Result: Comprehensive experiments reveal limitations of current 3DGS methods under unconstrained raindrop images; identify critical influences of focus, pose, and initialization; provide insights and benchmarks to guide robust development.

Conclusion: RaindropGS establishes a realistic evaluation framework and highlights directions for robust 3DGS under raindrop contamination, including improved rain removal, more reliable pose estimation, and training strategies aligned with unconstrained raindrop data.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MT-Video-Bench: a six-competency, 987-dialogue benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn video dialogues; reveals notable gaps across state-of-the-art models; to be publicly released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks largely cover single-turn Q&A and fail to capture the complexities of multi-turn, interactive video understanding in real-world scenarios; there is a need for holistic evaluation of MLLMs in dialogue.

Method: Designed MT-Video-Bench with six core competencies focusing on perceptivity and interactivity; curated 987 multi-turn dialogues across diverse domains (e.g., sports analysis, video-based tutoring); evaluated multiple open-source and closed-source MLLMs to assess capabilities and limitations in multi-turn video dialogues.

Result: The evaluation uncovers significant performance gaps and limitations in current MLLMs when handling multi-turn video dialogues; models vary widely in their multi-turn capabilities.

Conclusion: MT-Video-Bench provides a comprehensive, publicly available benchmark to drive future research and improve MLLMs’ performance in real-world, multi-turn video-dialogue tasks.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

### [174] [Signature Forgery Detection: Improving Cross-Dataset Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17724)
*Matheus Ramos Parracho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-dataset generalization for offline signature verification is explored using two pipelines (raw images vs shell preprocessing) across three benchmarks (CEDAR, ICDAR, GPDS Synthetic). Raw-image models outperform shell preprocessing, but no approach is definitively superior; shell preprocessing shows promise for future robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Signature forgery detection suffers from domain shift across datasets due to handwriting variation and acquisition differences. Improving cross-dataset generalization is crucial for reliable real-world deployment in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation.

Method: Two experimental pipelines: (1) raw signature image-based feature learning and (2) shell preprocessing-based feature learning. Models trained on one dataset are evaluated on others. Datasets used: CEDAR, ICDAR, GPDS Synthetic. The study analyzes behavioral patterns and cross-domain performance.

Result: Raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks. Shell-based model did not surpass raw but showed promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain verification.

Conclusion: There is no definitive superiority between the two pipelines. Cross-domain generalization in offline signature verification remains challenging, with raw-image features currently more effective but shell preprocessing offering a viable direction for future improvements.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

*Aaron Appelle,Jerome P. Lynch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion Transformer–based image-to-video models conditioned on pedestrian keyframes can generate plausible pedestrian trajectories; evaluation uses dynamics-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage world-modeling learned from large-scale video data to forecast pedestrian movements in crowds by guiding I2V models with keyframe conditioning.

Method: Condition DiT-based I2V models on keyframes extracted from pedestrian trajectory benchmarks, generate trajectories/videos, and evaluate trajectory prediction with quantitative measures of pedestrian dynamics (speed, spacing, flow, continuity).

Result: Demonstrates that the framework can produce realistic pedestrian movement patterns and yields measurable trajectory-prediction performance under keyframe conditioning, indicating transfer of diffusion-model world modeling to trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: Shows promise of diffusion-transformer I2V models for pedestrian trajectory forecasting when guided by structured keyframes, highlighting the potential of large-video pretraining for dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent high-performing image-to-video (I2V) models based on variants of the
diffusion transformer (DiT) have displayed remarkable inherent world-modeling
capabilities by virtue of training on large scale video datasets. We
investigate whether these models can generate realistic pedestrian movement
patterns in crowded public scenes. Our framework conditions I2V models on
keyframes extracted from pedestrian trajectory benchmarks, then evaluates their
trajectory prediction performance using quantitative measures of pedestrian
dynamics.

*Timur Ismagilov,Shakaiba Majeed,Michael Milford,Tan Viet Tuyen Nguyen,Sarvapali D. Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, descriptor-agnostic multi-reference VPR method uses matrix decomposition to fuse multiple reference descriptors into basis representations for projection-based residual matching, plus a new SotonMV benchmark; achieves substantial gains in Recall@1 under appearance and viewpoint changes and remains lightweight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based VPR improves robustness but at high training and deployment costs; descriptor-level fusion methods are often heuristic and limited, especially under appearance and viewpoint changes. A training-free, general approach that effectively fuses multiple references is desirable.

Method: Jointly model multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. Introduces SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. The approach is descriptor-agnostic and training-free.

Result: On multi-appearance data, Recall@1 improves by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes; ~5% gains on unstructured data. Demonstrates strong generalisation and remains lightweight.

Conclusion: A practical, scalable solution for multi-reference VPR that does not require training, generalises across conditions, and benefits from a structured multi-viewpoint benchmark (SotonMV) for evaluation.

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

### [177] [Towards Explainable Skin Cancer Classification: A Dual-Network Attention Model with Lesion Segmentation and Clinical Metadata Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17773)
*Md. Enamul Atiq,Shaikh Anowarul Fattah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-encoder, attention-based framework using lesion segmentation and patient metadata improves skin lesion classification, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation and interpretable predictions via Grad-CAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve both accuracy and interpretability in automated dermoscopic skin cancer diagnosis by integrating precise lesion segmentation, cross-attention-based feature fusion, and clinical metadata.

Method: A Deep-UNet with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and ASPP for segmentation; two DenseNet201 encoders (original image and segmented lesion) with multi-head cross-attention for feature fusion; a transformer module incorporates metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into prediction; Grad-CAM used for explanations.

Result: State-of-the-art segmentation on HAM10000 and ISIC 2018/2019; significant improvements in classification accuracy and average AUC over baselines; Grad-CAM heatmaps validate lesion-focused predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical metadata with attention-based fusion yields a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

### [178] [SparseVILA: Decoupling Visual Sparsity for Efficient VLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17777)
*Samir Khaki,Junxian Guo,Jiaming Tang,Shang Yang,Yukang Chen,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,Yao Lu,Song Han,Zhijian Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVILA introduces decoupled visual sparsity for efficient vision-language model inference by pruning redundant tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during decoding. This yields substantial speedups (4.0x prefill, 2.5x decoding, 2.6x end-to-end) on long-context video tasks and improved accuracy on document understanding and reasoning, all in a training-free, architecture-agnostic framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs scale, the number of visual tokens dominates inference latency, hindering real-time/high-context applications across high-res images, long videos, and multi-turn chats. Existing pruning methods are often coupled to the entire inference pass and may degrade fidelity over turns. There is a need to decouple and specialize sparsity across stages to maintain multi-turn fidelity while achieving efficiency.

Method: SparseVILA decouples sparsity across two stages. During prefill it prunes query-agnostic, redundant visual tokens to reduce initial cache generation. During decoding it retrieves only tokens relevant to the current query, leveraging a mostly preserved visual cache. This decoupled approach aligns with strong prefill pruning methods while preserving multi-turn fidelity. The pipeline is AWQ-optimized and architecture-agnostic, enabling training-free acceleration.

Result: Achieves up to 4.0x faster prefill, 2.5x faster decoding, and 2.6x end-to-end speedup on long-context video tasks; also improves accuracy on document-understanding and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Decoupling query-agnostic pruning from query-aware retrieval provides a new direction for efficient multimodal inference, enabling training-free, architecture-agnostic acceleration of large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

*Yuhao Yang,Zhen Yang,Zi-Yi Dou,Anh Nguyen,Keen You,Omar Attia,Andrew Szot,Michael Feng,Ram Ramrakhya,Alexander Toshev,Chao Huang,Yinfei Yang,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA is a foundation model that unifies GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls, trained via a four-part pipeline to deliver faster, more reliable computer-use actions than traditional GUI-only agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computer-use agents rely on primitive GUI actions (clicks, typing, scrolling) that require precise visual grounding and long action sequences, leading to cascading failures and bottlenecks; they lack access to APIs, MCP servers, and tools, limiting capability and efficiency.

Method: Four-component approach: (1) automated pipeline to scale programmatic tools from documentation, open-source repos, and code generation; (2) synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) large-scale hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level tool calls; (4) two-stage training with supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions.

Result: Experiments on OSWorld with 7B and 32B models show ~22% relative improvement over base models and ~11% faster in terms of steps; out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena yields 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data; the hybrid action mechanism reduces error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Conclusion: The hybrid action mechanism is critical for improving efficiency and robustness, enabling effective cross-domain computer-use with fewer cascading errors and better performance than GUI-only or API-only agents.

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

### [180] [Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17800)
*Jiale Cheng,Yusen Liu,Xinyu Zhang,Yulin Fei,Wenyi Hong,Ruiliang Lyu,Weihan Wang,Zhe Su,Xiaotao Gu,Xiao Liu,Yushi Bai,Jie Tang,Hongning Wang,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Glyph renders long texts as images and processes them with vision-language models to compress input while preserving semantics, enabling long-context LLM-like tasks with 3-4x token compression and significant speedups; an LLM-driven genetic search optimizes visual rendering configurations; scales to 1M-token tasks under extreme compression; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context windows in LLMs incur prohibitive compute/memory costs as context length grows. Extending token-based contexts to the million-token scale is impractical. The authors propose a visual-rendering approach to compress textual input without losing essential semantics, aiming to enable longer effective contexts with existing or modestly larger models.

Method: Render long texts into images using Glyph; apply vision-language models (VLMs) to extract semantic information; employ an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal rendering configurations that balance accuracy and compression; evaluate on long-context benchmarks; compare against strong LLM baselines (e.g., Qwen3-8B); report token compression, speedups, and downstream task performance.

Result: Achieves 3-4x token compression with accuracy comparable to leading LLMs on long-context benchmarks; about 4x faster prefilling/decoding and ~2x faster SFT training; under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM can handle 1M-token-level tasks; rendered data also improves performance in real-world multimodal tasks such as document understanding; code and model released at the project page.

Conclusion: Visual rendering of long texts into images via Glyph is a viable alternative to token-window expansion for long-context processing. It yields substantial compression and speedups while preserving accuracy, enabling extremely long contexts and benefiting downstream multimodal tasks. The approach is complementary to token-based methods and could reshape how long-context reasoning is handled in practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

### [181] [ConsistEdit: Highly Consistent and Precise Training-free Visual Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17803)
*Zixin Yin,Ling-Hao Chen,Lionel Ni,Xili Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConsistEdit is a training-free attention-control method for MM-DiT that enables consistent, prompt-aligned text-guided edits across all inference steps and attention layers, enabling robust multi-round and multi-region image/video editing with progressive control over structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free editing methods often trade editing strength for source consistency, struggle with cumulative errors in multi-round/video editing, and enforce global consistency that hampers fine-grained attribute changes. MM-DiT’s attention mechanisms offer potential, but require a specialized control strategy to achieve reliable, fine-grained edits.

Method: Propose ConsistEdit with three components: vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of query, key, and value tokens. The approach operates across all inference steps and attention layers, is handcraft-free, and supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits in image and video editing.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios, with robust multi-round and multi-region editing. It is the first method to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly improving reliability and consistency and enabling progressive control over structural changes.

Conclusion: ConsistEdit provides reliable, fine-grained, and scalable control for text-guided editing in MM-DiT, enabling robust multi-round and video editing with improved consistency and the ability to progressively adjust structural alignment across all inference steps and attention layers.

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

### [182] [VisuoAlign: Safety Alignment of LVLMs with Multimodal Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15948)
*MingSheng Li,Guangze Zhao,Sichen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VisuoAlign introduces a prompt-guided tree search framework to enforce safety in LVLMs by weaving safety constraints into visual-text reasoning, using Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate diverse safety-promoting prompt trajectories and prompt-based scaling for real-time risk detection and compliant responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguarding LVLMs against multimodal threats is harder than text-only models due to new attack surfaces, lack of safety supervision in multimodal reasoning, and degradation of alignment when modalities are fused; there is a need for proactive risk exposure and scalable safety tooling in multimodal settings.

Method: Embed safety constraints into the reasoning loop via visual-textual interactive prompts; use Monte Carlo Tree Search to systematically explore diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories; employ prompt-based scaling to enable real-time risk detection and generation of compliant responses.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively reveals risks, supports dataset generation for safety evaluation, and significantly improves LVLM robustness against complex cross-modal threats.

Conclusion: VisuoAlign offers a proactive, scalable approach to multi-modal safety alignment by integrating safety prompts into reasoning via MCTS and scalable risk detection, enhancing robustness of LVLMs against cross-modal attacks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

### [183] [Executable Epistemology: The Structured Cognitive Loop as an Architecture of Intentional Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15952)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), an executable epistemology framework for emergent intelligence, arguing architecture over monolithic prompts and redefining intelligence as a loop-based epistemic process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding; there is a gap in epistemic architecture. The paper advocates an epistemological (not ontological) framing and aims to operationalize philosophy into computable cognition.

Method: Defines SCL as a loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. Grounded in process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory. Operationalizes philosophical insights into computational structures to enable executable epistemology. Demonstrates that functional separation in architecture yields coherent, interpretable behavior. Redefines intelligence as the capacity to reconstruct its epistemic state.

Result: Evidence from agent evaluations suggesting that modular, separated architectural components yield more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt-based systems; demonstrates executable epistemology and a shift from mere representational accuracy to reconstructing epistemic state.

Conclusion: SCL advances philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI by enabling enacted theories, grounding behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity, and framing knowledge as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. It argues for cognitive principles to be realized structurally rather than through larger models.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

### [184] [Exploring the Potential of Citiverses for Regulatory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15959)
*Isabelle Hupont,Marisa Ponti,Sven Schade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A science-for-policy agenda for citiverses as experimentation spaces to advance regulatory learning, based on expert consultation; outlines research areas, experimental topics, and integration steps with test beds, living labs, and regulatory sandboxes, while stressing ethics and broader ecosystem considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance regulatory learning and policy experimentation by using immersive citiverse environments to explore policy scenarios and technologies, addressing regulatory challenges in digital governance and cross-border contexts, with an emphasis on responsible innovation.

Method: Consultative synthesis from a high-level expert panel (policymakers, national science advisers, and digital regulation researchers) and related literature to identify key research areas, experimental topics, and integration pathways for citiverses within broader regulatory experimentation ecosystems.

Result: Identification of core research areas (scalability, real-time feedback, complexity modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation, ethical considerations, integration of emerging technologies), proposed experimental topics across transport, urban planning, and environment/climate, and a framework for integrating citiverses into test beds, living labs, and regulatory sandboxes.

Conclusion: Citiverses hold promise for regulatory learning but require careful, responsible development. Future research should pursue ethical, economic, ecological, and social dimensions and establish concrete steps for integrating citiverses into broader experimentation ecosystems.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader
ecosystems of experimentation spaces, including test beds, living labs and
regulatory sandboxes

### [185] [PISA: A Pragmatic Psych-Inspired Unified Memory System for Enhanced AI Agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15966)
*Shian Jia,Ziyang Huang,Xinbo Wang,Haofei Zhang,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PISA is a Piaget-inspired unified memory system for AI that uses tri-modal schema adaptation and a hybrid symbolic-neural retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art adaptability and long-term knowledge retention on LOCOMO and AggQA benchmarks for data analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI memory often lacks task adaptability and understates memory's constructive, task-oriented role; a psychologically grounded, adaptive memory could improve continual learning and cross-task performance.

Method: Introduce trimodal adaptation: schema updation, schema evolution, schema creation; develop schema-grounded structures; implement a hybrid memory access architecture combining symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval; evaluate on LOCOMO and the newly proposed AggQA benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art adaptability and long-term knowledge retention, with improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency on the tested benchmarks.

Conclusion: A memory system grounded in cognitive development theory can be both constructive and adaptive, enabling continuous learning and better performance through coordinated schema management and hybrid retrieval.

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

*Chris Su,Harrison Li,Matheus Marques,George Flint,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Providing an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi shows that letting an LLM act and justify moves does not prevent the observed reasoning-collapse with increasing task complexity; the model diverges from both optimal and random policies, suggesting mode-like behavior that depends on the solution mode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether the perceived reasoning-collapse in large reasoning models is due to the model's internal state-tracking burden or intrinsic limitations in reasoning, by giving the model an external environment to manipulate and observe state.

Method: An LLM is given an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi: it makes moves via tool calls, outputs written justification, observes resulting state, and can reprompt itself for subsequent moves. The study analyzes the resulting policy behavior by comparing it to optimal and uniformly random policies across complexity levels.

Result: Access to an environment interface does not remove or delay the performance collapse. Policy analysis shows increasing divergence from both optimal and random policies, indicating mode-like collapse at each level of complexity; performance is sensitive to whether the selected mode aligns with the correct solution.

Conclusion:  The observed mode-like collapse may be a general feature of LRMs; simply providing an external environment to interact with does not solve the core reasoning bottlenecks, prompting a reevaluation of how we assess and interpret reasoning in LRMs.

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

### [187] [Cognitive Load Traces as Symbolic and Visual Accounts of Deep Model Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15980)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Cognitive Load Traces (CLTs) as a mid-level interpretability framework that models model-internal resource allocation via intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load, using proxies like attention entropy and KV-cache miss ratio; provides visualizations and achieves 15-30% efficiency gains with maintained accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap between low-level metrics and high-level explanations by grounding model reasoning dynamics in cognitive load theory, enabling interpretable, temporally resolved insights and interventions.

Method: CLTs are defined as a three-component stochastic process (IL_t, EL_t, GL_t) representing Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies (e.g., attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, decoding stability). The work provides symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) for interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics.

Result: Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30% while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: CLTs offer a tractable, interpretable view of reasoning dynamics, enabling targeted interventions and providing a bridge between cognitive psychology and deep model interpretability.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

### [188] [ProofFlow: A Dependency Graph Approach to Faithful Proof Autoformalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15981)
*Rafael Cabral,Tuan Manh Do,Xuejun Yu,Wai Ming Tai,Zijin Feng,Xin Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProofFlow introduces a DAG-based, lemma-centered autoformalization pipeline that prioritizes preserving the structure of mathematical arguments over raw executable translation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a new 184-problem benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoformalization approaches often produce executable code but fail to preserve the semantic meaning and logical dependencies of human-written proofs. A structure-aware method is needed to maintain justification flow and argument structure.

Method: Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of logical dependencies among proof steps. Formalize each step as an intermediate lemma using a lemma-based approach to retain the argument’s logical structure. Create a 184-problem undergraduate benchmark with step-by-step solutions and dependency graphs. Propose ProofScore, a composite metric capturing syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity.

Result: Achieves ProofScore of 0.545, a new state-of-the-art, substantially higher than baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123) and step-proof formalization (0.072). Open-sourced the pipeline, benchmark, and metric at the cited repository.

Conclusion: ProofFlow advances autoformalization by prioritizing structural fidelity, delivering superior evaluation on a curated benchmark, and providing resources to spur further progress in the field.

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

*Sarah Rebecca Ondraszek,Jörg Waitelonis,Katja Keller,Claudia Niessner,Anna M. Jacyszyn,Harald Sack*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an ontology-based knowledge graph for MO|RE motor performance data to standardize modeling and sharing across studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interoperable, machine-readable representations of motor performance data across populations and studies, facilitating comparisons and data reuse.

Method: Develop an ontology anchored in the Basic Formal Ontology; design a knowledge graph linking plan specifications, processes, and measurements; align with the MO|RE data publication framework and the DiTraRe initiative.

Result: A conceptual framework and roadmap for constructing a knowledge graph from MO|RE data; no empirical results reported yet.

Conclusion: This vision aims to transform data modeling and sharing for motor performance research, enabling standardized, interoperable datasets and improved cross-study analyses.

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

### [190] [A Non-overlap-based Conflict Measure for Random Permutation Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16001)
*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a conflict measure for random permutation sets (RPS) by combining a rank-biased, non-overlap approach, linking RPST with DST and RFS; provides a top-weighted, tunable framework for order-aware uncertainty fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty reasoning that incorporates order information requires new conflict metrics for permutation-based evidence. The paper treats RPST as an extension of DST and seeks robust, tunable measures of conflict to guide information fusion.

Method: Define an inconsistency measure between permutations inspired by rank-biased overlap (RBO); develop a non-overlap-based conflict measure for RPS; analyze RPST as a DST extension; illustrate with numerical examples; highlight top-weightedness and user-controlled weights, parameters, and truncation depths.

Result: The proposed conflict measure exhibits natural top-weightedness and effectively captures conflict between RPSs from the DST perspective; it offers flexible control over weights, parameters, and truncation depths, demonstrated through numerical examples.

Conclusion: RPST extends DST to ordered evidence, providing a practical framework for measuring conflict with tunable emphasis on top-ranked elements and depths, aiding decision-makers in order-aware information fusion.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

*Andreas Radler,Vincent Seyfried,Stefan Pirker,Johannes Brandstetter,Thomas Lichtenegger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAINT trains a generative model to predict the distribution of system states in parallel across time, yielding on-trajectory predictions from sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable neural twins that stay close to the true system state over time and support context-specific decisions; autoregressive surrogates often drift off-trajectory.

Method: An architecture-agnostic PAINT framework that learns a time-parallel generative model of state distributions; uses sliding-window predictions at test time; provides theoretical guarantee of on-trajectory behavior; validated on a 2D turbulent fluid dynamics task.

Result: PAINT maintains trajectory fidelity (on-trajectory) and achieves high-fidelity state estimates from sparse measurements, outperforming baselines in the tested turbulent-fluid scenario.

Conclusion: PAINT demonstrates the potential of neural twins to stay on-trajectory, enabling accurate state estimation and decision-making in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

### [192] [Global-focal Adaptation with Information Separation for Noise-robust Transfer Fault Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16033)
*Junyu Ren,Wensheng Gan,Guangyu Zhang,Wei Zhong,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ISGFAN is a robust cross-domain fault diagnosis framework that separates useful fault information from noise and domain-specific variations, using a global-focal adversarial scheme to align distributions; it outperforms baselines on three benchmarks with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial fault diagnosis suffers from severe noise and domain shifts, and existing transfer methods assume clean data or strong domain similarity, limiting real-world effectiveness.

Method: An information separation architecture with improved orthogonal loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representations. It combines adversarial learning with a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme: a focal component mitigates category-specific transfer issues caused by noise in unsupervised settings, while a global domain classifier aligns the overall distribution.

Result: Empirical evaluations on three public benchmark datasets show that ISGFAN outperforms prominent existing approaches, demonstrating robustness to noise and better cross-domain transfer. The authors provide the data and code at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: ISGFAN offers a robust solution for cross-domain fault diagnosis under noisy conditions by separating information to reduce noise influence and aligning both conditional and marginal distributions; it achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets and comes with publicly available code.

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code

*Ioan Hedea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid offline constraint-programming with online temporal-network execution for robust, deadline-feasible scheduling under bounded uncertainty; achieves zero deadline violations in benchmarks with modest makespan overhead and is scalable to medium-size problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic schedules fail when task durations deviate due to noise, variability, and human factors. There is a need for schedules that remain feasible under uncertainty and hard deadlines, balancing proactive buffering with dynamic robustness.

Method: Build a constraint-programming model of a flexible job-shop with per-job deadlines and compute an optimal buffer Delta* to create a proactive baseline. Convert the plan to a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability to enable a real-time dispatcher to retime activities under bounded duration realizations without violating constraints. Evaluate via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the Kacem benchmark suite.

Result: The hybrid approach eliminates 100% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, with only 3–5% overhead on makespan. Solve times for CP and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-sized instances; demonstrates scalability and robustness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temporal-network reasoning effectively bridges proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, enabling self-correcting factories and bringing closer industry adoption of robust, deadline-driven scheduling.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

*Dou Liu,Ying Long,Sophia Zuoqiu,Di Liu,Kang Li,Yiting Lin,Hanyi Liu,Rong Yin,Tian Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Selective Few-shot prompting markedly improves LLM-generated clinical Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) versus zero-shot or random few-shot, driven by Gold-Standard Depth and Representative Diversity; human expert evaluation remains essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in clinical CoT generation and assess the reliability of LLM-generated CoTs; identify prompting strategies that enhance quality.

Method: Blinded comparative study with senior ART clinicians evaluating CoTs from Zero-shot, Random Few-shot, and Selective Few-shot strategies; comparison against GPT-4o; metrics include expert ratings and statistical significance (p<0.001).

Result: Selective Few-shot significantly outperforms other strategies across human-evaluation metrics; Random Few-shot offers no significant improvement over Zero-shot; AI evaluator failed to detect these differences; two principles—Gold-Standard Depth and Representative Diversity—explain the outcomes.

Conclusion: Strategic prompt curation is critical for trustworthy synthetic CoTs; proposes a Dual Principles framework to enable scalable, high-quality CoTs; underscores ongoing need for human expertise in evaluating high-stakes clinical AI.

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a measurable 'organizational knowledge' metric for corporations leveraging AI, linking AI-enabled information pipelines' cost and error rate to a knowledge predicate and firm-wide epistemic capacity, and maps these to legal concepts of knowledge and recklessness to create auditable artefacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corporate mens rea depends on human agents; AI-mediated decision-making challenges this. A formal, measurable approach is needed for accountability in the algorithmic age.

Method: Develops a theory of extended cognition; defines a continuous knowledge metric S_S(φ) combining computational cost and validated error rate; introduces a thresholded knowledge predicate K_S and a firm-wide epistemic capacity index K_{S,t}; provides an operational mapping to actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and recklessness.

Result: A formal framework and audit artefacts enabling measurable epistemic states in corporations using AI, facilitating justificable accountability.

Conclusion: This work lays a pathway toward measurable, justiciable corporate knowledge, making the corporate mind tractable and auditable as algorithms mediate decision-making.

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

### [196] [Towards Automatic Evaluation and Selection of PHI De-identification Models via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16194)
*Guanchen Wu,Zuhui Chen,Yuzhang Xie,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TEAM-PHI uses multiple autonomous Evaluation Agents and an LLM majority vote to automatically rank PHI de-identification models without heavy gold labels, achieving stable and aligned rankings with ground-truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PHI de-identification evaluation traditionally relies on costly expert annotations and gold labels; scalable, secure evaluation with limited ground-truth data is needed.

Method: Multiple Evaluation Agents independently judge PHI extraction correctness and output structured metrics; results are consolidated via an LLM-based majority voting mechanism to produce a single, stable ranking; evaluated on real-world clinical notes and compared to ground-truth/human evaluation.

Result: Evaluation shows consistent rankings across evaluators; LLM voting converges on the same top-performing systems; automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation and ground-truth/human assessments.

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective framework for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, reducing reliance on gold labels while delivering reproducible rankings.

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

### [197] [The Right to Be Remembered: Preserving Maximally Truthful Digital Memory in the Age of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16206)
*Alex Zhavoronkov,Dominika Wilczok,Roman Yampolskiy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-driven synthesis risks erasing minority perspectives and concentrating control; proposes Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) to minimize AI omissions, ensure fair treatment, and maximize truthfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the risk that AI-generated knowledge consolidates narratives, erases less digitally visible groups, and reshapes collective memory; seek a normative safeguard.

Method: Conceptual analysis and normative framework; define RTBR, identify omission mechanisms, and outline design principles for AI systems and information ecosystems.

Result: Introduces RTBR as a policy-level concept with guiding principles and implications for fairness, transparency, and recall; outlines steps to operationalize in future work.

Conclusion: RTBR offers a principled countermeasure to AI-induced memory bias, calling for further work to operationalize and enforce fair, truthful remembrance across platforms.

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

*Hanane Nour Moussa,Patrick Queiroz Da Silva,Daniel Adu-Ampratwum,Alyson East,Zitong Lu,Nikki Puccetti,Mingyi Xue,Huan Sun,Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScholarEval is a retrieval-augmented evaluation framework for ideas that leverages expert rubrics and a novel ScholarIdeas dataset to assess soundness and contribution, outperforming baselines and providing actionable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust, domain-agnostic evaluation of AI-generated research ideas to ensure empirical validity and true advancement, addressing gaps in current evaluators that may miss important dimensions or rely on opaque reasoning.

Method: Introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval-augmented evaluation framework; create ScholarIdeas, an expert-annotated multi-domain idea dataset (117 ideas across AI, neuroscience, biochemistry, ecology); evaluate coverage against human rubrics; compare to baselines (including o4-mini-deep-research); conduct large-scale user studies; release code, dataset, and tool.

Result: ScholarEval achieves higher coverage of rubric points than baselines; preferred over o4-mini-deep-research in actionability, depth, and evidence support; user study shows superior performance in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness.

Conclusion: ScholarEval offers a robust, practical approach for evaluating AI-generated research ideas across domains, with openly released resources to foster community adoption and further benchmarking.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

### [199] [Distractor Injection Attacks on Large Reasoning Models: Characterization and Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16259)
*Zhehao Zhang,Weijie Xu,Shixian Cui,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new vulnerability called reasoning distraction weakens large reasoning models by embedding irrelevant but complex distractors in prompts, significantly reducing accuracy. A defense using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data improves robustness by over 50 points; highlighting a critical safety risk and practical mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of large reasoning models as they perform complex tasks, by identifying and mitigating a novel prompt-induced vulnerability that can divert models from their primary objective.

Method: Systematically study LRMs across diverse models and benchmarks, inject complicated distractors into prompts, and measure performance degradation. Analyze how alignment techniques affect vulnerability and explore covert compliance with hidden adversarial instructions. Propose a defense by training on synthetic adversarial data using SFT and RL.

Result: Distractors can reduce task accuracy by up to 60%. Some alignment techniques may amplify the weakness. Models may exhibit covert compliance to hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning. The proposed defense (SFT+RL on synthetic adversarial data) improves robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks.

Conclusion: Reasoning distraction is a distinct, urgent threat to LRM reliability. A practical defense combining SFT and RL on synthetic adversarial data can substantially enhance robustness, contributing to safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

### [200] [What Limits Agentic Systems Efficiency?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16276)
*Song Bian,Minghao Yan,Anand Jayarajan,Gennady Pekhimenko,Shivaram Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study of efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic LLM systems and introduction of SpecCache, a caching framework with speculative execution, achieving large cache gains and reduced web overhead without harming performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic LLM systems with web interactions can improve reasoning but suffer from high latency and variability due to web environments. Reducing end-to-end latency is crucial for practicality.

Method: Empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to decompose end-to-end latency into LLM API latency and web environment latency; introduce SpecCache with speculative execution; evaluate on two standard benchmarks.

Result: Web environment latency can dominate up to 53.7% of end-to-end latency. SpecCache achieves up to 58x higher cache hit rate versus random caching and up to 3.2x reduction in web environment overhead, without degrading agentic performance.

Conclusion: Caching with speculative execution is an effective approach to alleviate web-related latency in web-interactive agentic LLM systems, improving practicality and responsiveness; potential for broader evaluation and deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

### [201] [DTKG: Dual-Track Knowledge Graph-Verified Reasoning Framework for Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16302)
*Changhao Wang,Yanfang Liu,Xinxin Fan,Anzhi Zhou,Lao Tian,Yunfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework (DTKG) for multi-hop QA that unifies parallel and chained reasoning to boost efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of using only LLM-based fact verification for parallel verification or KG-paths for chained reasoning, and to reduce redundant retrieval in parallel+chain tasks.

Method: Two-stage DTKG: Classification Stage and Branch Processing Stage, inspired by Dual Process Theory; integrates parallel fact-verification and KG path-based reasoning in a unified pipeline.

Result: Abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: Proposes a unified dual-track framework to address limitations in current multi-hop QA approaches; details and experiments are not provided in the excerpt.

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

TL;DR: MedRule-KG is a compact typed knowledge graph with a symbolic verifier that enforces interpretable mathematical rules in reasoning tasks, improving exact-match performance and eliminating rule violations on a FDA-derived benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce fluent reasoning but violate simple mathematical or logical constraints; a grounding framework with a verifier can enforce consistency.

Method: Build a compact typed knowledge graph encoding entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules; use a symbolic verifier to check predictions and apply minimal corrections; integrate grounding with LLMs.

Result: On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, EM improved from 0.767 to 0.900 with MedRule-KG grounding; adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM and eliminates all rule violations.

Conclusion: MedRule-KG offers a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning; supports ablations; code and data released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu,Zhen Yang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SELECT dynamically selects anchors for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models, using sibling-exclusive concepts and a two-stage evaluation to optimize erasure precision while preserving related concepts, achieving ~4s anchor mining per concept and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed anchors in existing erasure methods cause re-emergence and erosion of erased concepts. A causal tracing study reveals sensitivity to anchor choice and motivates a universal, adaptive anchor strategy; Sibling Exclusive Concepts are identified as a superior anchor class.

Method: Causal tracing to analyze anchor sensitivity; define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as optimal anchors; develop SELECT with two-stage evaluation: stage 1 discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure; stage 2 identifies boundary anchors to preserve related concepts; dynamic, universal anchor selection framework adaptable to various erasure frameworks.

Result: Empirical evaluations show SELECT outperforms existing baselines across key metrics and frameworks; anchor mining time ~4 seconds per concept, demonstrating efficiency and adaptability.

Conclusion: SELECT provides a universal, fast, and robust anchor selection solution for contextual erasure in diffusion models, overcoming limitations of fixed anchors and enabling reliable erasure across diverse methods.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

### [204] [The Burden of Interactive Alignment with Inconsistent Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16368)
*Ali Shirali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Stackelberg model shows alignment feasibility depends on foresight; a critical horizon exists, and small costly signals can reduce it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users with inconsistent preferences can steer engagement-driven algorithms toward their true interests, informing design of alignment remedies.

Method: Model user cognition as a two-system (System 2 vs System 1) process and analyze a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game between users and the algorithm; define alignment burden as minimum horizon.

Result: There is a critical horizon; sufficiently foresighted users align; less foresighted users align to algorithm's objective; horizon can be long; a small costly signal (e.g., an extra click) can substantially reduce the required horizon.

Conclusion: The framework explains alignment dynamics in engagement-driven systems and highlights remedies (signals) and their trade-offs for achieving alignment in Stackelberg equilibrium.

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

### [205] [Before you <think>, monitor: Implementing Flavell's metacognitive framework in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16374)
*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A three-phase Monitor-Generate-Verify system using Flavell's cognitive monitoring; on GSM8K, achieves 75.42% accuracy, higher than competing methods, with fewer attempts, but needs broader evaluation beyond arithmetic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies from two isolated reasoning paradigms—planning-focused but lacking feedback vs refinement-focused but blind to strategy—by grounding generation with upfront monitoring.

Method: Operationalizes Flavell's cognitive monitoring model within a Monitor-Generate-Verify framework as an iterative three-phase process and evaluates on GSM8K.

Result: GSM8K accuracy 75.42%; SELF-REFINE 68.44%; Self-Verification 67.07%. Fewer attempts 1.3 vs 2.0; inference cost increased by 27–37%.

Conclusion: Upfront monitoring can yield higher-quality initial solutions and reduce refinement needs; generalisability beyond arithmetic reasoning remains to be shown.

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM) for domain generalization that disentangles color, texture, and shape to model causal mechanisms, enabling better generalization and interpretability; claims superior performance over existing DG models; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional domain generalization relies on statistical associations and distortion-invariant representations, which may miss underlying causal mechanisms. There is a need to emulate human-like hierarchical processing and multi-level learning to capture fine-grained causal relations and improve robustness and transfer in dynamic environments.

Method: Introduce HSCM, a humanoid-inspired structural causal framework that mimics hierarchical human vision processing. It disentangles and reweights key image attributes (color, texture, shape) to capture causal mechanisms across domains. The approach emphasizes interpretability and principled causal reasoning, with theoretical and empirical evaluations and a public codebase.

Result: Empirical results show HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, indicating improved robustness and a more principled capture of causal relationships between image attributes and labels.

Conclusion: HSCM offers a principled, interpretable causal framework for domain generalization by leveraging human-like processing and attribute disentanglement to enhance transfer in dynamic environments; the authors provide code for replication.

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

*Ao Tian,Yunfeng Lu,Xinxin Fan,Changhao Wang,Lanzhi Zhou,Yeyao Zhang,Yanfang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes RGMem, a self-evolving, multi-scale memory framework for LLM agents that learns long-term user profiles via hierarchical coarse-graining inspired by renormalization group, addressing limits of finite context and shallow cross-session memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of finite context windows and static memory in LLMs, which hinder cross-session long-term user modeling and deep trait extraction from multi-turn dialogues. Current RAG and explicit memory focus on fact storage but miss latent preferences and behaviors necessary for persistent, personalized interactions.

Method: Introduce RGMem, a memory framework inspired by the renormalization group. It organizes dialogue history across multiple scales by extracting semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then performing hierarchical coarse-graining and rescaling to form a dynamically evolving user profile. Memory evolution is treated as multi-scale information compression and emergence, yielding high-level, accurate user profiles from noisy, microscopic interactions.

Result: Conceptual framework with no reported empirical results in the abstract. The paper outlines how memory can be evolved across scales to build robust user models.

Conclusion: The core innovation is treating memory evolution as a multi-scale process that enables long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents, producing high-level user profiles from noisy interactions.

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewSense uses LLMs, clustering, and expert evaluation to convert unstructured reviews into prescriptive business recommendations, bridging sentiment analysis and decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to translate customer reviews from unstructured text into actionable, business-facing guidance. Traditional AI focuses on predicting preferences rather than prescribing strategies, leaving a gap for decision-support that can drive growth and loyalty.

Method: An integrated pipeline that clusters reviews, adapts LLMs to generate prescriptive recommendations, and incorporates expert-driven evaluation to ensure alignment with business objectives. The approach identifies key trends, recurring issues, and specific concerns within sentiments to produce targeted actions.

Result: Preliminary manual evaluations indicate strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives, suggesting potential for data-informed decision-making; quantitative validation is not reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: The framework presents a novel shift in AI-driven sentiment analysis by delivering business-facing prescriptions from customer feedback, with potential to refine strategies and maximize impact.

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit strong reasoning in structured domains, but NP-hard problem solving remains underexplored. A scalable, verifiable RLVR training framework is needed to probe NP-hard reasoning capabilities, study scaling laws, and facilitate robust OOD generalization beyond narrow benchmarks.

Method: NP-ENGINE provides 10 tasks across five domains, each with (i) controllable instance generator, (ii) rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver for approximate ground truth, enabling scalable RLVR with hierarchical task difficulties. NP-BENCH is derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA for evaluation. QWEN2.5-7B-NP is trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, achieving strong performance relative to GPT-4o. The study also demonstrates OOD generalization to reasoning and non-reasoning tasks and analyzes the impact of task diversity on performance.

Result: QWEN2.5-7B-NP significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves state-of-the-art results with the same model size. RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA yields strong OOD generalization to reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. A clear scaling trend is observed: greater task diversity improves OOD generalization.

Conclusion: Task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM reasoning, providing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR and offering practical resources (framework, benchmark, models) for NP-hard problem solving and broader reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

*Eilene Tomkins-Flanagan,Connor Hanley,Mary A. Kelly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doug is a typed language with guaranteed polynomial-time halting, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture; its types are learnable via neural embeddings, and skill learning is framed as program synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate resource-bounded symbolic computation with neural learning, enabling learnable type systems and human-like skill acquisition, and to model mental representations in the brain.

Method: Encode Doug as an encoding of LLFPL; type encoding via slot–value HDM; term encoding via Lisp VSA; map neural embedding space to types; interpret types from near neural states; frame skill acquisition as program synthesis.

Result: The paper presents a theoretical framework and encoding strategy; no empirical results reported; anticipated gains in learnability and efficiency; foundational step toward modeling human-like skills.

Conclusion: Doug contributes a bridge between symbolic typing, neural representation, and skill learning, proposing a path to human-like learning pace and to modeling cognitive representations, warranting empirical validation.

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-based post-training (Urban-R1) aligns MLLMs to UGI via Group Relative Policy Optimization, reducing geospatial bias and boosting cross-region generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial bias and poor cross-region generalization in urban foundation models limit reliable urban intelligence; SFT and closed models yield regionally skewed predictions.

Method: Urban-R1 uses reinforcement learning-based post-training with Group Relative Policy Optimization to optimize reasoning across geographic groups; employs urban region profiling as a proxy task to derive measurable rewards from multimodal urban data.

Result: Experiments across diverse regions and tasks show effective reduction of geo-bias and improved cross-region generalization; Urban-R1 outperforms both SFT-trained and closed-source models.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning alignment is a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

TL;DR: BuildArena is a customizable, physics-grounded benchmark for evaluating language-driven engineering construction, featuring a 3D geometry library and baseline LLM workflows, tested on eight frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs have broad reasoning abilities but their construction competencies under real-world physical constraints are largely unevaluated; there is a need for a physics-aligned interactive benchmark to drive research in language-driven construction automation.

Method: (1) A highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth model comparison; (2) Extendable task design spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) A 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library to support construction from language; (4) A baseline LLM agentic workflow to evaluate diverse model capabilities.

Conclusion: BuildArena provides a flexible, physics-aligned benchmarking platform and tools to advance research in language-driven engineering construction automation, with a project page for ongoing development and access.

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM

*Ayush Chopra,Aman Sharma,Feroz Ahmad,Luca Muscariello,Vijoy Pandey,Ramesh Raskar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REP is a coordination protocol for multi-agent systems that shares not only decisions but sensitivity signals indicating how outcomes would change under environmental shifts, improving coordination over A2A across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent-communication protocols focus on messaging rather than coordination, leading to brittle collective behavior as agent populations grow. REP aims to enable faster, more stable alignment by broadcasting lightweight sensitivities and making coordination a protocol-level capability, with support for multimodal signals (e.g., from LLMs).

Method: Formalize the REP protocol specification by separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules; enable agents to propagate lightweight sensitivity signals through local networks; implement and evaluate REP across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies; benchmarks include Beer Game (supply chains), Movie Scheduling (preference aggregation in sparse networks), and Fishbanks (resource allocation).

Result: REP significantly improves coordination over A2A, with reported gains of 41% to 100% in coordination accuracy and efficiency; it robustly handles multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs and generalizes across different domains and network structures.

Conclusion: By elevating coordination to a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the Internet of Agents, enabling faster, more stable group outcomes across diverse domains and signals.

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

### [214] [Can Knowledge-Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation Really Retrieve What You Need?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16582)
*Junchi Yu,Yujie Liu,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphFlow introduces a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly optimize a KG retrieval policy and a flow estimator, enabling accurate and diverse knowledge retrieval from text-rich knowledge graphs for RAG. It achieves ~10% gains in hit rate and recall on the STaRK benchmark and generalizes to unseen KGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KG-based RAG often lags in retrieving accurate and diverse information from text-rich graphs due to reliance on expensive, process-level supervision signals; there is a need for efficient, robust retrieval policies that can adapt to real-world queries.

Method: GraphFlow uses a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly train a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow estimator factorizes the reward across intermediate retrieval states, guiding the policy to sample KG candidates proportionally to their reward and enabling exploration of high-quality regions of the KG.

Result: On the STaRK benchmark, GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines (including GPT-4o) by about 10% in hit rate and recall and shows strong generalization to unseen KGs.

Conclusion: GraphFlow provides an effective and robust framework for KG-RAG retrieval, reducing dependence on costly process supervision while delivering improved retrieval quality and generalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

### [215] [Uncertain Knowledge Graph Completion via Semi-Supervised Confidence Distribution Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16601)
*Tianxing Wu,Shutong Zhu,Jingting Wang,Ning Xu,Guilin Qi,Haofen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ssCDL: semi-supervised confidence distribution learning for UKG completion; transforms confidences into distributions, uses meta-learning to generate pseudo labels, rebalance and augment training, improving completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertain knowledge graphs have incomplete data and highly imbalanced triple confidences. This imbalance limits the learning of high-quality UKG embeddings and hampers completion performance.

Method: Convert each triple confidence into a confidence distribution to provide richer supervision. Train embeddings iteratively on labeled triples and unlabeled triples with pseudo labels generated by a meta-learning module to augment data and rebalance confidence distribution.

Result: ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two UKG datasets across evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Transforming confidences into distributions and leveraging semi-supervised pseudo labeling via meta-learning effectively addresses confidence imbalance and improves UKG completion, showing strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

*Xuan Zhang,Ruixiao Li,Zhijian Zhou,Long Li,Yulei Qin,Ke Li,Xing Sun,Xiaoyu Tan,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MERCI is a reinforcement learning method that adds count-based intrinsic rewards to LLM reasoning to promote exploration; uses a Coin Flipping Network to estimate pseudo counts and epistemic uncertainty; integrated with GRPO; yields richer reasoning chains and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs guided by RL struggle due to sparse task rewards and limited exploration; repetitive reasoning patterns hinder performance; principled intrinsic motivation can encourage diverse chain-of-thought and better solutions.

Method: Introduce MERCI: a policy optimization augmentation with a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) that estimates pseudo counts and epistemic uncertainty of reasoning trajectories; converts these into intrinsic rewards that promote novelty while preserving task rewards; can be integrated with RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: On complex reasoning benchmarks, MERCI yields richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions.

Conclusion: Targeted intrinsic motivation via count-based exploration makes exploration reliable for language model reasoning, suggesting intrinsic rewards can effectively guide LLM reasoning beyond sparse outcome rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Motivation: To synthesize emerging evidence on the impact of large-scale AI models in neuroscience, identify opportunities and challenges, and provide guidance for responsible research and clinical deployment.

Method: Narrative/systematic review of recent work across five neuroscience domains (neuroimaging/data processing, brain-computer interfaces/decoding, molecular/genomic modeling, clinical translational frameworks, and disease-specific applications), with emphasis on multimodal data integration, spatiotemporal interpretation, and translational pathways; includes discussion of evaluation frameworks, domain knowledge integration, and ethical considerations, plus a catalog of key datasets.

Result: Large-scale AI models enable end-to-end learning from raw neural data, facilitate multimodal data integration and spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and support translational clinical frameworks. The interaction between neuroscience and AI is reciprocal, with biologically informed constraints improving interpretability and efficiency. The review identifies strong promise along with important implementation considerations, including rigorous evaluation, domain knowledge integration, ethical guidelines, and curated datasets used to validate models.

Conclusion: The convergence of AI and neuroscience holds substantial promise for advancing understanding and clinical impact, but realizing this potential requires rigorous evaluation, careful incorporation of domain knowledge, robust ethical guidelines for clinical use, and systematic curation of diverse datasets to validate models across domains.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFL uses a four-agent, three-subtask framework to autonomously solve complex VRPs with self-contained code generation, achieving near-100% solution feasibility and competitive results against specialized algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based VRP solutions rely on external intervention and are prone to execution errors and low feasibility; there is a need for fully autonomous, trustworthy, end-to-end solving pipelines for complex VRPs.

Method: Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) decomposes the problem into three manageable subtasks and engages four specialized agents that coordinate to ensure cross-functional consistency and logical soundness; it extracts knowledge from raw inputs and generates self-contained code without handcrafted modules or external solvers.

Result: Evaluated on 60 complex VRPs spanning standard benchmarks and practical variants; AFL achieves performance close to meticulously designed algorithms and substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in code reliability and solution feasibility, with feasibility rates approaching 100%.

Conclusion: AFL demonstrates a general, trustworthy, and highly automated approach to solving complex VRPs, reducing the need for human intervention and showcasing broad applicability across diverse VRP variants.

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

TL;DR: Shifts from pipeline-based agent design to model-native agentic AI, powered by reinforcement learning, unifying planning, tool use, and memory within LLMs across languages, vision, and embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To articulate the paradigm shift toward model-native agentic AI and outline the mechanisms, applications, and future directions guiding this evolution.

Method: A comprehensive survey tracing the evolution of agentic capabilities—from externally scripted, pipeline architectures to end-to-end, learned behaviors embedded in model parameters; positions RL as the engine; analyzes planning, tool use, and memory; discusses major applications (Deep Research agent, GUI agent) and future trends (multi-agent collaboration, reflection).

Result: Provides a cohesive framework showing how planning, tool use, and memory become internalized capabilities within models, enabling a unified LLM+RL+Task approach across language, vision, and embodied domains, and clarifying the trajectory toward model-native agentic AI.

Conclusion: Agentic AI is poised to grow intelligence through experience, with evolving roles for system and model layers and expanding directions in multi-agent collaboration and reflection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey of RL-based agentic search for LLMs, detailing how reinforcement learning enables multi-step, plan-retrieve-reflect workflows in search environments; it categorizes approaches by function, optimization strategy, and optimization scope, summarizes methods/evaluations/applications, and discusses challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with static knowledge and factual hallucinations; traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is often single-turn and heuristic. RL-based agentic search promises adaptive, self-improving control of planning, retrieval, and reasoning to make LLMs more reliable and capable in real-time or domain-specific settings.

Method: The paper provides the first comprehensive overview of RL-based agentic search, organizing the field along three dimensions: (i) what RL is used for (functional roles), (ii) how RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii) where RL is applied (scope of optimization). It synthesizes representative methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and highlights open challenges and future directions; a repository is provided.

Result: First comprehensive survey of RL-based agentic search; clarifies the landscape, taxonomy, and components; highlights representative methods, benchmarks, and practical considerations for evaluating and deploying RL-driven agentic search systems.

Conclusion: RL-based agentic search is a promising path to more reliable, scalable LLM-guided information seeking, but realizing it in practice requires addressing challenges in reliability, efficiency, evaluation standards, and deployment. The authors call for continued research and provide a resource hub to spur progress.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Combine global-effect analyses with uncertainty analyses and local attributions. Evaluate explanations for consistency across surrogate models to diagnose surrogate adequacy. Applicable to continuous and categorical inputs and designed to support global and local XAI analyses. Demonstrated on two case studies: hybrid-electric aircraft design analysis and an agent-based urban segregation model.

Result: Surrogate model coupled with XAI enables exploration in seconds, reveals nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design/policy levers, and signals where surrogates require more data or different architectures.

Conclusion: The workflow addresses both cost and transparency concerns in simulation-based analysis by leveraging surrogate models and explainability tools. It supports extensive exploration, guides data collection and model refinement, and is validated across diverse complex-system applications.

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

*Wei Huang,Peining Li,Meiyu Liang,Xu Hou,Junping Du,Yingxia Shao,Guanhua Ye,Wu Liu,Kangkang Lu,Yang Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Efficiently completes multimodal knowledge graphs by compressing tokens and pruning attention in LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art MKGC performance with lower computation on FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MKGs are incomplete; MKGC with LLMs faces semantic noise from many image tokens, modality conflicts, and high inference cost; need an efficient approach to exploit multimodal signals without overburdening models.

Method: Proposes MVTC (Multi-view Visual Token Compressor) using multi-head attention to adaptively compress image tokens from textual and visual views. Adds an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant MLLM attention layers, with a linear projection to mitigate performance loss from pruning.

Result: On benchmark datasets FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG, ELMM achieves state-of-the-art MKGC performance while substantially reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: ELMM establishes a new efficient paradigm for multimodal KG completion by balancing accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical avenue for scalable MKGC with LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

*Siyin Wang,Wenyi Yu,Xianzhao Chen,Xiaohai Tian,Jun Zhang,Lu Lu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELL-SA is a novel end-to-end, full-duplex multimodal model (vision, text, speech, action) with a Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts (SA-MoE) routing modalities to specialized experts, enabling natural dialogue and action turn-taking, and achieving competitive results on speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks while enabling unique multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work addresses the need for truly interactive, human-like agents that perceive and generate across multiple modalities in real-time, including concurrent perception and action, to enable richer, more natural human–computer interaction and move toward artificial general intelligence.

Method: Proposes ELLSA, an end-to-end full-duplex model built on a Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts (SA-MoE) architecture. Each modality is routed to specialized experts and fused through a unified attention backbone, leveraging strong pre-trained components and enabling efficient integration and mitigation of modality interference. Supports joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation across vision, text, speech, and action.

Result: On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines while uniquely enabling advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded VQA, and action barge-ins.

Conclusion: ELLSA represents a meaningful step toward more natural, general interactive intelligence and contributes to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence; data, code, and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

*Shuo Han,Yukun Cao,Zezhong Ding,Zengyi Gao,S Kevin Zhou,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphVista is a unified framework that improves scalability and modality coordination for graph understanding by hierarchical retrieval (GraphRAG) and a planning agent that routes tasks to text or visual modalities, enabling large-scale graphs and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with input token limits and lack effective coordination between text and image modalities for graphs; scalable, topology-aware reasoning is needed.

Method: Introduce GraphVista with three components: (1) a light GraphRAG base that hierarchically retrieves task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, (2) a planning agent that selects the appropriate modality per task (text for simple property reasoning; visual for local/structurally complex reasoning grounded in topology), (3) integration that allows joint reasoning across modalities.

Result: Demonstrates scalability to graphs up to 200x larger than existing benchmarks and achieves up to 4.4x quality improvement over state-of-the-art baselines by leveraging both modalities.

Conclusion: GraphVista effectively addresses scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding, offering a scalable, modality-aware framework that outperforms existing single-modality and fusion approaches.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

### [225] [Domain-Contextualized Concept Graphs: A Computable Framework for Knowledge Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16802)
*Chao Li,Yuru Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC), a domain-aware knowledge modeling framework using C-D-C triples to enable context-sensitive reasoning, implemented in Prolog, with case studies showing benefits over fixed ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge graphs are limited by fixed ontologies and treating domains as implicit context. There is a need for explicit, reasoning-level domain components to support context-aware, cross-domain reasoning and personalization.

Method: Propose CDC; define C-D-C triple <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'>; domains as dynamic classification dimensions; grounding in cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping; formalize >20 relation predicates across structural, logical, cross-domain, temporal; implement in Prolog for full inference.

Result: CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling; case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation; capabilities exceed traditional ontology-based frameworks.

Conclusion: CDC offers a novel framework elevating domains to first-class conceptual elements, enabling flexible, domain-aware reasoning and personalized knowledge representation.

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

TL;DR: Introduces DeepAnalyze-8B, an 8B-parameter agentic LLM for fully autonomous data science, enabling end-to-end pipelines from raw data to analyst-grade deep research reports through curriculum-based training and a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework, and showing improvements over prior workflow-based agents; code and data are open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous data science—from raw data sources to analyst-grade insights—remains challenging due to reliance on predefined workflows. Current workflow-based agents struggle with fully autonomous, open-ended data tasks, especially complex analyses that require integrating multiple capabilities in real-world settings.

Method: Proposes a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that mimics human data-science learning, enabling progressive acquisition and integration of multiple capabilities. Introduces a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework to construct high-quality training data. Implements DeepAnalyze-8B to perform end-to-end data tasks across data question answering, specialized analytical tasks, and open-ended data research.

Result: Experiments show that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on the most advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: This work paves the way toward autonomous data science, and by open-sourcing the model, training data, and code, it accelerates adoption and future research in the field.

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Enforce and reward visual state reasoning in VLM agents via a POMDP-based RL framework, decomposing reasoning into state estimation and transition modeling; show task-dependent internal representations and dense supervision (World Modeling Reward, Bi-Level GAE) leading to strong multi-task performance in the VAGEN framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from textual to visual observations in Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. The paper investigates whether explicit visual state reasoning can enable VLM agents to build internal world models.

Method: Architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning using reinforcement learning under a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Decompose reasoning into State Estimation (what is the current state?) and Transition Modeling (what comes next?). Introduce five reasoning strategies, a World Modeling Reward for dense, turn-level supervision of state prediction, and Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Evaluate within the VAGEN framework and compare against large proprietary agents; report a 3B-parameter model achieving strong multi-task performance.

Result: A 3B-parameter VLM agent achieves 0.82 score across five diverse benchmarks, about 3× higher than its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67), and Claude 4.5 (0.62). The framework enables scalable training and analysis of multi-turn VLM agents in diverse environments.

Conclusion: Explicit visual state reasoning with a POMDP-based framework and dense World Modeling rewards yields robust internal world models. Task demands shape internal representations (natural language best for semantic relations; structured formats best for precise manipulation). The World Modeling Reward and Bi-Level GAE provide effective supervision and credit assignment, and the VAGEN framework supports scalable development and evaluation; code and data are publicly released.

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New human-grounded evaluation for XRL explanations: can users identify an agent's goal from explanations? In Ms. Pac-Man with four XRL algorithms, only one beat random; users show overconfidence; self-reported ease/understanding do not predict accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of comparative, human-centered evaluations of XRL explanations and whether explanations enable users to infer the agent's goal.

Method: Human subjects assess explanations of agent decisions in Atari Ms. Pac-Man across four XRL algorithms; measure accuracy relative to random; collect self-reported ease of identification and understanding; analyze correlation between perceived ease/understanding and accuracy.

Result: Only one algorithm achieved accuracy above random; overall accuracy near or below random; users were generally overconfident; no correlation between self-reported ease/understanding and accuracy.

Conclusion: Current XRL explanations may be ineffective for conveying agent goals; evaluation approaches should incorporate human-grounded assessments; overconfidence is a risk; future work should improve explainer design and evaluation."

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

TL;DR: LLM-based agentic framework with multi-agent collaboration for GPU kernel optimization, achieving up to 16x speedups on KernelBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing GPU kernels is hard due to complex interactions among memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and hardware specifics; current LLM approaches are limited as single-shot generators or naive refinements.

Method: An agentic LLM framework that uses multiple collaborating agents, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search to explore kernel design space, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively, mimicking expert engineers.

Result: Compared to baseline agents, the approach yields substantial improvements, solving cases where baselines fail and achieving kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance on KernelBench.

Conclusion: Agentic LLM frameworks show strong potential for fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolCritic is a diagnostic framework that identifies eight tool-calling errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogue, provides targeted feedback to the LLM, and improves tool-calling accuracy (up to 13%) on SGD by training on a synthetic dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability issues in tool usage by LLMs; miscalls and misinterpretations degrade performance in real-world tool-augmented dialogue; need automatic diagnostics and feedback loops.

Method: Define eight tool-calling error types; build ToolCritic to diagnose errors and generate feedback; main LLM uses feedback to revise response; train ToolCritic on synthetic data; evaluate on SGD; compare to baselines like zero-shot prompting and self-correction.

Result: ToolCritic improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines; demonstrates more robust tool integration.

Conclusion: ToolCritic is a promising step toward robust, tool-augmented LLMs; potential for broader tool sets and deployment in real-world dialogues; future work could expand error taxonomy, test across domains, and integrate with live tool systems.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent BRAINCELL-AID system blends free-text descriptions with ontology labels and PubMed-informed retrieval to improve gene-set annotation for scRNA-seq; achieved 77% correct top annotations and large-scale brain cell atlas annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating transcriptional signatures from scRNA-seq is difficult when genes are poorly characterized. Traditional GSEA relies on curated annotations and underperforms here; LLMs struggle with structured ontologies. A system that fuses free-text, ontologies, and literature can improve accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Develop BRAINCELL-AID, a multi-agent AI workflow using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to integrate free-text descriptions with ontology labels and relevant PubMed literature, refining predictions and reducing hallucinations. Applied to mouse brain cell atlas from BICCN.

Result: Achieves correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among top predictions; annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters; reveals region-specific gene co-expression patterns and infers functional roles; identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions.

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID provides a valuable resource for community-driven cell type annotation, improving robustness and interpretability of annotations and extending coverage to poorly characterized gene sets.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two LLM-based systems (NAS and KPD-MADS) generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence for corporate credit assessment; KPD-MADS shows higher quality and usability with significant productivity gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-financial indicators influence loan outcomes but are hard to formalize; need interpretive, explainable AI for professional loan evaluation; improve automation with structured reasoning.

Method: Develop NAS (non-adversarial single-agent, single-pass) and KPD-MADS (ten-step Popper-based debate multi-agent); apply to three real corporate cases; evaluate by experienced credit risk professionals; compare with manual reports; measure productivity and quality.

Result: Productivity gains: NAS 11.55s per case; KPD-MADS 91.97s; human baseline 1920s. KPD-MADS higher ratings: explanatory adequacy 4.0 vs 3.0; practical applicability 4.0 vs 3.0; usability 62.5 vs 52.5.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent interaction enhances reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI; supports scalable, defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

Motivation: Objective, interpretable, and standardizable freshness assessment to replace subjective sensory checks and handle species-dependent spoilage cues.

Method: Extract complementary features: color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces; texture features (LBP, GLCM) from global images and ROI; incremental fusion of features; train LightGBM on full-image features and ANN on augmented data; evaluate on FFE dataset.

Result: LightGBM: 77.56% accuracy (14.35% above previous DL baseline 63.21%); with augmented data, ANN: 97.16% accuracy (19.86% above prior best 77.3%).

Conclusion: Handcrafted features, when carefully engineered and fused, provide robust, interpretable, and effective automatic fish freshness assessment suitable for real-world quality monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

### [234] [Physics-Informed Large Language Models for HVAC Anomaly Detection with Autonomous Rule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17146)
*Subin Lin,Chuanbo Hua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PILLM is a physics-informed LLM framework that uses an evolutionary loop to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly-detection rules for HVAC faults, achieving state-of-the-art performance with interpretable, physically grounded rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC systems dominate building energy use; reliable anomaly detection is needed. Classic rule-based methods are explainable but inflexible; deep learning offers power but lacks transparency and physical plausibility; LLMs help with interpretability but often ignore physics.

Method: PILLM embeds physics-informed reflection and crossover operators in an evolutionary loop where an LLM generates candidate anomaly-detection rules, which are evaluated and refined against thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints.

Result: On the public Building Fault Detection dataset, PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance and produces diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable.

Conclusion: The framework advances trustworthy and deployable AI for smart buildings by combining adaptive rule learning with physical grounding.

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

### [235] [Which LLM Multi-Agent Protocol to Choose?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17149)
*Hongyi Du,Jiaqi Su,Jisen Li,Lijie Ding,Yingxuan Yang,Peixuan Han,Xiangru Tang,Kunlun Zhu,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProtocolBench, a benchmark to compare agent communication protocols across four axes (task success, latency, overhead, robustness), demonstrating substantial performance variation across protocols. It also presents ProtocolRouter, a learnable router that selects per-scenario/module protocols to improve recovery and success, and releases ProtocolRouterBench for standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large-scale multi-agent systems, the choice of communication protocol critically shapes performance and reliability, yet lacks standardized evaluation and guidance. Existing protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora, etc.) are often chosen heuristically.

Method: Define ProtocolBench with four measurable axes to systematically compare protocols. Evaluate multiple protocols on scenarios (Streaming Queue, Fail-Storm Recovery). Develop ProtocolRouter, a learning-based router that selects protocols per scenario/module from requirements and runtime signals. Release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize evaluation.

Result: ProtocolBench reveals meaningful performance gaps: up to 36.5% variation in completion time and 3.48 s in mean latency across protocols; Fail-Storm Recovery shows differing resilience. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline and achieves scenario-specific gains (e.g., GAIA). ProtocolRouterBench is released to standardize protocol evaluation and improve scalability reliability.

Conclusion: Systematic protocol benchmarking and a learnable per-scenario router can significantly improve performance and reliability in multi-agent systems; the authors provide standardized tooling for evaluation and a practical routing solution.

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

### [236] [Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172)
*Shun Huang,Wenlu Xing,Shijia Geng,Hailong Wang,Guangkun Nie,Gongzheng Tang,Chenyang He,Shenda Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid ECG-based predictor combining a foundation model with XGBoost achieves superior accuracy and interpretability for VT/VF risk after AMI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional risk scores have limited predictive performance and end-to-end deep learning models often lack interpretability; there is a need for accurate and explainable risk tools for malignant VT/VF after AMI.

Method: Analyze 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients (175 with VT/VF). Use a large-scale ECG foundation model (ECGFounder) to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features, apply feature selection, and train an XGBoost classifier. Evaluate using AUC and F1-score. Interpret with SHAP. Compare against KNN, RNN, and end-to-end 1D-CNN baselines.

Result: Hybrid model ECGFounder + XGBoost achieved AUC 0.801, outperforming KNN (0.677), RNN (0.676), and 1D-CNN (0.720). SHAP identified key features like premature ventricular complexes (risk) and normal sinus rhythm (protective) consistent with clinical knowledge.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that outputs from a foundation model can serve as effective automated feature engineering for an explainable AI-based clinical decision support system, improving VT/VF risk prediction after AMI while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

### [237] [Offline Policy Evaluation of Multi-Turn LLM Health Coaching with Real Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17173)
*Melik Ozolcer,Sang Won Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heavy-tool policy increases average logged value but harms subgroups (e.g., low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy) in a web-based tool-augmented LLM health coach; a small early information-gain bonus in a simulator shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3; authors advocate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, train subgroup-aware decision heads with typed rewards, and report per-archetype metrics to reveal subgroup harms obscured by averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how tool augmentation and policy design affect real-user health coaching outcomes, including fairness across subgroups, and to explore methods for safe, personalized deployment of LLM-based health coaches.

Method: Offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) with a uniform heavy-tool policy; real-user pilot (7 users, 280 rated turns); a lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes and an early information-gain bonus to study trait identification speed and outcome metrics (goal success, pass@3).

Result: A uniform heavy-tool policy raises average logged-value metrics but harms subgroups, notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. The early information-gain bonus in the simulator reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3.

Conclusion: An evaluation-first path to personalization is viable: freeze the generator, develop subgroup-aware decision heads trained on typed rewards (tool outcomes and satisfaction), and report per-archetype metrics to surface harms hidden by averages; this helps balance effectiveness with fairness and aids targeted improvements.

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

### [238] [Graph Attention-Guided Search for Dense Multi-Agent Pathfinding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17382)
*Rishabh Jain,Keisuke Okumura,Michael Amir,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid learning-guided search (LaGAT) for dense multi-agent pathfinding improves performance by integrating an enhanced MAGAT heuristic into LaCAM, with pretrain-finetune and deadlock detection, outperforming pure search or pure learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense MAPF is still hard to solve in real-time due to tight coupling among agents. Prior learning-guided search methods underperform; a hybrid approach that combines neural heuristics with robust search and deadlock handling is sought to achieve near-optimal, real-time solutions.

Method: Enhance MAGAT architecture, pre-train on maps of interest, then fine-tune; integrate learned heuristic into LaCAM (a search-based MAPF solver); employ a graph-attention scheme; include a deadlock detection mechanism to counter imperfect guidance.

Result: LaGAT outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based approaches in dense MAPF scenarios, demonstrating that carefully designed hybrid search can effectively solve tightly coupled multi-agent coordination problems.

Conclusion: A carefully designed hybrid search framework that leverages learned heuristics with deadlock-aware search can deliver near-optimal real-time solutions for dense, tightly coupled MAPF problems.

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

### [239] [Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural ODEs for Type 2 Diabetes Progression Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17211)
*Tingsong Xiao,Yao An Lee,Zelin Xu,Yupu Zhang,Zibo Liu,Yu Huang,Jiang Bian,Serena Jingchuan Guo,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neural ODE-based temporally detailed hypergraph model (TD-HNODE) for disease progression that captures intra- and inter-trajectory marker dependencies on irregular, real-world EHRs, outperforming baselines on two diabetes/CVD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling disease progression requires handling irregular sampling, continuous-time dynamics, and patient heterogeneity; existing mechanistic and data-driven methods struggle to adapt to real-world data and capture complex dynamics.

Method: TD-HNODE represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. It introduces a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that encodes interdependencies among disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories.

Result: Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion: TD-HNODE offers a flexible and accurate framework for modeling disease progression in heterogeneous populations and may improve sub-phenotyping and timely interventions; applicability to other diseases could be explored.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

TL;DR: Coinvisor is a reinforcement-learning powered multi-agent chatbot for crypto investment that integrates real-time data sources and multi-step reasoning; it outperforms base models in tool orchestration and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investors face high volatility and fragmented information; existing approaches are manual, limited, or static LLMs lacking real-time integration. There is a need for adaptive, integrated analytical assistants in crypto investing.

Method: Develop a reinforcement learning-based multi-agent framework Coinvisor with specialized tools; RL-based tool selection enabling multi-step planning and real-time data integration; evaluation via automated benchmarks of tool calling accuracy and a user study with 20 investors.

Result: Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 by 26.6% over a base model in tool orchestration; user satisfaction 4.64/5, preferring Coinvisor over general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).

Conclusion: RL-driven tool selection enables dynamic, accurate crypto investment analytics with real-time data integration and user-friendly interface; supports scalable, adaptable analysis across diverse data sources.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and
user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show
that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

### [242] [Diverse Planning with Simulators via Linear Temporal Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17418)
*Mustafa F. Abdelwahed,Alice Toniolo,Joan Espasa,Ian P. Gent*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces FBI_LTL, a semantically diverse planner for simulation-based planning that uses Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define and enforce diversity, producing meaningfully different plans rather than syntactically varied ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-plan generators can miss user preferences and fail to capture meaningful qualitative differences between plans. Existing diversity approaches often yield superficially different (syntactically) plans that are semantically similar, especially in simulation-based, non-symbolic domains.

Method: Incorporates LTL-based semantic diversity models directly into the search process of a simulation-based planner. Defines diversity criteria via LTL formulas and guides plan generation to produce a set of plans that are semantically distinct. Evaluates the approach on benchmarks against a baseline to quantify diversity gains.

Result: FBI_LTL yields more semantically diverse plans than the baseline across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments.

Conclusion: Semantic diversity via LTL-guided planning is a feasible and valuable direction for simulation-based planning, enabling richer plan portfolios and better alignment with user preferences in realistic, non-symbolic domains.

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

*Johan Schubert,Farzad Kamrani,Tove Gustavi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-inference route planning for autonomous agents using a Dempster–Shafer evidence map and Gaussian sensors; it computes variational free energy across positions to guide exploration–exploitation by moving toward minimum free energy in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain a shared operational picture by reconnoitering a geographical area while robustly fusing uncertain sensor observations (positive and negative) over time.

Method: Construct an evidence map with Dempster–Shafer theory and Gaussian sensor model; use a Bayesian generative process to update posteriors; compute variational free energy between the pignistic evidence distribution and the posterior target distribution, including surprise from new observations; iterative movement toward positions that minimize free energy in simulation.

Result: Proposes a simulation-based agent movement rule that balances exploration and target tracking by minimizing free energy; demonstrates how evidence diffusion and Bayesian updates drive navigation.

Conclusion: Active inference with a Dempster–Shafer evidence map provides a principled route-planning framework to manage uncertainty and balance exploration and exploitation in autonomous reconnaissance tasks.

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

### [244] [Label Indeterminacy in AI & Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17463)
*Cor Steging,Tadeusz Zbiegień*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Label indeterminacy in legal ML: interventions shape outcomes; training label construction can bias models; need methods that handle indeterminate outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal outcomes are often influenced by interventions (settlements, appeals) not captured in labels, leading to uncertain ground truth and biased models.

Method: Critical analysis of label construction in ECHR case classification; evaluation of existing imputation approaches and demonstration of impact on model behavior.

Result: Different label construction during training significantly changes model behavior; imputation methods rely on unverifiable assumptions.

Conclusion: Acknowledging and addressing label indeterminacy is essential in AI & Law; future work should develop robust methods for indeterminate labels and caution against treating past outcomes as definitive ground truth.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

### [245] [MIRAGE: Agentic Framework for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Web-Grounded Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17590)
*Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil,Sharad Duwal,Abhishek Tyagi,Adiba Mahbub Proma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE is an inference-time, modular agentic framework that uses vision-language reasoning, cross-modal checks, and web-grounded factual checking to detect multimodal misinformation without domain-specific training, achieving strong F1/accuracy on MMFakeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads via billions of multimodal posts and manual fact-checking cannot scale; supervised detectors require domain-specific data and often fail to generalize to new manipulation tactics. There is a need for an inference-time, model-pluggable solution that generalizes across modalities without labeled data.

Method: MIRAGE decomposes verification into four sequential modules: (1) visual veracity assessment to detect AI-generated images; (2) cross-modal consistency analysis to identify out-of-context repurposing; (3) retrieval-augmented factual checking that grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation; (4) a calibrated judgment module that integrates all signals. It orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval and outputs structured, citation-linked rationales.

Result: On MMFakeBench (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent) by 7.65 points (F1). False-positive rate is 34.3% vs 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set (5,000 samples) results: 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation: visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points; retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. 

Conclusion: Decomposed, agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling cross-modal misinformation detection where labeled data are scarce.

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97

Motivation: Code generation requires solution-level understanding and structural reasoning beyond token prediction. Large models are powerful but expensive; the work aims to enable faster, cheaper deployment without sacrificing performance.

Method: Fine-tune a smaller model to emulate the VLLM's reasoning by identifying correct solution pathways and establishing structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions via a novel structure-aware loss optimization, focusing on solution structure rather than token-level predictions.

Result: The fine-tuned model significantly outperforms the baseline on pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match across MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structure-aware distillation enables compact models to capture the solution-building structure necessary for effective code generation, offering efficient deployment with competitive performance.

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

### [247] [OG-Rank: Learning to Rank Fast and Slow with Uncertainty and Reward-Trend Guided Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17614)
*Praphul Singh,Corey Barrett,Sumana Srivasta,Irfan Bulu,Sri Gadde,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OG-Rank is a low-latency, single-decoder reranker that scores all candidates in one pass and emits explanations only when uncertain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for fast, justification-capable ranking in clinical decision tasks.

Method: Single-decoder architecture with a pooled first-token scoring signal and an uncertainty-gated explanation step; one-pass scoring; brief structured rationale produced only when gate activates; curriculum training focuses on hard cases.

Result: Strong encounter-scoped performance (Recall@1 ~0.45, nDCG@20 ~0.625 on fast path); gating improves to Recall@1 ~0.56, nDCG@20 ~0.699 at 45% gate rate; compact backbones show similar gains; encoder baselines lag.

Conclusion: Practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when helpful; single-policy design simplifies deployment; curriculum learning transfers beyond clinical order selection.

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

*Qingchuan Yang,Simon Mahns,Sida Li,Anri Gu,Jibang Wu,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promising forecasting ability as 'Prophets' but face bottlenecks; Prophet Arena enables scalable evaluation of predictive intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large language models trained on Internet-scale data can function as predictive engines for real-world future events and to systematically evaluate their predictive intelligence.

Method: Develop Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into pipeline stages to enable controlled, large-scale experiments across multiple LLMs.

Result: LLMs exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities (low calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence, potential market-return signals); bottlenecks include inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding data sources, and slower information aggregation near resolution.

Conclusion: LLMs have latent predictive potential but require improvements in event recall, data-source integration, and rapid information aggregation; the benchmark enables targeted studies to address these bottlenecks.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

### [249] [A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17697)
*Anjie Liu,Jianhong Wang,Samuel Kaski,Jun Wang,Mengyue Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces targeted intervention in MARL using MAIDs to steer learning through single-agent interventions via PSI, with relevance-graph analysis to assess feasibility; demonstrates effectiveness and analytical validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of global human guidance in large-scale MARL and the lack of accessible, interpretable research tools; provide a principled, scalable framework.

Method: Adopt multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a causal graphical framework, define interaction paradigms, and introduce a targeted intervention paradigm that intervenes on one agent. Implement a Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI) to realize this intervention. Leverage MAIDs’ bundled relevance-graph analysis to assess whether an MARL paradigm is workable under the design. Validate with experiments showing effectiveness of targeted intervention and support from relevance-graph analysis.

Result: The targeted intervention improves alignment with desired outcomes and the PSI mechanism effectively realizes composite goals; relevance-graph analysis confirms the proposed design’s feasibility and usefulness.

Conclusion: MAIDs-based targeted intervention offers a scalable, interpretable tool to steer MARL when global guidance is impractical, enabling principled design and analysis via causal reasoning; supports future work on broader applicability and tooling.

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

*Dayan Pan,Zhaoyang Fu,Jingyuan Wang,Xiao Han,Yue Zhu,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM) and HyCAM to dynamically modulate self-attention for robust, efficient multi-task learning in LLMs, achieving ~3.65% average gains on QA, code, and reasoning tasks with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generalize well but struggle with multi-task adaptation, suffering from catastrophic forgetting and high resource demands with full fine-tuning; existing parameter-efficient methods underperform in complex multi-task settings. A method is needed to preserve general knowledge while enabling task-specific adaptation.

Method: Introduce CAM to dynamically modulate self-attention representations. Integrate CAM into HyCAM, pairing a shared full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized lightweight CAM modules, and apply dynamic routing to fuse knowledge from shared and task-specific components for effective multi-task adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments across heterogeneous tasks (question answering, code generation, logical reasoning) show significant performance gains, with an average improvement of 3.65% over baselines. Code and data are released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: CAM/HyCAM offer an effective and efficient solution for multi-task adaptation in LLMs by balancing retention of general knowledge with task-specific specialization, outperforming existing approaches and enabling reproducible research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

*Zhining Liu,Ziyi Chen,Hui Liu,Chen Luo,Xianfeng Tang,Suhang Wang,Joy Zeng,Zhenwei Dai,Zhan Shi,Tianxin Wei,Benoit Dumoulin,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs often see evidence but don't believe it; a zero-training, inference-time masking method highlighting deep-layer evidence improves accuracy across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why vision-language models fail despite correct visual cues: do they not perceive the evidence or not leverage it effectively? The study investigates layer-wise attention dynamics and a failure mode termed 'seeing but not believing' to diagnose and improve reliability.

Method: Analyze layer-wise attention: shallow layers focus on text; deeper layers attend to localized visual evidence. Identify 'seeing but not believing' where evidence is perceived yet incorrect outputs occur. Propose an inference-time selective attention-based masking to highlight deep-layer evidence regions without retraining, evaluated across multiple model families (LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, InternVL).

Result: Selective masking consistently improves accuracy across several VLM families, revealing that models encode reliable evidence that is under-utilized. The intervention makes evidence signals explicit, bridging perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: VLMs internally encode reliable visual evidence but under-utilize it; explicit highlighting of deep-layer evidence at inference time enhances reliability and provides diagnostics for perception-reasoning gaps.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.

*Jialin Lu,Kye Emond,Kaiyu Yang,Swarat Chaudhuri,Weiran Sun,Wuyang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lean Finder is a user-centered semantic search engine for Lean/mathlib that improves retrieval by over 30% and integrates with LLM-based theorem provers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face difficulty locating relevant theorems and the Lean 4 learning curve; existing engines rely on informal translations and often miss user intent.

Method: Analyze and cluster the semantics of public Lean discussions; fine-tune text embeddings on synthesized user-intent queries; incorporate diverse feedback signals; align with mathematicians' goals from multiple perspectives; ensure compatibility with LLM-based theorem provers to bridge retrieval and formal reasoning.

Result: Evaluations on real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states show Lean Finder achieves over 30% relative improvement compared to previous search engines and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Lean Finder advances retrieval aligned with mathematicians' goals, enabling better support for formal reasoning and bridging to theorem provers; the tool is available at leanfinder.github.io.

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean

### [253] [Lyapunov-Stable Adaptive Control for Multimodal Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15944)
*Tianyu Bell Pan,Mengdi Zhu,Alexa Jordyn Cole,Ronald Wilson,Damon L. Woodard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LS-OGD introduces an online adaptive controller for multimodal learning under concept drift, achieving bounded error and zero error when drift stops; adaptive fusion improves resilience against modality-specific drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal systems suffer from non-stationary data due to concept drift, including modality-specific drifts, requiring continuous, stable adaptation with fault tolerance.

Method: An online controller adjusts the model's learning rate and the fusion weights between modalities based on detected drift and prediction errors; provides theoretical guarantees showing uniformly ultimately bounded error and convergence to zero if drift ceases; uses adaptive fusion to isolate severe modality drift.

Result: Under bounded drift, the LS-OGD predictor has uniformly ultimately bounded error; if drift ceases, error converges to zero; adaptive fusion isolates modality-specific drift, enhancing resilience and fault tolerance.

Conclusion: LS-OGD provides a principled framework for reliable, continuously adapting multimodal learning with theoretical stability guarantees and improved fault tolerance in the presence of concept drift.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

*Guangya Wan,Zixin Stephen Xu,Sasa Zorc,Manel Baucells,Mengxuan Hu,Hao Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEACON is a Bayesian adaptive framework for stopping when to stop sampling multiple LLM responses, reducing samples by up to 80% while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling many responses improves output quality but incurs high computation; there is a need for a principled, cost-aware stopping rule that works online without retraining.

Method: BEACON sequentially samples from a policy LLM, updates a real-time posterior over reward distributions using Bayesian learning, and decides when to stop by weighing the expected utility of further samples against their computational cost, grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning and proven optimality guarantees.

Result: Empirically, BEACON reduces average sampling by up to 80% while maintaining response quality; it is useful for cost-efficient preference data generation and has practical extensions.

Conclusion: BEACON offers a rigorous, tractable solution for adaptive sampling with strong theoretical guarantees and clear practical benefits, suggesting promising directions for future cost-efficient data and decision-making in LLM workflows.

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatMD introduces a knowledge-base of misjudgment risk patterns to guide multimodal LLMs in harmful meme detection, outperforming baselines on a 6,626-meme benchmark (8.30% F1, 7.71% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memes often convey harmful content through implicit cues like irony and metaphor. Existing detection methods, including multimodal LLMs, struggle with these subtleties, leading to false negatives and positives; there is a need to go beyond superficial content-level matching.

Method: Builds a knowledge base that decomposes each meme into misjudgment risk patterns explaining why it might be misjudged. For a target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant patterns and uses them to dynamically guide the LLM's reasoning to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls.

Result: On a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful-detection tasks, PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average 8.30% improvement in F1-score and 7.71% improvement in accuracy, indicating strong generalizability and improved detection of harmful memes.

Conclusion: Proactively identifying and mitigating misjudgment risk via pattern-guided reasoning enhances harmful meme detection and generalizes across tasks.

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

### [256] [WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15947)
*Casper van Laar,Khubaib Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A WaveNet-based model automates EEG classification into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise classes, outperforming CNN/LSTM baselines and a TCN reference. It excels at noise/artifact detection but shows some explainable misclassification between physiological and pathological signals due to clinical overlap. Uses dilated causal convolutions and residual connections to capture short- and long-range temporal patterns, with preprocessing (dynamic partitioning and normalization) to support generalization on a large public dataset of 209,232 samples split 70/20/10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG labeling is labor-intensive and increasingly impractical with growing data; automated, accurate classification is needed. WaveNet's architecture is well-suited to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals, and leveraging publicly annotated datasets can benchmark performance against existing methods.

Method: A WaveNet-based deep learning model trained on a public Mayo Clinic / St. Anne's University Hospital EEG dataset (209,232 samples, split 70/20/10). Includes preprocessing with normalization and dynamic dataset partitioning. Evaluation against CNN and LSTM baselines, and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Uses dilated causal convolutions and residual connections to model fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies.

Result: The WaveNet model achieves accuracy surpassing CNN and LSTM baselines and provides competitive performance relative to TCN. It demonstrates high precision in distinguishing noise and artifacts, with a modest but explainable misclassification rate between physiological and pathological signals due to clinical overlap. Preprocessing steps contribute to model generalization across the large dataset.

Conclusion: WaveNet is well suited for EEG signal classification, particularly for distinguishing noise and artifacts. While physiological vs. pathological distinctions exhibit some overlap, the approach offers robust performance and generalization aided by normalization and dynamic data partitioning, indicating promise for scalable automated EEG labeling.

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

*Arianna Francesconi,Donato Cappetta,Fabio Rebecchi,Paolo Soda,Valerio Guarrasi,Rosa Sicilia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson's disease enabling remote screening and telemonitoring; achieves high external-validation performance using pre-trained hybrid models on multi-dataset data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease affects over 10 million people globally, with prevalence rising; early diagnosis is difficult due to delayed motor symptoms and limits of traditional clinical assessments. A scalable, non-invasive digital biomarker via keystroke dynamics could facilitate remote screening and monitoring.

Method: Preprocess data from four datasets; extract four temporal signals; address class imbalance using three methods. Pre-train eight state-of-the-art architectures on the two largest datasets, tuning temporal windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters. Fine-tune on an intermediate-sized dataset and validate externally on a fourth independent cohort.

Result: Hybrid convolutional-recurrent and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation with AUC-ROC > 90% and F1-Score > 70%. A temporal convolutional model attains 91.14% AUC-ROC in external validation, outperforming methods relying only on internal validation.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics show promise as a reliable digital biomarker for Parkinson's disease, supporting potential for early detection and continuous remote monitoring through telemedicine.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based ensemble score filter (EnSF) is proposed for real-time wildfire data assimilation, claiming superior accuracy, stability, and efficiency for active fire spread predictions, with public code availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate real-time prediction of active wildfire spread is challenging due to high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics and noisy observations. Data assimilation that fuses observations with models is needed, and diffusion-based filtering (EnSF) is a promising approach for such complex problems.

Method: The paper applies Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF), a score-based diffusion-model filtering algorithm, to wildfire data assimilation. It leverages a diffusion model's score to perform filtering in high-dimensional, nonlinear wildfire spread models, with details provided and numerical experiments conducted.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate EnSF achieves superior accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency in wildfire data assimilation compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: EnSF is presented as a robust, practical method for real-time wildfire data assimilation, with public code available to enable adoption and further development.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs often struggle to parse structured JSON outputs from tools; a study with 15 models shows JSON processing is still hard and highly dependent on output size and reasoning needs; prompting strategy quality can lead to large performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-driven automation increasingly relies on tool calls that return JSON, understanding how well LLMs can extract the needed information from structured tool responses is crucial but under-explored.

Method: Created a dataset for tool response processing and evaluated 15 open and closed-weight models using multiple prompting approaches to process and extract information from JSON tool outputs.

Result: JSON processing remains difficult even for frontier models; the optimal processing strategy depends on tool output characteristics (nature and size) and the required reasoning complexity; variations in processing approaches yielded performance differences from 3% to 50%.

Conclusion: Response-processing strategy should be tailored to the tool output; there is no one-size-fits-all prompting approach, and careful design is needed to maximize accuracy across different JSON outputs and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

*Sana Kordoghli,Abdelhakim Settar,Oumayma Belaati,Mohammad Alkhatib*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-enhanced pyrolysis of date seeds and spent coffee grounds (individually and as blends) for hydrogen production; blends show varying kinetic and activation energy; LSTM predicts TGA curves with very high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sustainable energy and waste valorization by exploiting underutilized food-based biomass for hydrogen production; improve process modeling and optimization with AI.

Method: Characterization of pure DS, SCG, and blends (75/25, 50/50, 25/75) using proximate/ultimate/fiber analysis, TGA/DTG, kinetic/thermodynamic studies, Py-Micro GC; isoconversional kinetic analyses (KAS, FWO, Friedman) to assess Ea; LSTM model trained on lignocellulosic data to predict TGA curves.

Result: Blend 3 shows highest hydrogen yield potential but Ea is 313.24 kJ/mol; Blend 1 shows lowest Ea at 161.75 kJ/mol; KAS deemed most accurate among isoconversional methods; LSTM predictions with R^2 0.9996–0.9998.

Conclusion: AI-assisted modelling enhances understanding and optimization of pyrolysis for hydrogen production from DS and SCG blends; selecting optimal blend balances yield and energy requirements; future work to leverage AI to further optimize pyrolysis conditions.

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

### [261] [Interpretable Graph-Language Modeling for Detecting Youth Illicit Drug Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15961)
*Yiyang Li,Zehong Wang,Zhengqing Yuan,Zheyuan Zhang,Keerthiram Murugesan,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAMI is a novel joint graph-language model that detects illicit drug use among TYAs by modeling latent relations among survey variables and generating human-readable explanations; it surpasses baselines in predictive accuracy and reveals interpretable psychosocial risk pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survey analyses typically treat survey variables independently, missing latent, interconnected structures and lacking natural-language interpretability. A method that jointly uncovers latent relationships and provides explanations could improve detection and inform interventions.

Method: Represent each respondent’s survey responses as a relational graph. Use a specialized graph structure learning layer to discover latent connections among features. Integrate a large language model to generate natural-language explanations grounded in both the discovered graph structures and survey semantics. Evaluate on large-scale TYAs datasets (YRBS and NSDUH).

Result: LAMI achieves superior predictive accuracy compared with competitive baselines on YRBS and NSDUH. Interpretability analyses identify meaningful substructures and psychosocial pathways (e.g., family dynamics, peer influence, school-related distress) consistent with established risk factors for substance use.

Conclusion: Joint graph-language modeling is a promising approach for detecting illicit drug use from survey data, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable insights into risk factors that can guide targeted interventions.

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

### [262] [CTR-LoRA: Curvature-Aware and Trust-Region Guided Low-Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15962)
*Zhuxuanzi Wang,Mingqiao Mo,Xi Xiao,Chen Liu,Chenrui Ma,Yunbei Zhang,Xiao Wang,Smita Krishnaswamy,Tianyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA is a curvature-guided PEFT framework that jointly schedules LoRA rank updates with a trust-region constraint, yielding better accuracy and efficiency on 7B-13B models across distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods improve efficiency via low-rank updates, quantization, or budget reallocation, but often decouple capacity allocation from update dynamics, potentially harming stability and efficiency. A principled approach that jointly optimizes rank and updates under curvature-informed guidance is desirable.

Method: Introduce CTR-LoRA: uses marginal utility from lightweight second-order proxies to allocate LoRA ranks; enforces a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust region to constrain updates; integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization; evaluated on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B) with in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Result: Across benchmarks, CTR-LoRA consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines; increases accuracy; improves training stability; reduces memory usage; increases throughput; achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA demonstrates a principled, robust, and deployable path for PEFT, combining curvature-based rank scheduling with trust-region updates to enhance both performance and efficiency; the approach appears generalizable beyond the tested backbones.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

*Tuowei Wang,Kun Li,Zixu Hao,Donglin Bai,Ju Ren,Yaoxue Zhang,Ting Cao,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Shadowy Sparsity and Long Exposure to accelerate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of LLMs, achieving up to 2.49x speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inefficiency of PEFT methods creates high time and operational costs for adapting pre-trained LLMs to diverse downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce Shadowy Sparsity as a distinct fine-tuning sparsity form; design Long Exposure system with three components—Shadowy-sparsity Exposer, Sequence-oriented Predictor, and Dynamic-aware Operator—to efficiently handle sparse, large-sequence, and dynamic computations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to a 2.49× speedup in end-to-end PEFT for LLMs.

Conclusion: Shadowy Sparsity and the Long Exposure system offer a promising approach to accelerating PEFT for LLMs, potentially enabling faster and more cost-effective fine-tuning workflows.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

*Mohan Zhang,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Zhangyang Wang,Sijia Liu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Deadlock Attack to exhaust LRMs by adversarial embeddings causing perpetual reasoning loops; solves continuous-to-discrete projection gap with backdoor strategy; achieves 100% success on four LRMs across math benchmarks; maxes token usage; stealthy and robust against mitigations; reveals risk in reasoning-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal a security vulnerability in large reasoning models where multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can be hijacked to exhaust resources and degrade reliability; current defenses remain underexplored.

Method: Train a malicious adversarial embedding that pushes the model to generate transitional tokens (e.g., Wait, But) after reasoning steps, inducing perpetual reasoning loops. Address the continuous-to-discrete projection gap via a backdoor implantation strategy enabling reliable activation through trigger tokens. Evaluate across Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, and R1-Llama on three math reasoning benchmarks; measure attack success and token usage.

Result: Achieves a 100% attack success rate across all four models and three math benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token limits. The attack is stealthy, causing negligible utility loss on benign inputs, and remains robust against existing mitigation strategies aimed at reducing overthinking.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical security vulnerability in reasoning-enabled LRMs related to reasoning (in)efficiency. Calls for defense research in embedding and prompt-hardening to detect and mitigate backdoored embeddings and to prevent perpetual CoT loops in LRMs.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

### [265] [Gains: Fine-grained Federated Domain Adaptation in Open Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15967)
*Zhengyi Zhong,Wenzheng Jiang,Weidong Bao,Ji Wang,Cheems Wang,Guanbo Wang,Yongheng Deng,Ju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gains is a fine-grained open-set federated domain adaptation framework that splits models into encoder and classifier to detect and integrate new knowledge while preserving source-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In realistic federated learning, new clients continuously join, bringing new knowledge. This requires detecting new knowledge (knowledge discovery) and integrating it (knowledge adaptation) without sacrificing performance on existing domains. Existing methods are coarse-grained and inefficient.

Method: Gains divides the model into an encoder and a classifier. It analyzes that encoder features are sensitive to domain shifts and classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. It then employs fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation to incorporate new knowledge, plus an anti-forgetting mechanism to maintain source-domain performance.

Result: Experiments on multi-domain datasets under three typical data-shift scenarios show Gains significantly outperforms baselines for both source-domain and target-domain clients. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Gains offers a balanced and effective open-set federated domain adaptation by enabling fine-grained discovery and controlled integration of new knowledge while preserving performance on existing domains.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

TL;DR: SAU-FNO: a self-attention U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator for 3D IC thermal prediction that leverages transfer learning to reduce high-fidelity data needs, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with an 842x speedup over FEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D integrated circuits have rising power densities causing serious thermal management challenges. Traditional PDE solvers are accurate but slow for iterative design; vanilla ML approaches like FNO are faster but struggle with high-frequency information and depend heavily on high-fidelity data.

Method: Propose Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator (SAU-FNO) by integrating self-attention and U-Net architectures with FNO to capture long-range dependencies and local high-frequency features. Employ transfer learning to adapt low-fidelity data to high-fidelity representations, reducing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets.

Result: SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art thermal prediction accuracy and delivers an 842x speedup over traditional FEM methods, enabling efficient 3D IC thermal simulations.

Conclusion: SAU-FNO is a fast and accurate tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations and can accelerate design workflows by providing high-fidelity-like predictions with significantly reduced data and computation requirements.

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intro of LinearizeLLM, an agent-based LLM framework that automatically linearizes nonlinear optimization patterns into exact, solver-ready linear models by assigning reformulation agents to patterns and coordinating their assembly; validated on 20 real-world problems derived from ComplexOR across multiple LLMs, showing automation of linearization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is manual, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. Automating the linearization step would make nonlinear optimization more accessible and faster by enabling solver-ready models through conversational modeling.

Method: Assigns each nonlinear pattern to a dedicated reformulation agent instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its pattern (e.g., absolute-value terms, bilinear products). Agents coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model equivalent to the original problem. Evaluation uses a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear problems derived from ComplexOR and tests several LLMs.

Result: Specialized LLM agents can automate linearization tasks, enabling a fully conversational modeling pipeline for nonlinear optimization and demonstrating feasibility across multiple problems and LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of automated, agent-based linearization from NL to solver-ready linear models, suggesting a path toward end-to-end conversational optimization pipelines; further work needed on broader nonlinearities, guarantees, and robustness.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

TL;DR: Persistent homology provides a principled way to quantify data diversity and redundancy in training data, going beyond entropy-based measures to improve AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The effect of data geometry on model performance is underexplored; understanding and reducing redundancy while preserving representation richness may improve learning outcomes.

Method: Apply persistent homology to data in a metric space to extract topological features (e.g., persistence diagrams, Betti numbers) as quantitative proxies for diversity and redundancy; compare with entropy-based metrics.

Result: PH is highlighted as a powerful tool for analyzing and improving training data quality; demonstrates potential to inform data selection/curation.

Conclusion: PH provides a principled, geometry-aware framework for training data assessment, complementing existing methods and guiding data collection to enhance AI training.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

*Wenyun Li,Zheng Zhang,Dongmei Jiang,Xiangyuan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALE uses prompt-based data augmentation and a Contrastive Mahalanobis Score to detect LLM hallucinations without extra labels, achieving a notable performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models and the scarcity of well-labeled data for reliable hallucination detection necessitate data-efficient, scalable approaches.

Method: Generate truthful and hallucinated data via prompt-guided responses from LLMs (data augmentation). Introduce the Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score) to evaluate truthfulness by modeling truthful vs. hallucinated distributions in intermediate activation spaces, using matrix decomposition. No additional human annotations required.

Result: PALE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a significant margin of 6.55% in hallucination detection performance.

Conclusion: PALE is practical, generalizable, and cost-efficient for real-world hallucination detection, reducing reliance on labeled data with strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

TL;DR: AIDA-based data assimilation initialization enables AI weather prediction in an observation-space framework (DAWP), addressing irregular data and improving rollout/efficiency with potential for global precipitation forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reanalysis-based AI weather prediction suffers from data assimilation biases and temporal misalignment. To unlock true observation-space forecasting, AIWPs must handle irregular, high-resolution measurements across diverse sensing systems.

Method: DAWP introduces an AIDA module that uses a mask multi-modality autoencoder (MMAE) to assimilate irregular satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. It also employs a spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning (CBC) to learn dynamics in observation space for sub-image-based global forecasting.

Result: Comprehensive experiments indicate that AIDA initialization significantly improves rollout performance and efficiency of AIWP, and the framework shows promising potential for global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: DAWP enables AI weather prediction directly in observation space and has strong potential for global precipitation forecasting, highlighting the value of observation-space learning and data assimilation integration.

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

*Zexu Sun,Yongcheng Zeng,Erxue Min,Heyang Gao,Bokai Ji,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cog-Rethinker introduces a hierarchical metacognitive RL framework to improve sample efficiency and reasoning performance in zero-RL LLMs by decomposing and refining problems across two stages and applying supervised fine-tuning, achieving better results on mathematical benchmarks with faster convergence compared to fixed-prompt baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-RL suffers from sampling inefficiencies when using fixed prompts; weak LLMs generate many invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtering, wasting samples. There is a need for more efficient rollout strategies and training signals that mimic human metacognition.

Method: A two-stage hierarchical metacognitive RL approach. Stage 1 prompts the policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning. Stage 2 uses zero-accuracy outputs from Stage 1 and refines them by referencing previous wrong solutions. To enable cold-start and consistency, the method applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples from both stages with the direct rollout template.

Result: Experimental results show Cog-Rethinker achieves superior performance on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks and exhibits improved sample efficiency, accelerating convergence compared with baseline zero-RL methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating hierarchical metacognition and targeted fine-tuning improves zero-RL LLM reasoning, providing a practical approach to boost sample efficiency and performance without relying on fixed prompt templates.

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: KD for LLMs faces high-dimensional outputs causing near-zero probabilities, capacity gaps, and training instability; prior assistant-distribution methods are fragmented and fixed; there is a need for a continuous, theoretically grounded interpolation and divergence design.

Method: Introduce alpha-mixture assistant distribution parameterized by alpha, providing a continuous extension of assistant distributions; define AMiD by leveraging this distribution and a generalized family of divergences for the KD loss; perform extensive experiments showing stability and performance gains.

Result: AMiD achieves superior performance and training stability compared to prior KD approaches that rely on fixed assistant distributions or limited divergences.

Conclusion: A broad, theoretically grounded space of assistant distributions via alpha-mixture and divergences improves KD for LLMs, unifying and generalizing prior methods and enabling more stable, effective distillation.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sleep disorders are prevalent and diagnostically complex due to diverse symptom presentations; there is a need for interpretable AI that can aid clinicians by revealing factors driving different disorder profiles.

Method: Unsupervised clustering to group patients into sleep-disorder profiles; integration of an explainable AI approach to highlight influential factors per cluster; evaluation on anonymized real patient data.

Result: The approach is effective and relevant, demonstrating useful insights and potential clinical value on real anonymized data.

Conclusion: A combined clustering + XAI framework can enhance understanding of sleep-disorder heterogeneity and support clinical decision-making, with opportunities for refinement and validation.

Abstract: Sleep disorders have a major impact on patients' health and quality of life,
but their diagnosis remains complex due to the diversity of symptoms. Today,
technological advances, combined with medical data analysis, are opening new
perspectives for a better understanding of these disorders. In particular,
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI model decisions
understandable and interpretable for users. In this study, we propose a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to identify, manipulate, and compose algorithmic primitives in LLMs using activation-geometry; primitives transfer across tasks/models and are strengthened by reasoning finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain how latent/inference-time computations support multi-step reasoning, link traces to activations, and quantify compositionality and generalization of reasoning primitives across tasks and models.

Method: Trace and steer primitives by injecting into residual streams; cluster activations to define primitives and label traces; derive primitive vectors via function-vector methods; compose vectors via addition/subtraction/scalar operations; evaluate cross-task/cross-model on Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B; compare Phi-4 and Phi-4-Reasoning; inject primitives into Phi-4-Base to induce reasoning hallmarks.

Result: Identification of shared and task-specific reasoning primitives; evidence of compositional geometry in activation space; improved systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives after reasoning finetuning; transfer of primitives across tasks/models; injection of primitive vectors reproduces Phi-4-Reasoning behavior.

Conclusion: Reasoning in LLMs may rely on a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives; primitives generalize across domains and can be enhanced via reasoning finetuning, offering a framework to study and manipulate LLM reasoning.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

### [276] [Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15990)
*Kangqi Ni,Zhen Tan,Zijie Liu,Pingzhi Li,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO is a conservative reweighting bound by the base model's distribution; it fails to uncover completely novel solutions and yields OOD gains only when tasks align with pretrained biases; otherwise, benefits on in-distribution tasks saturate and diminish. Overall, GRPO sharpens pretraining biases rather than universal reasoning, highlighting the need for methods that expand beyond pretraining origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when GRPO improves reasoning and generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks in Large Language Models, given reported inconsistent gains across domains.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing GRPO as a conservative reweighting scheme bounded by the base model distribution; controlled experiments by training transformers from scratch and evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality.

Result: GRPO cannot discover completely novel solutions; OOD improvements arise only when the target task aligns with pretrained biases; performance on in-distribution tasks saturates and may even decline as base performance is saturated; GRPO effectively sharpens pretraining biases.

Conclusion: GRPO is not a universal reasoning enhancer. The results motivate developing algorithms that extend model capabilities beyond the pretraining origin and that can support more robust, out-of-distribution reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

*Ziming Dai,Tuo Zhang,Fei Gao,Xingyi Cai,Xiaofei Wang,Cheng Zhang,Wenyu Wang,Chengjie Zang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stratos is an autonomous end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server/model selection, distillation, and deployment to meet user-defined performance and budget constraints, achieving high accuracy with reduced latency/cost in vertical-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where existing distillation frameworks require manual intervention and struggle to satisfy complex, user-specified constraints in latency, budget, and domain-specific tasks.

Method: Stratos automates Pareto-optimal server selection, teacher–student pairing, and adaptive distillation strategies within distributed cloud environments, guided by task complexity and user constraints; it optimizes deployment while ensuring performance targets.

Result: On a rare Mahjong reasoning task using reverse synthetic data and knowledge injection, the student model achieved up to four times the accuracy of the GPT-4o teacher baseline, with reduced latency and cost and without accuracy loss on other measures (implied).

Conclusion: Stratos demonstrates the feasibility and promise of autonomous, constraint-aware distillation pipelines for vertical-domain LLM deployment, enabling tailored, cost-efficient models.

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

### [278] [Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance for Measuring Distribution Shift in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15996)
*Ozan K. Tonguz,Federico Taschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance to monitor distribution shift between training and test data in ML/AI, and links KS magnitude to performance loss. It reports that a KS distance as small as 0.02 can cause a ~50% increase in travel time for a reinforcement learning agent at a single intersection, illustrating practical relevance for real-time drift detection in smart transportation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift between training and real-world test data can severely degrade ML/AI performance and safety. Real-time monitoring of distribution drift and corrective responses are needed, especially in safety-critical or autonomous systems.

Method: Apply KS test to quantify distribution shift (KS distance) and relate it to AI agent performance. Demonstrate that KS distance correlates with degradation in a reinforcement learning agent's travel time in a smart transportation scenario, suggesting KS as a monitoring/diagnostic tool.

Result: KS distance is presented as a valuable statistical tool for monitoring and measuring distribution shift. The abstract highlights a concrete finding: KS = 0.02 can lead to approximately a 50% increase in travel time at a single intersection for a RL agent, indicating practical impact of drift on performance.

Conclusion: KS test and KS distance can help gauge AI/ML performance degradation due to distribution shift and inform strategies to cope with shift in real time, with potential benefits for safety-critical and real-time decision-making domains like smart transportation.

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired SVD-based optimizer with cutoff regularization, improves PINN training; a multi-cutoff adaptation boosts performance; theoretical justification via spectral theory and connections to Green's functions; experiments on benchmark PDEs reach machine precision on some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs often struggle with optimization and generalization. Natural-gradient methods can outperform standard optimizers, but require understanding and regularization. This work analyzes PINN training dynamics under a natural-gradient-inspired method and builds a spectral-theory grounded justification.

Method: Use ANaGRAM, an SVD-based natural-gradient-inspired optimization method with cutoff regularization. Introduce a multi-cutoff adaptation to enhance performance. Develop a spectral-theory framework to justify regularization and connect to Green's functions theory.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark PDEs show improved training dynamics and performance; in some experiments, the method reaches machine precision.

Conclusion: Regularization is necessary per the spectral framework; the theory explains why and connects with Green's functions. The multi-cutoff strategy further enhances performance, validating the proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly
outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs). In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of PINNs optimized
with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value
decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose
a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance.
Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which
allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical
grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the
necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's
functions theory.

### [280] [Layer-Aware Influence for Online Data Valuation Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16007)
*Ziao Yang,Longbo Huang,Hongfu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a layer-aware online influencer estimator for training samples in data-centric learning that runs online during optimization using only loss-to-output gradients, enabling dynamic data valuation with lower time/memory costs across LLM pretraining, fine-tuning, and image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gaps in existing work that estimate sample influence on static, converged models, ignoring how data valuation evolves during optimization in deep models; aims to enable scalable, dynamic data curation.

Method: Introduces a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output gradients (not parameter-level or full-network gradients), designed to preserve the ranking of sample influences while reducing computational overhead.

Result: Empirically improves accuracy with substantially lower time and memory cost across tasks such as LLM pretraining, fine-tuning, and image classification, demonstrating practicality of dynamic data curation.

Conclusion: Dynamic, layer-aware influence estimation enables efficient data-centric learning by providing accurate, scalable data valuation during optimization, facilitating practical dynamic data curation in deep models.

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

### [281] [STAR: Boosting Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection through State-aware Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16014)
*Hanyin Cheng,Ruitong Zhang,Yuning Lu,Peng Chen,Meng Wang,Yang Shu,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR is a plug-and-play module that improves Time Series Foundation Models for multivariate anomaly detection by explicitly modeling discrete state variables through an identity-guided state encoder, a conditional bottleneck adapter, and a numeral-state matching module, leading to better utilization of state information and enhanced detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world industrial TS datasets, many variables are categorical state signals; existing TSFMs treat them as numeric, missing their distinct semantics and sometimes harming performance when integrated with numeric data.

Method: Develop three components: Identity-guided State Encoder with a learnable State Memory to capture categorical semantics; Conditional Bottleneck Adapter that generates low-rank, state-conditioned adaptation parameters; Numeral-State Matching that detects anomalies in state variables. STAR is designed as a plug-in during fine-tuning to augment backbone TSFMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show STAR improves the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Conclusion: STAR effectively leverages state variables to boost anomaly detection in MTSAD and can be readily integrated with existing TSFMs to improve their robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: While Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), however, in
real-world industrial scenarios, many time series comprise not only numerical
variables such as temperature and flow, but also numerous discrete state
variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

*Qian Sun,Graham Hults,Susu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decision-focused, end-to-end framework for strategic in-situ sensor placement and spatio-temporal flood forecasting that minimizes downstream decision regrets under budget constraints, using differentiable modules and I-MLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flood management systems optimize sensing and forecasting with generic metrics, which may not translate into improved downstream decisions. There is a need to align sensing/forecasting with task-specific decision objectives, under budget and data-access constraints.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline with four components: (1) a contextual scoring network, (2) a differentiable sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, (3) a spatio-temporal flood reconstruction/forecasting model, and (4) a differentiable decision layer tailored to task-specific objectives. The framework uses Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations and probabilistic decision heads to approximate constrained disaster-response tasks differentiably.

Result: The paper proposes the framework and differentiable, end-to-end approach; it does not report empirical results in the abstract, but aims to minimize downstream decision regret by aligning sensing/forecasting with task-specific objectives.

Conclusion: This approach provides a principled, differentiable path to optimize disaster response decisions by jointly optimizing sensor deployment and flood forecasts under budget constraints, using I-MLE and probabilistic decision heads to reflect task-specific objectives.

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

*Saeed Salehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Progressive Neural Networks enable robust transfer in DRL-based multifidelity flow control, outperforming conventional fine-tuning which is prone to forgetting and struggles with mismatched source/target settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce training time and data requirements for DRL controllers in chaotic fluid flows by transferring knowledge across fidelity levels, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and improving robustness across differences in physical regimes and objectives.

Method: Apply Progressive Neural Networks (PNNs) for transfer learning in DRL-based flow control. Benchmark against conventional fine-tuning using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system as a testbed. Assess convergence, knowledge retention, and robustness. Include layer-wise sensitivity analysis to understand how representations are reused and adapted across tasks.

Result: PNNs provide stable, efficient transfer with consistent performance gains; they preserve prior knowledge and are robust to overfitting during pretraining. Fine-tuning can accelerate convergence but is highly sensitive to pretraining duration and susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and often fails when source and target differ considerably. Layer-wise analysis shows progressive reuse of representations and deeper adaptation. Overall, PNNs outperform fine-tuning, especially under substantial domain shifts.

Conclusion: PNN-based transfer learning offers a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient approach for DRL-driven flow control across multifidelity settings, with strong potential for application to more complex and diverse flow configurations.

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

*Sangjoon Lee,Haris Moazam Sheikh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AirDbM reduces airfoil design-space dimensionality using 12 morphable baselines to reconstruct 99% of UIUC airfoils with MAE <0.005, enabling fast multi-objective optimization (better Pareto hypervolume) and RL-friendly geometry generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to efficiently explore diverse airfoil designs with minimal design variables, addressing high-dimensional parameterizations that hinder optimization and ML-based design workflows.

Method: AirDbM selects 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC database by sequentially adding baselines that maximize design capacity, then reconstructs other shapes via morphing from these baselines. It evaluates reconstruction accuracy (MAE), performs multi-objective aerodynamic optimization to compare hypervolume with a previous larger-baseline DbM, and tests RL-agent compatibility with the parameterization.

Result: With 12 baselines, 99% of the database is reconstructible with MAE < 0.005, matching a prior DbM using more baselines. In optimization, AirDbM yields faster convergence and a Pareto front with greater hypervolume than the larger-baseline study, finding new Pareto-optimal solutions with improved lift-to-drag at moderate stall. It also shows strong adaptability for RL-driven airfoil generation compared to conventional parameterizations.

Conclusion: AirDbM effectively reduces design-space dimensionality without sacrificing design capacity, delivering faster optimization and better Pareto performance, while offering robust, RL-friendly geometry generation and signaling broader applicability of Design-by-Morphing in ML-assisted design.

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Motivation: PV operators operate under uncertainty; intraday markets offer adjustment opportunities to improve revenues and cut imbalance costs; a data-driven, practical policy-learning approach is needed.

Method: Formulates PV intraday trading as a Markov Decision Process; uses PPO to learn a predominantly linear, interpretable policy; incorporates data-driven features into the state; reward combines trading profit and imbalance penalties; trained on historical data; evaluated out-of-sample; rapid convergence and real-time inference.

Result: Strategy consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios; converges rapidly; supports real-time inference; decision rules are transparent; learned weights emphasize market microstructure and historical features.

Conclusion: Feature-driven reinforcement learning provides a practical, data-efficient, and potentially deployable pathway for active PV intraday participation.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

### [286] [Breaking Memorization Barriers in LLM Code Fine-Tuning via Information Bottleneck for Improved Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16022)
*Changsheng Wang,Xin Chen,Sijia Liu,Ke Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We introduce an information bottleneck–guided fine-tuning (IB-FT) to adapt pretrained LLMs to code; it mitigates a memorization barrier during supervised fine-tuning by compressing memorized spurious features in hidden representations, preserving relevant information. On OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1, IB-FT improves Pass@$1 and yields far more stable gains under Pass@$k^(m) compared with standard FT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning (FT) on code tasks can fail when the base model heavily memorizes downstream code data, trapping optimization and hindering acquisition of generalizable code knowledge. This memorization barrier reduces the effectiveness and stability of FT.

Method: Propose IB-FT, which adds an information bottleneck penalty on hidden representations of code data during fine-tuning. The IB objective compresses spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information, encouraging generalizable representations.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1) shows that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves top-1 Pass@$1, and yields much more stable gains under the stricter Pass@$k^(m) metric compared with conventional FT.

Conclusion: IB-FT is an effective approach to overcoming the memorization barrier in FT for code-generation with LLMs, delivering more robust and generalizable improvements than standard supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

*Fanmeng Wang,Shan Mei,Wentao Guo,Hongshuai Wang,Qi Ou,Zhifeng Gao,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolyConFM is a conformation-centric polymer foundation model pretrained to reconstruct local conformations and orientations, enabling universal modeling and design; it outperforms task-specific baselines across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current polymer DL relies mostly on monomer-level descriptors and lacks a universal foundation model that captures global polymer conformations; data sparsity of conformational data hinders learning. A conformation-centric foundation model could unify modeling and design.

Method: Decompose polymer conformations into sequences of local conformations (repeating units); pretrain via conditional generation with masked autoregressive modeling to reconstruct local conformations, then generate orientation transformations to recover full polymer conformation; build a high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to enable pretraining.

Result: PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and generality.

Conclusion: First polymer foundation model leveraging conformation-centric pretraining and a MD-derived conformation dataset, providing a universal, powerful tool for polymer modeling and design.

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extract interpretable causal signals from imperfect, high-dimensional multimodal clinical data and enable scalable medical discovery at scale.

Method: Process multimodal EHR data, decompose it into probabilistic independent latent sources, train task-specific causal models on these sources, and estimate individual causal effects.

Result: Summary of two real-world applications showing the approach's versatility and utility for medical discovery at scale.

Conclusion: The pipeline is accessible, generalizable, and scalable for identifying latent causal factors in EHRs and quantifying their effects on outcomes, supporting large-scale medical discovery.

Abstract: We provide an accessible description of a peer-reviewed generalizable causal
machine learning pipeline to (i) discover latent causal sources of large-scale
electronic health records observations, and (ii) quantify the source causal
effects on clinical outcomes. We illustrate how imperfect multimodal clinical
data can be processed, decomposed into probabilistic independent latent
sources, and used to train taskspecific causal models from which individual
causal effects can be estimated. We summarize the findings of the two
real-world applications of the approach to date as a demonstration of its
versatility and utility for medical discovery at scale.

*Yingguang Yang,Xianghua Zeng,Qi Wu,Hao Peng,Yutong Xia,Hao Liu,Bin Chong,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoBCtrl is a diffusion+MARL framework that adversarially targets GNN-based social bot detectors, combining diffusion-generated high-fidelity bots and multi-agent RL to optimize bot attachment strategies, demonstrating detector vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study robustness of GNN-based bot detectors against adversarial bot control; address limited agent control, black-box detectors, bot heterogeneity; fill gap in defense research.

Method: Use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing data with minor modifications; employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach to simulate adversarial bot behavior; categorize accounts by influence and budget and assign agents accordingly; optimize attachment strategy via reinforcement learning; implement a hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy to accelerate learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets show the framework can effectively undermine the performance of GNN-based detectors.

Conclusion: Demonstrates vulnerability of current GNN-based bot detectors to adversarial, multi-agent bot control; diffusion-based bot generation and MARL enable realistic, scalable attacks; suggests need for robust defenses and detection hardening; hierarchical state abstraction improves RL efficiency.

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ) is a brain-inspired spatiotemporal quantization method that compresses observation-action sequences into discrete, grid-like codes via an action-conditioned codebook derived from continuous attractor networks, enabling a unified world model for long-horizon prediction and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create compact, joint space-time representations for sequence modeling that enable long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling, inspired by grid-like neural codes and attractor dynamics.

Method: Develop GCQ, a code quantization framework that uses grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. It employs an action-conditioned codebook where codewords come from continuous attractor neural networks and are dynamically selected based on actions, allowing spatiotemporal compression and a unified world model.

Result: Experiments across diverse tasks show GCQ achieves compact encoding and improved downstream performance, supporting long-horizon prediction, planning, and inverse modeling.

Conclusion: GCQ provides a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and offers a theoretical perspective on how grid-like codes may form in neural systems.

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

### [291] [AMS-QUANT: Adaptive Mantissa Sharing for Floating-point Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16045)
*Mengtao Lv,Ruiqi Zhu,Xinyu Wang,Yun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMS-Quant introduces non-integer FP quantization for LLMs with Mantissa-bit Sharing and Adaptive Searching, achieving substantial speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome memory and latency bottlenecks of very large LLMs by extending quantization beyond integer bitwidths to reach an optimal trade-off between accuracy and speed.

Method: Two techniques: Mantissa-bit Sharing groups k weights to share the least significant mantissa bit; Adaptive Searching offline optimizes sharing to minimize accuracy loss; implemented as CUDA kernels.

Result: Quantizes to FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP4.25-e2m2; yields 2.8x and 3.2x decoding speedups over FP16 with negligible accuracy loss on large-scale models/datasets.

Conclusion: Non-integer FP quantization with these techniques effectively accelerates LLM inference while maintaining accuracy, suggesting a practical direction for deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIrilla is a scalable framework that crawls macOS apps using native accessibility APIs to build hierarchical GUI graphs and a large, functionally grounded task dataset (GUIrilla-Task), enabling data-efficient, LLM-guided desktop automation with open-source tooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation datasets are scarce due to annotation costs, closed-source datasets, and surface-level synthetic pipelines; macOS is underrepresented in UI datasets; scalable data collection is needed to train capable agents for desktop autonomy.

Method: Develop GUIrilla crawler that discovers interface elements and actions via macOS accessibility APIs, organize them into hierarchical GUI graphs with specialized interaction handlers, and construct the GUIrilla-Task dataset (27,171 tasks across 1,108 macOS apps) with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility metadata, and semantic action traces; release macapptree for reproducible metadata collection, GUIrilla-Gold benchmark, the dataset, and framework code.

Result: LLM agents fine-tuned on GUIrilla-Task show improved performance on downstream UI tasks, outperform synthetic baselines on ScreenSpot Pro while using 97% less data.

Conclusion: GUIrilla enables scalable, reproducible desktop autonomy research by providing a large, richly annotated macOS-focused dataset and open-source tooling, with components designed for cross-platform applicability.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold
benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

*Chenyang Yu,Xinpeng Xie,Yan Huang,Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-based traffic forecasting has advanced with graph-based models; while event-aware tuning via manual features improves responsiveness to events, it struggles to generalize to unseen events due to reliance on expert-crafted features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for ITS amid growing urban congestion. GNNs effectively capture spatial dependencies in road networks and temporal evolution in traffic data. There is a need to model event-driven perturbations to improve forecast accuracy.

Method: Survey of core GNN-based traffic forecasting models (STGCN, GraphWaveNet) and newer ones (STWave, D2STGNN). Review of approaches to incorporate event information, particularly the use of manually engineered event features or subgraphs to reflect event-induced traffic conditions. Identification of the main limitation: reliance on domain knowledge and potential loss of rich semantic details due to low-dimensional features.

Result: Foundational GNN models achieve impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. Event-aware approaches improve responsiveness to specific events but depend on manually crafted features, which can hinder generalization to diverse unknown events and cause loss of semantic richness.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between event-specific responsiveness and generalization. To handle unknown events robustly, future work should pursue data-driven, semantically rich representations of events that require less hand-crafted engineering.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series foundation models show superior calibration versus baselines and avoid systematic over- or under-confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration is essential for reliable forecasting and decision-making, yet calibration properties of time series foundation models have not been thoroughly explored.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five recent time-series foundation models and two baselines; assess calibration (over-/under-confidence), effects of different prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting.

Result: Time-series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baselines and do not exhibit systematic over- or under-confidence, unlike the overconfidence seen in some other deep learning models.

Conclusion: Foundation models for time series offer improved calibration, enhancing reliability for practical deployment; further work could explore calibration mechanisms and applicability across more tasks.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

TL;DR: A hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) is proposed for substation-level voltage estimation in distribution networks, leveraging electrical topology and physical features, robust to low observability; trained on SMART-DS datasets; shows scalability and strong accuracy with sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address accurate DSSE under sparse measurements and large-scale distribution networks, driven by increasing DER penetration and voltage variability, which challenge traditional DSSE methods.

Method: A hierarchical graph neural network architecture that incorporates electrical topology and physical features for substation-level voltage estimation; trained and evaluated on the SMART-DS dataset across thousands of buses and varying DER penetration; designed to be robust to low observability.

Result: The method achieves up to 2x lower RMSE than competing data-driven models and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1% measurement coverage; validated on thousands of buses across substations and DER scenarios.

Conclusion: GNN-based voltage monitoring in distribution systems is scalable, reproducible, and effective with sparse measurements, enabling real-time monitoring in modern, DER-rich grids.

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

TL;DR: A residual-learning framework augments fast DC-OPF with a topology-aware graph neural network to predict nonlinear corrections for AC-OPF, achieving better accuracy and speed while enforcing feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AC-OPF is computationally expensive for real-time grid operations. A practical approach is to start from a fast DC-OPF solution and learn the missing nonlinear corrections to obtain AC-feasible results.

Method: Topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration that learns residual corrections to the DC baseline. Training uses a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits.

Result: On OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems, the method yields ~25% lower MSE, up to 3× reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13× runtime speedup over conventional AC-OPF solvers, and retains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and large-scale networks.

Conclusion: Residual learning provides a practical, scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decisions.

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

TL;DR: FedPURIN introduces an integer-programming–based parameter selection and sparse aggregation to enable communication-efficient personalized federated learning, achieving substantial communication savings with competitive accuracy under non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity in personalized federated learning leads to performance gaps across clients, while existing approaches often incur high communication costs. There is a need for methods that reduce communication without sacrificing model efficacy, enabling practical deployments on edge devices with heterogeneous data.

Method: Formulate parameter importance as an integer programming problem to identify critical parameters to transmit; incorporate this selection into a sparse aggregation scheme, yielding the FedPURIN framework (Programmed Update and Reduced INformation).

Result: Empirical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions show significant communication reduction while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedPURIN establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, offering practical benefits for edge intelligence systems dealing with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators offer PDE speedups but struggle on irregular, multiscale CFD domains; a scalable architecture that explicitly encodes multiscale inductive biases is needed.

Method: Three-scale architecture: (1) global dimension-shrinkage attention for long-range dependencies; (2) local graph attention for neighborhood interactions; (3) micro point-wise attention for fine-grained details; applied to 3D unstructured point clouds; evaluated on four CFD benchmarks with steady and unsteady flows up to 300k points.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across tasks; reduction in prediction error by 5–40%; improved robustness on challenging 3D CFD problems; demonstrates scalability to 300k points.

Conclusion: Explicit multiscale design is crucial for neural operators; MNO provides a scalable, robust framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

TL;DR: A random-matrix-theory based framework analyzes Transformer training via spectral properties of the shallow self-attention matrix, revealing a three-stage training dynamics and two validation-free early-stopping criteria based on heavy-tailed spectra and convergence signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain principled, validation-free early stopping and a mechanistic understanding of Transformer training dynamics by leveraging Random Matrix Theory to connect spectral properties to optimization progress.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory; analyze the spectral density of the shallow self-attention matrix V; fit its spectrum to a Power-Law distribution as a probing metric; delineate three training stages and derive two criteria for stopping that do not require external validation.

Result: Empirically, the spectral density of the shallow self-attention matrix V evolves toward a heavy-tailed distribution. Using the Power-Law fit as a probe, training is segmented into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed structure stabilization, and convergence saturation, guiding preliminary stopping decisions. Two consistent, validation-free criteria are proposed: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed dynamics and a novel spectral signature of convergence; strong alignment between criteria underscores the utility of RMT for monitoring Transformer training.

Conclusion: Random Matrix Theory provides a practical diagnostic tool for monitoring Transformer training. Heavy-tailed spectral dynamics and a convergence signature enable principled early stopping decisions, and the three-stage framework offers actionable guidance for optimizing training progression.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

### [300] [Optimization of the quantization of dense neural networks from an exact QUBO formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16075)
*Sergio Muñiz Subiñas,Manuel L. González,Jorge Ruiz Gómez,Alejandro Mata Ali,Jorge Martínez Martín,Miguel Franco Hernando,Ángel Miguel García-Vico*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a post-training quantization method for dense networks using an ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation with a Frobenius-error objective. The QUBO is decomposable into independent subproblems, solvable via heuristics (e.g., simulated annealing), and evaluated on standard datasets across int8 to int1, versus round-to-nearest quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve post-training quantization by optimizing rounding choices of weights/biases to minimize the deviation of the pre-activation outputs, addressing quantization error in dense neural networks.

Method: Formulate PTQ as an explicit QUBO using ADAROUND. Binary variables encode rounding decisions for each weight and bias. Objective is the Frobenius distance between the theoretical (quantized) output and the dequantized output before activation. Exploit structure of the coefficient Q matrix to decompose the global QUBO into n independent subproblems of size f+1, solvable efficiently with heuristics such as simulated annealing.

Result: The method is evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1, and compared with round-to-nearest quantization.

Conclusion: A decomposable ADAROUND-based QUBO PTQ framework enables exact-like decomposition into smaller subproblems and flexible heuristic solving, applicable to very low-precision quantization with standard benchmarks, and offering a potential improvement over traditional rounding baselines.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense
neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the
Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

### [301] [BPL: Bias-adaptive Preference Distillation Learning for Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16076)
*SeongKu Kang,Jianxun Lian,Dongha Lee,Wonbin Kweon,Sanghwan Jang,Jaehyun Lee,Jindong Wang,Xing Xie,Hwanjo Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bias-adaptive distillation framework (BPL) for recommender systems that performs well in both factual (real interactions) and counterfactual (exposure-based) tests via dual distillation and reliability filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debiasing methods often optimize for one evaluation setting, either factual or counterfactual, but real systems require good performance in both to reflect user behavior and long-term satisfaction.

Method: Propose Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL) with two distillation strategies: (1) teacher-student distillation from a biased model to preserve feedback-aligned preferences for factual performance; (2) self-distillation with reliability filtering to refine knowledge during training and extend predictions across more user-item pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments show improvements on both factual and counterfactual tests; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: BPL unifies learning for dual evaluation settings by adaptively distilling bias-aware preferences, achieving robust performance across real and simulated exposure scenarios and potentially generalizable to other biased feedback problems.

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

### [302] [Continual Knowledge Consolidation LORA for Domain Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16077)
*Naeem Paeedeh,Mahardhika Pratama,Weiping Ding,Jimmy Cao,Wolfgang Mayer,Ryszard Kowalczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CONEC-LoRA enhances domain incremental learning by fusing shared and task-specific LoRAs, using a stochastic classifier and an auxiliary predictor to select LORAs, plus a depth-adaptive structure with local classifiers and ball-generator loss to reduce bias, achieving >5% gains on 4 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In domain incremental learning, new domains arrive continually, and existing PEFT approaches rely on task-specific LoRAs, which overlook shared knowledge and cause inaccurate LORA selection during inference, leading to degraded generalization. Linear/prototype classifiers also underperform in this setting. There is a need to extract and leverage shared knowledge across tasks while robustly identifying the relevant LORAs for each inference.

Method: Propose CONEC-LoRA, which consolidates task-shared LoRAs to capture common knowledge and task-specific LoRAs for domain-specific knowledge. Introduce a stochastic classifier with parameters sampled from a distribution to improve classification likelihood. An auxiliary network predicts the appropriate task-specific LORAs at inference. Adopt a different-depth network structure where each layer connects to a local classifier to exploit intermediate representations. Incorporate ball-generator loss and a transformation module to mitigate synthetic sample bias. Train end-to-end across domain-incremental streams.

Result: Rigorous experiments on four popular DIL benchmarks show CONEC-LoRA outperforms prior methods, achieving margins greater than 5%.

Conclusion: CONEC-LoRA effectively addresses DIL by integrating shared and task-specific knowledge through consolidated LORAs, probabilistic inference, and an auxiliary predictor, yielding improved accuracy and robustness against forgetting across domain streams.

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

### [303] [PassREfinder-FL: Privacy-Preserving Credential Stuffing Risk Prediction via Graph-Based Federated Learning for Representing Password Reuse between Websites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16083)
*Jaehan Kim,Minkyoo Song,Minjae Seo,Youngjin Jin,Seungwon Shin,Jinwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PassREfinder-FL introduces a federated, graph-based framework to predict cross-site password reuse risk (credential stuffing) using GNN link prediction on a website graph, scalable to many sites, privacy-preserving via FL; achieves high F1 on a large breached-accounts dataset and provides actionable risk scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing credential stuffing defenses often hurt usability by restricting password creation or access and rely on complex, hard-to-deploy account-sharing mechanisms. There is a need for scalable, privacy-preserving risk scoring across many websites to mitigate password reuse risks without compromising usability.

Method: Define password reuse relations as edges in a website graph. Apply graph neural networks for link prediction to estimate cross-site reuse risk. Incorporate public website information and dynamically link new websites as nodes to scale. Extend with federated learning to avoid sharing user data across administrators. Evaluate on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites.

Result: The model achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. An ablation study shows the FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models. Predicted results provide actionable risk scores for password reuse likelihood.

Conclusion: The proposed PassREfinder-FL framework demonstrates scalable, privacy-preserving cross-site credential risk prediction, enabling actionable risk scoring across many websites and offering a practical path toward deploying credential stuffing defenses without harming usability.

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

*Karol Sajnok,Michał Matuszewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is extended to discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems, enabling in-situ training in weakly dissipative physical networks where trainable local potentials replace inter-node connections; demonstrated on exciton-polariton condensates with stable convergence on logic tasks and digit recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of implementing backpropagation in physical neural networks by developing a training algorithm (EP) that works directly in physical substrates and requires only local control, especially in weakly dissipative, complex-valued wave systems where traditional node-based networks are ill-defined.

Method: Extend EP to complex-valued wave dynamics, valid in weakly dissipative regimes, allowing trainable local potentials to substitute trainable inter-node connections. Implement and test on driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics. Evaluate on simple logical tasks and handwritten-digit recognition through numerical simulations.

Result: Demonstrates stable convergence of EP in the described physical setting, establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in systems with local parameter control and limited inter-node connectivity; success on standard benchmarks indicates numerical viability across both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems.

Conclusion: EP can be adapted to complex-valued, weakly dissipative wave networks, enabling training entirely in physical substrates with local tunability and broad applicability across diverse physical implementations, including exciton-polariton condensates.

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

*Ziyang Liu,Pengjunfei Chu,Shuming Dong,Chen Zhang,Mingcheng Li,Jin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSRF presents a factorization-guided framework to recover missing modalities in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) by decomposing features into modality-homogeneous, modality-heterogeneous, and noisy components, and using distribution-aligned self-distillation to recover semantics, achieving strong gains on datasets with incomplete modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world MSA systems often face missing modalities due to occlusion, privacy constraints, or device failures, which hurts generalizability and robustness.

Method: Introduces a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module that factorizes modalities into homogeneous, heterogeneous, and noisy representations with targeted constraints; and a distribution-aligned self-distillation module for bidirectional knowledge transfer to recover missing semantics.

Result: Empirical results on two datasets show significant performance improvements over prior methods when modalities are missing or uncertain.

Conclusion: FSRF effectively mitigates the missing-modality problem in MSA, enhancing robustness and generalization through structured factorization and self-distillation.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

*William Hoy,Nurcin Celik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STABLE gates LoRA-based continual edits to limit forgetting during sequential updates, evaluating edits via EM drop, bits increase, or KL divergence; effective forgetting mitigation with preserved adaptability on Qwen-2.5-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need continual adaptation without full retraining; sequential edits can cause catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.

Method: Apply Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) updates gated by a stability budget; each candidate edit is scored by EM drop, bits increase, or KL divergence; thresholds trigger rescaling via clipping or rejection; experiments on Qwen-2.5-7B compare gating strategies; code released.

Result: Gating reduces forgetting while retaining adaptability; EM-based gating yields highest cumulative performance in short continual sequences; distribution shift (KL) can be similar across gates while accuracy outcomes differ, underscoring the importance of gating design.

Conclusion: A principled continual model-editing framework enabling LLMs to integrate new knowledge while preserving reliability; gating strategy critically shapes outcomes; code available for replication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemCom is a layer-wise prompt compression method for many-shot in-context learning that reduces memory and compute while preserving accuracy, outperforming strong baselines across model sizes, architectures, and compression ratios with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning with many demonstrations incurs high memory and compute costs. Existing prompt compression methods fail to meaningfully reduce these costs for many-shot prompts, and a stronger, layer-wise compression approach is needed to maintain accuracy at large compression ratios.

Method: MemCom introduces layer-wise compression by applying a strong compressor model at each transformer layer to compress many-shot representations. This per-layer, trainable compression enables fine-grained reduction of token representations across layers. The evaluation spans model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot lengths (3k–6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x–8x).

Result: MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. While baselines degrade sharply at high compression (often >20–30%), MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation, typically less than 10%.

Conclusion: Layer-wise compression with a stronger compressor is effective for memory- and compute-efficient many-shot in-context learning, and MemCom generalizes across model sizes and architectures, offering robust performance under substantial prompt compression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

*Eleni Straitouri,Stratis Tsirtsis,Ander Artola Velasco,Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sequential decision-making study where human agency is adaptively narrowed by a pre-trained AI agent, with a bandit algorithm to optimize agency level; validated in a wildfire mitigation game showing substantial human gains over unaided performance and modest gains over the AI agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the complementarity principle from classification to sequential decision tasks by designing a decision-support system that adaptively controls the level of human agency to improve joint performance.

Method: Introduce a system where a pre-trained AI agent narrows the set of permissible actions to a subset, from which the human selects an action. Develop a bandit algorithm that exploits the smoothness of action sets to efficiently optimize the degree of human agency. Evaluate via a large-scale human-subject study (n=1,600) in a wildfire mitigation game; provide data and an open-source implementation.

Result: Humans using the system outperform unaided humans by about 30% and outperform the AI agent by over 2%. The AI agent remains a strong baseline and the system demonstrates meaningful complementarity.

Conclusion: Adaptive control of human agency through narrowing action choices is effective for achieving complementarity in sequential decision tasks, offering a scalable framework evidenced by large-user experiments and open resources for broader application.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

### [309] [An Empirical Study of Lagrangian Methods in Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17564)
*Lindsay Spoor,Álvaro Serra-Gómez,Aske Plaat,Thomas Moerland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automated Lagrangian multiplier updates in safe RL can reach or exceed optimal performance but are highly sensitive and unstable; they produce oscillations that PID control can mitigate, though tuning is essential. Overall, stabilization and general guidance for lambda selection remain open.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the optimality and stability of the Lagrange multiplier (lambda) in safe reinforcement learning, where constraint handling trades off with return; address the limited empirical understanding of automated updates.

Method: Compute and visualize lambda-constraint-returns profiles across multiple tasks to map the trade-off; analyze learning trajectories of automated lambda updates; compare with fixed lambda; evaluate PID-controlled updates to reduce oscillations; provide reproducible code.

Result: Lambda is highly sensitive and there is no universal lambda*; automated updates can recover or exceed fixed-optimal performance due to dynamic adaptation; updates exhibit oscillations during training; PID-controlled updates reduce oscillations but require careful tuning and may not be consistent across tasks; overall stability remains a challenge.

Conclusion: Stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe RL is an open research area; need principled, robust, and easily tunable update rules; while automated updates offer promise, reliable performance requires further stabilization techniques and cross-domain validation.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

TL;DR: A search-based, non-training world model using similarity search and stochastic representations can rival training-based models (PlaNet/Dreamer) and even excel in long-horizon prediction across diverse visuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether a retrieval-based approach can approximate a world model, potentially reducing training requirements and improving robustness in long-horizon dynamics.

Method: Build a world model via similarity search over stochastic latent representations; compare to PlaNet; evaluate latent reconstruction quality and perceptual similarity for next-step and long-horizon dynamics; test across image-based environments.

Result: The search-based model is comparable to training-based models on both short-horizon and long-horizon metrics, and shows stronger long-horizon predictive performance across visually diverse environments.

Conclusion: Retrieval-based (search) world models can match or surpass training-based counterparts in key evaluation metrics, suggesting an alternative paradigm for model-based RL with potential gains in generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First finite-time analysis of on-policy Q-learning with time-varying policies under minimal exploration assumptions; proves last-iterate convergence with O(1/ε^2) sample complexity, matching off-policy yet with worse exploration dependence; provides explicit rate for E[||Q^π_k - Q^*||_∞^2].


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a theoretical gap for RL when sampling is on-policy and policies evolve over time, using minimal assumptions (existence of an irreducible policy) and characterize how on-policy learning converges in finite time.

Method: Leverage Poisson equation to decompose time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise into a martingale-difference term plus residuals; perform sensitivity analysis of the Poisson solution with respect to the Q-function estimate and the learning policy to control residual terms under rapidly varying policies; adapt to slowly/rapidly time-varying learning policies.

Result: Establishes a convergence rate for E[||Q_k - Q^*||_∞^2] and deduces O(1/ε^2) sample complexity for E[||Q_k - Q^*||_∞] ≤ ε; derives an explicit rate for E[||Q^{π_k} - Q^*||_∞^2]; numerical simulations corroborate the theory; shows weaker exploration but exploitation advantage for on-policy Q-learning.

Conclusion: The Poisson-equation-based framework advances the analysis of RL algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies and can extend to other settings, such as single-timescale actor–critic methods and learning-in-games, highlighting a fundamental on-policy/exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

*Dung V. Nguyen,Anh T. Nguyen,Minh H. Nguyen,Luc Q. Nguyen,Shiqi Jiang,Ethan Fetaya,Linh Duy Tran,Gal Chechik,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAMEx introduces Nash Bargaining-based merging for Sparse MoE, with momentum to accelerate expert propagation; achieves superior performance across language, text, and image tasks, including zero-shot robustness, and scales to large MoE systems like Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE merging strategies rely on simple input-dependent/independent averaging and lack a principled weighting mechanism. A game-theoretic perspective reveals cooperative/competitive dynamics among experts and motivates a Nash Bargaining-based framework to achieve balanced, efficient collaboration; additional momentum is proposed to speed convergence.

Method: NAMEx applies Nash Bargaining to guide the merging/aggregation of expert parameters within Sparse MoEs and introduces a complex momentum mechanism to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical convergence guarantees. The approach is designed to integrate seamlessly with popular MoE architectures.

Result: Empirical evaluation across language modeling, text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data corruption shows NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods. It also demonstrates scalability to large-scale systems, including Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), performing well in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

Conclusion: NAMEx provides a principled, scalable, and effective framework for merging experts in SMoEs by leveraging Nash Bargaining and momentum, delivering superior performance across diverse tasks and demonstrating compatibility with existing MoE architectures at large scales.

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

### [313] [Zeroth-Order Sharpness-Aware Learning with Exponential Tilting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16157)
*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a soft SAM objective via exponential tilting (tilt parameter t) to bridge average- and max-loss in zeroth-order optimization; develops gradient-free algorithms, analyzes sharpness, and demonstrates improved generalization over vanilla ZO baselines across NLP and ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic zeroth-order methods optimize averaged losses under perturbations, while sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) targets the worst-case (max) loss in a neighborhood. This work aims to unify these perspectives with a tilting framework that yields a flexible, gradient-free approach with potential generalization benefits.

Method: Define an exponential tilting (soft SAM) objective parameterized by t that smoothly transitions between average and max loss. Develop zeroth-order algorithms to optimize this objective, and provide precise characterizations of sharpness notions within the tilted SAM framework.

Result: The proposed tilted SAM approach offers a gradient-free and memory-efficient alternative to SAM and achieves better generalization than vanilla zeroth-order baselines on tasks including classification, multiple-choice QA, and language generation.

Conclusion: Tilted SAM provides a flexible, gradient-free framework that unifies average and max loss perspectives, enabling memory-efficient optimization with improved generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

### [314] [Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161)
*Ankitkumar Joshi,Milos Hauskrecht*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRUwE is a simple GRU-based model with exponential basis functions designed for irregularly sampled multivariate time series, achieving competitive or superior performance to SOTA with continuous-time predictions and low computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular sampling in multivariate time series poses challenges; many complex architectures exist, but it's unclear if simpler RNN-based modifications can be as effective while offering efficiency.

Method: Introduce GRUwE: a GRU with exponential basis functions that maintains a Markov state updated upon irregular observations. Two reset mechanisms: observation-triggered reset, and time-triggered reset via learnable exponential decays, enabling continuous-time predictions; supports regression and event-based tasks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real-world benchmarks for next-observation and next-event prediction shows GRUwE is competitive to or superior to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: GRUwE’s simplicity yields ease of implementation, minimal hyperparameter tuning, and reduced online deployment overhead, while remaining competitive with or better than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

*Charles Rhys Campbell,Aldo H. Romero,Kamal Choudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Benchmark of three generative models for crystal structure reconstruction on superconductivity datasets; CDVAE best overall; AtomGPT second; FlowMM third; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of standardized, rigorous benchmarking for generative models in materials science; compare performance on real crystal data.

Method: Train AtomGPT (transformer), CDVAE, and FlowMM (Riemannian flow matching) to reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two public datasets (JARVIS Supercon 3D and Alexandria DS A/B); evaluate using KL divergence between predicted and reference lattice-parameter distributions and MAE of lattice constants.

Result: CDVAE achieves lowest KL divergence and MAE, followed by AtomGPT, then FlowMM.

Conclusion: CDVAE appears most accurate for this reconstruction task among the three; results will inform model choice; benchmarking code to be publicly released.

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

### [316] [Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16167)
*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Alignment via RLHF in Llama-3.2-1B is localized to mid-layers: a small, directional, low-rank subspace drives reward-aligned behavior; early/late layers largely unaffected; few layers tie activation changes to reward gains via LASSO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify how human preference tuning (RLHF) shapes LM behavior by identifying where in the network alignment signals reside and whether the process is diffuse or localized.

Method: Layer-wide causal patching between base and tuned models across human preference pairs; analysis on Llama-3.2-1B; use of LASSO regression to link activation-distance changes to reward gains; assesses layer subspaces of alignment.

Result: Alignment is spatially localized to mid-layers; mid-layer activations define a distinct subspace that causally determines reward-consistent behavior; early and late layers largely unchanged; only a small subset of layers have non-zero coefficients linking activations to reward gains.

Conclusion: For some LMs, RLHF-based alignment operates as a directional, low-rank modification rather than a diffuse, high-dimensional one; implications for interpretability and efficient alignment strategies by targeting mid-layer subspaces.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

### [317] [Bridging Symmetry and Robustness: On the Role of Equivariance in Enhancing Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16171)
*Longwei Wang,Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin,KC Santosh,Chaowei Zhang,Xiao Qin,Yang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symmetry-aware CNNs with rotation- and scale-equivariant layers improve adversarial robustness without adversarial training, using parallel and cascaded architectures; theory suggests reduced hypothesis space and tighter CLEVER bounds; empirically stronger robustness and generalization on CIFAR-10/100/10C under FGSM and PGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples reveal deep-network vulnerabilities and current defenses (adversarial training) are computationally expensive and may hurt clean-data accuracy; exploiting symmetry priors via architecture offers a principled, efficient defense.

Method: Introduce rotation- and scale-equivariant group convolutions into CNNs, designing two architectures: a parallel design that fuses standard and equivariant features, and a cascaded design that applies equivariant operations sequentially; provide theoretical analysis showing reduced hypothesis space, gradient regularization, and tighter CLEVER robustness bounds; empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10C under FGSM and PGD without adversarial training.

Result: Models with symmetry-enforcing layers consistently improve adversarial robustness and generalization across the CIFAR datasets under FGSM and PGD without adversarial training.

Conclusion: Symmetry-enforcing architectures offer efficient, principled alternatives to data augmentation-based defenses, yielding robustness gains with potentially lower computational cost.

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

### [318] [The Formalism-Implementation Gap in Reinforcement Learning Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16175)
*Pablo Samuel Castro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL research should move beyond only demonstrating agent performance to a science of learning, and benchmarks should be mapped more precisely to formal RL frameworks; the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), despite saturation concerns, can still be used to develop this understanding and aid real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field’s emphasis on peak performance risks overfitting to benchmarks and neglects analysis of learning dynamics. There is a need for clearer connections between benchmarks and the underlying mathematical formalisms to ensure insights generalize beyond specific tasks.

Method: Conceptual analysis arguing for a shift in focus; uses ALE as a case study to illustrate how a saturated benchmark can still foster understanding when aligned with formalism and used to probe learning dynamics; proposes guidelines for benchmarking that tie tasks to formal RL definitions.

Result: A normative position with practical guidance: RL research should balance demonstrating capabilities with studying learning dynamics, and benchmarks should be designed or interpreted to reflect formal RL constructs; ALE is presented as a productive platform for advancing scientific understanding and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Advocate a rebalanced RL research agenda that foregrounds understanding and rigorous benchmark alignment to formalism, enabling robust science and transferable real-world impact; ALE remains a valuable tool for achieving this when used with explicit connections to RL formalisms.

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends Reward Machines to non-regular, non-Markovian reward specification using RML memory, enabling counting/parametrized conditions and richer, interpretable rewards beyond regular languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL reward mis-specification and lack of explanatory structure; current Reward Machines are typically bounded to regular languages, limiting expressiveness and interpretability of rewards.

Method: Integrate Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) memory into reward machines to form language-based Reward Machines capable of representing non-regular, non-Markovian reward functions; leverage RML constructs for flexible event handling and expressive task specifications; empirical evaluation comparing expressiveness to existing Reward Machine approaches.

Result: Demonstrates increased expressiveness and practical advantages in event handling and task specification over traditional Reward Machine methods; experiments illustrate the ability to capture non-regular, non-Markovian reward structures.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the set of reward functions that can be specified in RL with interpretable automata, enabling more complex and realistic task specifications; future work may address scalability, benchmarking on diverse tasks, and integration with learning algorithms.

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

*Fateme Golivand Darvishvand,Hikaru Shindo,Sahil Sidheekh,Kristian Kersting,Sriraam Natarajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that blends relational reinforcement learning with object-centric representations and active human querying guided by policy uncertainty, effective and efficient for both structured and unstructured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has excelled in perception tasks but struggles with problems that have intrinsic structure. Relational RL (RRL) generalizes poorly due to strong structure assumptions, while many problems are partly unstructured. There is a need to handle varying numbers of objects and exploit object-centric structure; additionally, enabling interaction with humans via uncertainty-driven queries can improve learning efficiency.

Method: Proposes an integrated framework that combines relational RL with object-centric representations and introduces an active querying mechanism to solicit human guidance. The querying is driven by explicit modeling of policy uncertainty.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates the approach’s effectiveness and efficiency, including improved learning performance and better handling of structured/unstructured data, as well as improved generalization to varying object counts.

Conclusion: The framework addresses key limitations of traditional RRL and standard RL by bridging structured and unstructured data handling and enabling uncertainty-guided human guidance, showing promise for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

*Sunmook Choi,Yahya Sattar,Yassir Jedra,Maryam Fazel,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An explore-then-commit strategy for nonstationary bandits with latent state dynamics dependent on actions, achieving tilde O(T^{2/3}) regret; includes system identification, NP-hard optimization insights, and SDP relaxation with Goemans-Williamson rounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model and learn in environments where rewards depend on latent states evolving under actions, with unknown linear dynamics affecting long-term outcomes, and rewards are temporally correlated.

Method: Two-phase algorithm: exploration with random Rademacher actions to estimate the Markov parameters of the action-dependent linear dynamics; commit phase plans an optimized action sequence using the estimates to maximize long-term reward. Theoretical analysis shows equivalence to indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube (NP-hard); provide suboptimality guarantee. Practical computation via semidefinite relaxation followed by Goemans-Williamson rounding.

Result: Regret bound tilde O(T^{2/3}). Near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification with bilinear rewards. Suboptimality guarantee for the induced optimization, enabling the regret bound. SDP relaxation provides a practical algorithm.

Conclusion: The work tackles learning under temporally correlated rewards and action-induced long-term dynamics, delivering both theoretical guarantees and a practical relaxation approach for planning long-horizon actions.

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmark study on label-noise detection methods, decomposing them into label agreement, aggregation, and information gathering; introduces a unified benchmark and a new false negative rate metric; finds in-sample gathering with average probability and logit-margin agreement most effective across vision and tabular data with synthetic and real-world noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise harms training and validation performance, and there is no consensus on the best detection approach. A principled, unified benchmark is needed to compare methods fairly and guide practical deployment.

Method: Decompose detection methods into three components (label agreement function, aggregation method, information gathering approach). Propose a unified benchmark task matching the dataset's noise rate and introduce a new metric (false negative rate at this fixed operating point). Evaluate across vision and tabular datasets under synthetic and real-world noise; compare combinations of components.

Result: The in-sample information gathering with average probability aggregation and the logit margin as the label agreement function achieves the best results in most scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques for specific applications, and the decomposition framework enables systematic, fair comparisons across diverse approaches.

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

TL;DR: ML applied to climate policy progression under the European Green Deal using 165 policies; text representations (TF-IDF, BERT, ClimateBERT) and metadata predict progression status. ClimateBERT excels on text alone; BERT with metadata yields best overall performance. Explainable AI highlights policy wording and metadata (party, country) as influential. Indicates ML can aid climate policy analysis and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge NLP with policy analysis to quantify and predict how climate policies progress from announcement to adoption, supporting policymakers and researchers.

Method: Assemble a dataset of 165 European Green Deal policies with text and metadata. Compare text representations (TF-IDF, BERT, ClimateBERT) for predicting policy progression status. Include metadata features and evaluate using RMSE and R^2. Apply explainable AI methods to identify influential features such as wording and metadata (political party, country).

Result: ClimateBERT outperforms when used on text alone (RMSE=0.17, R^2=0.29). Incorporating metadata with BERT improves performance (RMSE=0.16, R^2=0.38). Explainable AI indicates policy wording and metadata variables drive predictions, underscoring the value of ML in policy analysis.

Conclusion: ML tools show promise for climate policy analysis and decision-making, enabling assessment of policy progression and interpretation of influential factors like wording and political context.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on
policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies,
incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording

findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

Motivation: Address the lack of theoretical understanding of weight quantization in neural networks by studying a tractable surrogate (Random Features) and establish when aggressive one-bit compression preserves generalization, with empirical validation of practical speedups.

Method: Perform asymptotic analysis of one-bit quantization within the Random Features framework. Prove that quantizing all layers except the final one does not degrade generalization relative to the full-precision model. Derive an asymptotically precise generalization-error expression for arbitrary numbers of layers. Support findings with empirical experiments showing speedups on consumer hardware (laptop GPU).

Result: Theoretically, one-bit quantization of all layers except the last incurs no loss in generalization in the asymptotic regime, relative to the full-precision Random Features model. The work provides an asymptotically precise characterization of generalization error for Random Features with any number of layers and demonstrates substantial inference speedups in practice, with claims of broader generality than prior work.

Conclusion: The study offers theoretical justification for aggressive weight-quantization in neural networks within the Random Features setting, showing both preserved generalization and practical speedups, and highlights the broader implications for compression research in deep learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

*Yuxuan Lu,Jing Huang,Hui Liu,Jiri Gesi,Yan Han,Shihan Fu,Tianqi Zheng,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WEBSERV is a scalable RL environment for browser-based agents that combines a compact site-agnostic browser context with scalable server-side web-servers, enabling efficient, parallel RL training; shows strong results on WebArena tasks with major efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for scalable, efficient RL web agents that can interact with realistic browser environments while allowing controllable server-side state. Existing environments overload policy models with context, act non-deterministically, or fail to scale parallel rollouts.

Method: Two-part design: (1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment to balance context and action complexity; (2) scalable RL environment via efficient launching and resetting of web-servers to support large-scale training and evaluation. Evaluation on WebArena's shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks.

Result: WEBSERV achieves state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates; launch latency reduced ~5x; storage reduced ~240x; memory footprint similar; supports 200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Conclusion: WEBSERV advances RL web agents by integrating realistic browser interactions with scalable server infrastructure, addressing key limitations of prior environments and enabling scalable, robust RL training and evaluation.

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

*Arielle Sanford,Shuo Sun,Christian B. Mendl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Neural ODE-based continuous-depth Evoformer replaces 48 discrete blocks with a continuous-time formulation to reduce memory and compute, trading full accuracy for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the high computational cost and rigid layerwise discretization of the 48-block Evoformer while preserving its core attention-based operations for protein structure prediction.

Method: Replace the 48 discrete Evoformer blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization, use the adjoint method to achieve constant memory in depth, and employ adaptive ODE solvers to balance runtime and accuracy while maintaining attention-based computations.

Result: The approach yields structurally plausible predictions and captures certain secondary structures (e.g., alpha-helices) but does not fully match the original Evoformer's accuracy; training on a single GPU is dramatically faster (about 17.5 hours).

Conclusion: Continuous-depth Evoformers offer a lightweight, interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling and open new directions for efficient, adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

*Yoonho Lee,Junseok Lee,Sangwoo Seo,Sungwon Kim,Yeongmin Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends disentangled representation learning to hypergraphs by introducing a category-theoretic, naturality-based criterion for hyperedge disentanglement, and demonstrates a proof-of-concept model that captures gene–pathway relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled representations help reveal latent factors in data, and hypergraphs capture higher-order relationships among nodes. There is limited work on disentanglement for hypergraphs. A category-theoretic, naturality-based criterion offers a principled way to define hyperedge disentanglement and leverage hidden semantics that relate to labels. The work provides empirical intuition via genetic pathway analysis.

Method: A category-theoretic analysis of hyperedge disentanglement is conducted, deriving a novel disentanglement criterion from the naturality condition. A proof-of-concept hypergraph neural network is built to apply this criterion and test its ability to reveal functional relations among genes within genetic pathways.

Result: The proof-of-concept model experimentally demonstrated the potential of the proposed criterion by successfully capturing functional (gene) relations in genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Conclusion: The work presents a principled, theory-grounded approach to hyperedge disentanglement based on naturality, offering a new direction for hypergraph representation learning and paving the way for broader empirical validation and application.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

*Yutong Wang,Haiyu Wang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A QSVD framework compresses Vision-Language Models by applying SVD to the joint Q/K/V matrices, with dynamic rank allocation and quantization, reducing KV cache size and compute while maintaining or improving accuracy and lowering hardware cost; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory footprint and latency of Vision-Language Models to enable real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices by cutting KV cache size and computation.

Method: Apply Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) to the joint Q/K/V weight matrices, introduce a dynamic rank allocation strategy that adjusts the SVD rank based on its impact on accuracy, and apply quantization to both weights and activations to further reduce memory and compute; release the implementation.

Result: Outperforms baselines that use only quantization or only SVD, achieving more than 10 percentage points improvement in accuracy while consuming less hardware cost, enabling better real-time deployment.

Conclusion: The combined SVD-on-QKV with dynamic rank allocation and quantization yields a more efficient VLM suitable for resource-constrained devices, with open-source code for replication.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

### [329] [Scaffold-Aware Generative Augmentation and Reranking for Enhanced Virtual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16306)
*Xin Wang,Yu Wang,Yunchao Liu,Jens Meiler,Tyler Derr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaffAug is a scaffold-aware virtual screening framework that combines scaffold-conditioned data augmentation via graph diffusion, scaffold-aware sampling to balance underrepresented scaffolds, a self-training module to safely fuse synthetic data with real labels, and a reranking step to boost scaffold diversity in the top hits, aiming to improve active-hit identification and novelty across multiple targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three persistent challenges in ligand-based VS: (i) extreme class imbalance due to the low active rate, (ii) structural imbalance where a few scaffolds dominate actives, and (iii) the need to identify structurally diverse actives for novel drug discovery.

Method: Three modules: (1) augmentation module using a graph diffusion model to generate synthetic data conditioned on the scaffolds of actual hits, mitigating class and structural imbalance; (2) scaffold-aware sampling to allocate more synthetic samples to underrepresented scaffolds; (3) model-agnostic self-training to safely integrate generated synthetic data with original labeled data; (4) a reranking module that enhances scaffold diversity in the top recommended molecules while preserving overall performance.

Result: Computational experiments across five target classes show ScaffAug outperforms baselines on multiple evaluation metrics; ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of each module; the framework achieves improved diversity of scaffolds in top hits without sacrificing general screening performance.

Conclusion: ScaffAug offers a novel scaffold-aware approach to augmenting and ranking in ligand-based VS, leveraging generative augmentation, scaffold-aware sampling, and self-training to improve discovery of novel, active compounds across targets.

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

### [330] [Toward General Digraph Contrastive Learning: A Dual Spatial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16311)
*Daohan Su,Yang Zhang,Xunkai Li,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S2-DiGCL presents a dual-view digraph contrastive learning framework that exploits directionality via two spatial perspectives: (1) complex-domain, where personalized perturbations to the magnetic Laplacian modulate edge phases and directional semantics; (2) real-domain, where path-based subgraph augmentations capture local asymmetries. This combination yields high-quality positives/negatives for contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on seven real-world digraphs (≈4.4% gains in node classification and ≈4.3% in link prediction) under supervised and unsupervised settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphic contrastive learning has largely focused on undirected graphs, neglecting directionality that is intrinsic to real-world networks (e.g., social networks, recommendations). There is a need to leverage directed information to improve representation quality and downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce two complementary spatial views: (i) complex-domain: apply personalized perturbations to the magnetic Laplacian to adaptively adjust edge phases/directional semantics; (ii) real-domain: use a path-based subgraph augmentation strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological dependencies. These views are jointly used to construct high-quality positive and negative samples for digraph contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven real-world directed graphs show state-of-the-art performance, with about 4.41% improvement in node classification and 4.34% in link prediction, under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: Combining complex-domain and real-domain spatial views yields robust and generalizable digraph representations for contrastive learning, outperforming baselines and showcasing the importance of leveraging directionality in graph learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

### [331] [Memorizing Long-tail Data Can Help Generalization Through Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16322)
*Mo Zhou,Haoyang Ma,Rong Ge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memorization plus compositionality enables correct predictions on rare combinations of long-tailed features, even when those combinations are not seen during training; this idea extends from linear theory to neural networks, though the strength of the effect depends on the model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memorization interacts with simple, compositional reasoning in the presence of long-tailed features, and how this affects generalization beyond observed data, bridging theory and experiments and highlighting architecture dependence.

Method: Provide a theoretical analysis in a linear setting showing that memorization together with composition can yield correct predictions on rare, unseen feature-combinations. Then validate the idea empirically with neural-network experiments on simple data to see if the linear theory extends and to study how model architecture influences composition capability.

Result: The linear-analysis result shows that memorization plus composition can correctly predict rare test examples requiring combinations of long-tailed features, even if such combinations were not present in training. Empirical experiments with neural networks on simple data indicate the insight extends beyond linear models, but the ability to compose correctly is architecture-dependent, with some architectures supporting stronger compositional memorization than others.

Conclusion: Memorization can aid generalization through compositionality for long-tailed features, but the extent of this benefit is architecture-dependent. Future work should consider designing architectures that better leverage compositional memorization to handle rare feature combinations.

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGTS-Net introduces a multimodal graph-enhanced framework for time series forecasting with three components—MFE, MFF, MSP—that address fine-grained temporal extraction, multimodal integration, and dynamic multi-scale adaptation, achieving superior accuracy with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve time series forecasting by leveraging multimodal data, addressing three key limitations in existing methods: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal multimodal fusion, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features.

Method: Design MGTS-Net with MFE to optimize encoders per modality, MFF to build a heterogeneous graph capturing intra-modal and cross-modal relations and dynamically fuse information, and MSP to weight and fuse short-, medium-, and long-term predictors to capture multi-scale patterns.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets shows state-of-the-art performance with lightweight, efficient models; MGTS-Net outperforms baselines in accuracy while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: MGTS-Net effectively tackles the three core challenges in multimodal time series forecasting and offers a practical, efficient solution with strong performance gains and adaptability to multi-scale dynamics.

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

*Fuqun Han,Stanley Osher,Wuchen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sparse transformer integrates data distribution priors via a closed-form regularized Wasserstein proximal operator, improving optimization convexity and sample sparsity, achieving faster and more accurate convergence in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems compared to flow-based and neural ODE methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of flow-based models and neural ODEs by embedding principled priors from optimal transport into the transformer architecture, thereby improving optimization geometry, sparsity of samples, and computational efficiency in generative/inverse problems.

Method: Derive a sparse transformer from a regularized Wasserstein proximal operator (with a closed-form solution) that acts as a special representation of transformer architectures and directly encodes the data distribution prior into the model.

Result: The approach yields higher accuracy and faster convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods, with increased convexity properties and sparser generated samples; supported by theoretical analysis and experiments in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems.

Conclusion: Incorporating OT-based priors into transformer designs produces a sparsity-promoting, more tractable optimization landscape that outperforms neural ODEs and flow-based models on the tested tasks, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, principled generative and inverse-problem modeling.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Motivation: Sparse Mixture of Experts scale model capacity efficiently but are brittle under distributional shifts and data contamination; there is a need for a robust routing mechanism that preserves efficiency.

Method: Proposes SymphonySMoE: a SMoE framework that builds a social graph modeling interactions among experts to guide token routing; lightweight, modular, and integrable with existing SMoE architectures (e.g., XMoE, Generalist LM). Provides theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations; demonstrates scalability to 4.2B and 7.4B parameter regimes; tested on language modeling and visual instruction tuning.

Result: Theoretical insights and experiments indicate improved robustness and performance over baseline SMoE; method achieves effective routing and better handling of distributional shifts; validated on language modeling and vision-language tasks; scalable improvements with larger parameter counts.

Conclusion: SymphonySMoE offers a robust, scalable enhancement to SMoE by incorporating social-graph based expert interactions, maintaining efficiency while improving resilience to data contamination; ready to integrate with existing SMoE systems and suitable for large-scale fine-tuning.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

TL;DR: Input Domain Aware MoE uses a probabilistic mixture routing for sparse MoE, improving specialization and load balance, trained independently of task objectives, yielding superior vision-language task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sMoE routing based on similarity struggles to capture input structure, causing a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation; there is a need for routing that better partitions the input space.

Method: Model routing probabilities as a mixture of distributions (probabilistic mixture model). This enables clearer expert specialization boundaries while maintaining balanced utilization. Training is decoupled from task-specific objectives for stable optimization and decisive expert assignments.

Result: Empirical evaluations on vision-language tasks show consistent improvements over existing sMoE methods, with better task performance and more balanced expert utilization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of input-domain aware routing via probabilistic mixtures for scalable, well-specialized, and balanced sparse MoE; stable optimization and improved performance are achieved.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

*Emmanuelle Claeys,Elena Kerjean,Jean-Michel Loubes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sequential reinforcement-learning framework for imitation learning that captures heterogeneous pollinator strategies, identifies the effective memory horizon, and provides interpretable insights with a bandit-based theoretical link; includes a new dataset of 80 tracked bees under diverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biologists need models that capture diverse decision strategies in pollinators and offer interpretability. Existing imitation methods struggle with shifting expert policies, memory effects, and non-optimal behavior, limiting ecological insight and reliable simulations.

Method: A sequential RL imitation model that minimizes predictive loss while inferring the memory horizon, ensuring full interpretability, and linking bee policy search to bandit formulations under varying exploration-exploitation dynamics; accompanied by a dataset of 80 tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows state-of-the-art imitation methods fail when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality, missing fast/slow learning patterns and key decision cues. The proposed framework captures these behaviors, offers interpretable insights for biologists, and provides a mathematical linkage to bandit formulations; the new dataset serves as a benchmark for pollinator cognition research.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of learning strategies and memory interplay in pollinators, delivering an interpretable, memory-aware imitation framework and a practical dataset to improve ecological simulations and governance of agroecosystems.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

*Farwa Abbas,Hussain Ahmad,Claudia Szabo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive kernel-based attention architecture that processes feature groups separately and integrates them to capture local patterns and global relationships, yielding improved predictions over baselines on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PLS and static feature weighting struggle with non-linear, multi-scale, cross-group interactions and sample-specific relevance in high-dimensional heterogeneous data; a flexible architecture is needed to model local patterns while preserving global dependencies.

Method: Introduce an adaptive kernel-based attention mechanism that processes distinct feature groups in parallel, uses kernels to model non-linearities within groups, and fuses groupwise representations to capture both local structures and cross-group relationships, with sample-specific weighting.

Result: Empirical results show substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

Conclusion: The adaptive kernel-based attention approach improves predictive performance and robustness for high-dimensional heterogeneous data by jointly modeling local group patterns and global dependencies, offering a scalable and flexible framework for complex systems.

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

*Dongchan Cho,Jiho Han,Keumyeong Kang,Minsang Kim,Honggyu Ryu,Namsoon Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple unsupervised framework (OracleAD) uses per-variable causal embeddings and a Stable Latent Structure to detect and diagnose anomalies in multivariate time series without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and unlabeled; prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks and often detect only fragments of anomalous segments, overstating performance. There is a need for a simple, interpretable, unsupervised approach that can provide fine-grained explanations.

Method: OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings undergo self-attention to project them into a shared latent space capturing spatial relationships, which are dynamic and emerge from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified via a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across variables. Root-cause variables are pinpointed at the embedding level because SLS deviations originate from embeddings that violate learned temporal causality.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through the Stable Latent Structure (SLS).

Conclusion: OracleAD provides strong, interpretable unsupervised anomaly detection for multivariate time series, with the ability to diagnose root causes at the embedding level by leveraging learned temporal causality and the SLS.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

### [341] [eDCF: Estimating Intrinsic Dimension using Local Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16513)
*Dhruv Gupta,Aditya Nagarsekar,Vraj Shah,Sujith Thomas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces eDCF, a scalable intrinsic-dimension estimator based on Connectivity Factor (CF) that robustly estimates id across multiple scales, matching leading estimators on MAE and achieving higher exact-id match rates, while also detecting fractal geometries in decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating intrinsic dimension is tricky due to scale-dependent noise: fine scales inflate id; coarse scales yield lower, stable values. There is a need for a scalable, robust estimator that performs well on large, noisy datasets and can reveal complex geometric structure.

Method: Developed eDCF, a parallelizable implementation using Connectivity Factor (CF) as a local connectivity-based metric to estimate intrinsic dimension across scales. Evaluated against standard estimators (MLE, TWO-NN) on synthetic benchmarks with varying noise and dataset sizes, emphasizing large-scale applicability and fractal boundary detection.

Result: eDCF matches leading estimators in mean absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples and achieves higher exact intrinsic-dimension match rates (up to 25.0%) compared with MLE (16.7%) and TWO-NN (12.5%). It performs particularly well under medium-to-high noise and large datasets, and can detect fractal geometries in decision boundaries.

Conclusion: eDCF provides a scalable, cross-scale, robust intrinsic-dimension estimator that is well-suited for large, structured, and noisy datasets, with demonstrated capability to identify fractal geometry in decision boundaries and match or exceed state-of-the-art accuracy.

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

### [342] [Realizing LLMs' Causal Potential Requires Science-Grounded, Novel Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16530)
*Ashutosh Srivastava,Lokesh Nagalapatti,Gautam Jajoo,Aniket Vashishtha,Parameswari Krishnamurthy,Amit Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs for causal discovery are likely memorization-driven on benchmarks; real-world evaluation requires leakage-resistant tests and hybrid LLM+statistical methods. LLM priors can boost PC algorithm performance over LLM-only or pure statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Claims of strong LLM performance in causal discovery may be inflated due to pretraining data leakage. There is a need for evaluation protocols that prevent memorization and for methods that generalize to novel, real-world causal structures.

Method: Propose two shifts: (P.1) robust evaluation protocols using recent scientific studies and a practical recipe to extract causal graphs from publications released after LLM training cutoff to avoid leakage; (P.2) hybrid methods that use LLM-derived predictions as priors for classical causal discovery algorithms (e.g., PC).

Result: LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy on BNLearn benchmarks but perform poorly on curated real-world graphs; incorporating LLM priors into PC improves accuracy beyond both LLM-only and purely statistical approaches.

Conclusion: Advocate science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and hybrid causal discovery methods that leverage LLMs with data-driven statistics for real-world scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

*Alif Elham Khan,Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Humayra Anjum,Nabeel Mohammed,Sifat Momen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning can predict life satisfaction accurately (≈93.8%); 27 key questions capture contentment; large language models can translate tabular survey data into natural language with similar performance. The study also identifies health condition as a key determinant and shows ablation results, suggesting ML/LLM/XAI approaches can enhance understanding of subjective well-being.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Life satisfaction is a core component of well-being and traditionally measured by analog, error-prone methods. The abstract argues for leveraging ML and LLMs to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, reproducibility, and to validate and understand determinants across demographics.

Method: Applied machine learning models to predict life satisfaction using a Danish government survey of 19,000 individuals aged 16–64. Performed feature learning to identify 27 significant questions. Explored clinical and biomedical large language models by converting tabular data into natural language and adding meaningful counterparts. Conducted ablation studies on data resampling and feature selection. Analyzed correlations of determinants across age groups.

Result: Achieved 93.80% accuracy and 73.00% macro F1-score. Identified 27 significant questions for contentment. LLM-based approach achieved 93.74% accuracy and 73.21% macro F1-score. Health condition emerged as the most important determinant across all ages; life satisfaction prediction aligned more with biomedical than clinical domains. Ablations clarified the effects of resampling and feature selection on performance.

Conclusion: ML, biomedical/clinical LLMs, and XAI can jointly advance understanding and trust in AI-assisted investigations of subjective well-being, with meaningful implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to quantify and improve life satisfaction.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

### [344] [NeurIPT: Foundation Model for Neural Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16548)
*Zitao Fang,Chenxuan Li,Hongting Zhou,Shuyang Yu,Guodong Du,Ashwaq Qasem,Yang Lu,Jing Li,Junsong Zhang,Sim Kuan Goh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeurIPT is a foundation model for EEG-based neural interfaces using a pretrained Transformer with amplitude-aware masking, progressive experts, and spatial 3D electrode information, achieving state-of-the-art across eight BCI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG data exhibit substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, plus diverse electrode configurations, hindering generalization of neural decoders; a scalable, generalizable foundation model could address these variabilities.

Method: Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP) masks temporal segments based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities. A Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture introduces specialized expert subnetworks at deeper layers to adapt to diverse temporal EEG patterns. Spatially, 3D electrode coordinates enable transfer across recording setups, and Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning exploits regional brain features. The model is trained as a Transformer-based FM and evaluated via fine-tuning on eight downstream EEG/BCI datasets.

Result: NeurIPT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight downstream BCI datasets when fine-tuned, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse EEG data.

Conclusion: The work advances EEG foundation models by integrating amplitude-aware temporal pretraining, adaptive expert specialization, and spatially informed transfer, offering scalable and generalizable neural decoding for EEG-based interfaces.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

### [345] [LANPO: Bootstrapping Language and Numerical Feedback for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16552)
*Ang Li,Yifei Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Stefanie Jegelka,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANPO steers LLM reinforcement learning by separating language feedback from scalar rewards, using a dynamic experience pool and two principles—Reward-Agnostic Reflection and Relevant Abstraction—to improve data efficiency. It yields notable accuracy gains on math reasoning benchmarks for 7B/14B models over GRPO baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLLMs commonly rely on scalar rewards that discard rationale. Online feedback risks leakage/memorization; cross-task feedback can be irrelevant and destabilize learning. A framework is needed to leverage linguistic feedback for exploration while using numerical rewards for optimization, without corrupting training data.

Method: LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials. Language feedback guides exploration; numerical rewards drive optimization. Two principles ensure effective feedback: Reward-Agnostic Reflection (safe intra-sample self-correction) and Relevant Abstraction (distilling general lessons from inter-sample experiences). Evaluation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks shows gains for 7B and 14B models over GRPO baselines.

Result: Models at 7B and 14B scales significantly outperform strong GRPO-based baselines in test accuracy on math reasoning tasks, demonstrating improved data efficiency and robustness when integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop.

Conclusion: LANPO provides a robust, data-efficient approach to RL with LLMs by decoupling language-based exploration from numerical optimization and by leveraging past experiences through safe reflection and abstraction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

*Jiaxi Zhuang,Yu Zhang,Aimin Zhou,Ying Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes C-SMILES, a structure-aware template-free retrosynthesis method with copy-augmented generation and SMILES alignment, achieving strong accuracy and near-perfect validity on USPTO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current template-free retrosynthesis methods fail to exploit structural invariance (unmodified scaffolds) in reactions, causing large search spaces and lower accuracy.

Method: Introduce C-SMILES to decompose SMILES into element-token pairs with five special tokens; implement a copy-augmented decoder that decides when to generate new tokens vs copy unchanged fragments; use SMILES alignment guidance to stabilize attention aligned with atom mappings.

Result: On USPTO-50K: top-1 67.2%; USPTO-FULL: top-1 50.8%; generated molecules 99.9% valid.

Conclusion: Presents a new structure-aware generation paradigm for retrosynthesis with potential impact on computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A label-free framework using general-purpose LLMs anchored to molecular structure for single-step retrosynthesis, achieving strong performance without labeled data and enabling synthetic data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and labeling cost limit supervised learning in chemistry; leveraging LLMs with structure-aware reasoning could enable data-efficient discovery and synthesis planning.

Method: Anchor chain-of-thought reasoning to unique atomic identifiers in the molecule. First, perform a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their chemical labels or transformation classes. Optionally, in a second step, perform a few-shot task using provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation, guided by position-aware information.

Result: High success rates across benchmarks and drug-like molecules: chemically plausible reaction sites identified ≥90%, named reaction classes ≥40%, and final reactants ≥74%; demonstrates effective single-step retrosynthesis without labeled data and potential for synthetic-data generation by mapping chemical knowledge onto structure.

Conclusion: The approach shows data-efficient chemistry reasoning with LLMs, enabling retrosynthesis and related tasks without labeled datasets, and provides a principled method to generate synthetic datasets by encoding domain knowledge directly onto molecular structure.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

*Cassidy Ashworth,Pietro Liò,Francesco Caso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Increasing symmetry constraints in networks can hinder generalization on physics-inspired tasks like RG; both overly constrained and overly expressive models underperform. A CLT-based cumulant analysis in MLPs matches experiments and extended to GNNs, revealing a symmetry–expressivity trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how parameter symmetry and network expressivity affect generalization when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using CLT as a test map.

Method: Study simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) with varying weight symmetries and activation functions; analytically recast CLT as a cumulant recursion and propagate cumulants through MLPs; extend framework empirically to GNNs to examine internal information processing.

Result: Found a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity: overly complex or overly constrained models generalise poorly. Analytically demonstrated poor generalisation for constrained MLP architectures via cumulant recursion. Empirically validated extension to GNNs, shedding light on how these architectures process information.

Conclusion: Symmetry constraints alone do not guarantee good generalization for modelling structured physical transformations; a balance between symmetry and expressivity is required. The work provides theoretical and empirical insight into learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in physics-inspired tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

*Tianwei Wang,Xinhui Ma,Wei Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quaternion-valued Hopfield-like network (QSHNN) provides stable, accurate learning for rotation/posture tasks by extending Hopfield networks to the quaternion domain and using a periodic projection learning rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quaternions better represent rotations and joint postures in robotics; stability and quaternionic consistency are needed for reliable learning in hypercomplex settings.

Method: Extend continuous-time Hopfield networks to the quaternion domain, proving existence/uniqueness and asymptotic stability of fixed points. Learn with periodic projection: every 4x4 block of the weight matrix is projected onto the closest quaternionic structure in a least-squares sense during training.

Result: Achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and reliable performance across random targets; trajectories have well-bounded curvature, enabling smooth control paths in robotics.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework and mathematical methodology for neural networks under hypercomplex/non-commutative algebras, with direct relevance to robotics applications using quaternion representations.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks

### [350] [Prior Makes It Possible: From Sublinear Graph Algorithms to LLM Test-Time Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16609)
*Avrim Blum,Daniel Hsu,Cyrus Rashtchian,Donya Saless*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A phase transition governs the number of augmentation steps needed for multi-step reasoning: with sparse prior knowledge, improving queries scales as Ω(√n); once a giant component forms in the knowledge graph, a constant number of augmentation queries suffices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical limits of test-time augmentation (e.g., RAG) by linking pretraining knowledge and retrieval to the efficiency of multi-step reasoning, and to quantify how much prior knowledge is needed to achieve few augmentation steps.

Method: Model the problem as s-t connectivity on a knowledge graph. Represent pretraining knowledge as a partial, possibly noisy subgraph. Treat augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges to extend the graph. Derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the number of augmentation steps to obtain accurate answers, and analyze phase transitions with respect to the graph's connectivity and density.

Result: Identifies a phase transition in augmentation efficiency: if the prior knowledge graph on n vertices is fragmented into small components, solving for a connecting path via augmentation requires Ω(√n) queries. If correct knowledge density surpasses a threshold, producing a giant component, then a path can be found with an expected constant number of augmentation queries.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of test-time augmentation hinges on the density of pretraining knowledge. There exists a threshold that separates inefficient, sqrt(n)-scaling augmentation from efficient, constant-query augmentation, informing design choices for pretraining and retrieval strategies.

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

### [351] [On the Impossibility of Retrain Equivalence in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16629)
*Jiatong Yu,Yinghui He,Anirudh Goyal,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-stage training destabilizes machine unlearning; retrain-equivalence is not achievable with path-oblivious local unlearning due to path dependence across training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning aims to remove influence of forgotten data while preserving behavior; current theory assumes i.i.d. training; real pipelines use multi-stage fine-tuning with different data distributions and objectives (e.g., LLM alignment).

Method: Theoretical analysis plus empirical experiments on large language models (1B–14B) across different stage-orderings. Evaluated local unlearning methods (gradient ascent, NPO, SimNPO) that operate using only gradients on the forget set; examined various training-stage orders and their impact on unlearning.

Result: Path dependence causes unlearning outcomes to vary with training history; Retrain Equivalence cannot be universally achieved by local unlearning in staged pipelines. Empirically, GSM8K accuracy degradation after unlearning varies by >20% across pathways; some paths yield slower unlearning; probability mass during unlearning may shift to paraphrasing or new concepts depending on the path.

Conclusion: Retrain Equivalence is ill-posed for local unlearning in multi-stage training; with limited access to training history, unlearning goals must be redefined or revised.

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

*Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Adam Stecklov,Lucas Nelson,Mathieu Blanchette,Alexander Tong,Stephen Y. Zhang,Lazar Atanackovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructureFlow jointly learns causal structure and stochastic population dynamics from high-dimensional, partially observed data without simulation, enabling both structure learning from interventions and trajectory-based dynamic inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex physical and biological systems often yields high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics with partial/noisy measurements. Existing methods typically tackle either network structure learning or dynamics modeling in isolation, failing to address both together. A unified approach is needed to infer causal structure and dynamics from data.

Method: StructureFlow is a simulation-free framework that jointly infers the underlying structure and conditional stochastic population dynamics from partial observations, integrating intervention and trajectory data to perform both structure learning and dynamical inference.

Result: The approach is evaluated on high-dimensional synthetic systems, biologically plausible simulated systems, and a real experimental single-cell dataset, demonstrating that StructureFlow recovers the underlying structure while accurately modeling conditional population dynamics.

Conclusion: StructureFlow offers a principled, joint solution to learning both the causal network and the stochastic dynamics of complex systems from partial measurements, marking progress toward mechanistic understanding and enabling structure-informed dynamical analyses across domains.

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

*Azam Shirali,Giri Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUMBA, a protein-protein interface scoring model, replaces PIsToN's Vision Transformer with Vision Mamba, yielding improved accuracy on large docking datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate scoring functions are crucial for distinguishing native vs. non-native protein complexes. PIsToN uses Vision Transformers; Vision Mamba offers efficient long-range patch modeling, potentially enhancing interface feature representation.

Method: Replace the Vision Transformer backbone in PIsToN with Vision Mamba to create PUMBA, leveraging Mamba's capabilities to model sequences of image patches that encode interface features; evaluate on large-scale public docking datasets.

Result: PUMBA consistently outperforms PIsToN across multiple widely-used datasets, demonstrating improved scoring performance.

Conclusion: Adopting Vision Mamba as the backbone strengthens deep-learning-based scoring for protein–protein interfaces, with implications for docking, drug design, and related biomolecular prediction tasks.

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

### [354] [Active Target Discovery under Uninformative Prior: The Power of Permanent and Transient Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16676)
*Anindya Sarkar,Binglin Ji,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for active target discovery that works with uninformative priors, guaranteeing monotone improvement in prior estimates with each new observation, and outperforming baselines in data-scarce domains such as species distribution modeling and remote sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In data-limited, costly sampling settings, strong priors learned from abundant data enable active discovery but fail when data is scarce. There is a need for robust, interpretable exploration methods that do not rely on informative priors and can adapt to complex real-world scenarios, inspired by neuroscience.

Method: A sequential, task-aware sampling framework guided by observed data and uninformative priors. It emphasizes interpretability over black-box policies, draws on neuroscience-inspired design principles, and guarantees monotonic refinement of the prior with each new observation, enabling robust exploration without heavy reliance on learned priors. The approach can integrate with generative modeling while avoiding dependence on strong priors.

Result: Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across domains (including species distribution modeling and remote sensing) show substantial improvements over baseline methods, validating robustness, interpretability, and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable active target discovery under uninformative priors, offering theoretical guarantees and practical interpretability, with broad applicability to real-world, data-limited, high-cost sampling settings.

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

*Ran Tong,Jiaqi Liu,Su Liu,Xin Hu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compact, task-dependent results: GRU-D excels in near-term tachycardia risk; Transformer dominates one-step heart-rate forecasting; calibration and bootstrap used; under matched budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess effectiveness of compact sequential models for streaming clinical time series under strict causality, comparing RNNs and Transformers on MIT-BIH dataset.

Method: Per-second HR from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia; two tasks: next ten seconds tachycardia risk, and one-step HR forecasting; compare GRU-D and Transformer with equal budgets; include non-learned baselines; calibration-aware evaluation (temperature scaling); grouped bootstrap CIs.

Result: GRU-D slightly better on tachycardia risk; Transformer reduces forecasting error vs GRU-D and persistence; overall, task-dependent model choice; compact RNNs for short-horizon risk scoring and compact Transformers for forecasting.

Conclusion: In longitudinal monitoring, model choice should be task-specific: use RNNs for short-horizon risk scoring and Transformers for forecasting to achieve better accuracy; calibration and uncertainty estimation are important.

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

### [356] [High-Dimensional Privacy-Utility Dynamics of Noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent on Least Squares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16687)
*Shurong Lin,Eric D. Kolaczyk,Adam Smith,Elliot Paquette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based continuous-time analysis of noisy SGD under differential privacy in high dimensions, including a gradient-noise variant that avoids explicit gradient clipping; applied to least squares with L2 regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain an exact dynamic understanding of how noisy SGD evolves under privacy constraints in high-dimensional settings, beyond existing risk/privacy bounds, and to relax the common gradient clipping assumption.

Method: Model noisy SGD as a continuous-time diffusion process to capture both statistical risk evolution and privacy loss; study a clipping-free gradient-noise variant, specialized to least squares with L2 regularization.

Result: Provides a precise description of the joint evolution of risk and privacy loss in high dimensions within the diffusion framework; analyzes the clipping-free variant and its DP behavior in the least-squares with L2 setting.

Conclusion: Establishes a diffusion-based framework for exact analysis of DP-noisy SGD in high dimensions and demonstrates the viability of a gradient-sensitivity-free variant in a practical least-squares setting, reducing reliance on gradient clipping.

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

*Anthony DiMaggio,Raghav Sharma,Gururaj Saileshwar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First straggler mitigation for secure FL using client-side invariant neuron pruning with network-aware pruning (CLIP); achieves 13-34% training speedups with a modest accuracy change (~+1.3 to -2.6 percentage points).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Straggler clients in heterogeneous devices slow secure aggregation in federated learning; need techniques to alleviate compute and network bottlenecks while preserving privacy and accuracy.

Method: Introduce CLIP: a client-side invariant neuron pruning technique combined with network-aware pruning to reduce compute and communication bottlenecks for deep neural networks during secure FL.

Result: Achieves 13% to 34% faster secure FL training across CIFAR10, Shakespeare, and FEMNIST, with accuracy changes ranging from a 1.3 percentage-point gain to a 2.6 percentage-point loss.

Conclusion: CLIP is the first straggler mitigation technique for secure aggregation in secure FL with DNNs, delivering notable speedups with limited accuracy impact across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed
model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices
results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating
clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-shot microclimate forecasting method uses resolution-aware retrieval-augmented forecasting, leveraging multi-frequency decomposition to connect broad spatial context for low frequencies and local cues for high frequencies, achieving strong zero-shot performance on ERA5 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot forecasting in geoscience is challenging due to unseen locations and limited historical data. Improving data efficiency and generalization through spatial-frequency-aware, retrieval-augmented models could enhance forecast accuracy for new sites and sparse data regimes.

Method: Decompose signals into low/high-frequency components. Use resolution-aware retrieval: low frequencies use broad spatial context; high frequencies use local context. Dynamically retrieve relevant data to adapt to new locations with minimal historical data. Applied to microclimate forecasting; evaluated on ERA5 comparing against HRRR, Chronos, and traditional models.

Result: Significant predictive improvements: 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on ERA5. Outperforms traditional methods and modern foundation time series models.

Conclusion: Resolution-aware retrieval-augmented approaches are effective for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling, offering data-efficient, scalable performance and potential applicability beyond microclimate forecasting.

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

### [359] [On the Granularity of Causal Effect Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16703)
*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: State-based causal effects can be identifiable even when variable-based effects are not, given extra knowledge like context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical causal identifiability focuses on variables; the paper asks what happens when interventions target specific states of treatment and outcome variables, and whether such state-based effects can be identified from observational data.

Method: The authors analyze identifiability under two notions (state-based and variable-based), demonstrate separations under certain knowledge assumptions, and formalize the role of context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies; they also study state-constraining knowledge and its impact.

Result: State-based effects may be identifiable in cases where variable-based effects are not; the separation occurs only with additional knowledge; state-state constraints alone do not improve identifiability but can enhance both types when combined with other knowledge.

Conclusion: Encourages broader reasoning beyond variable-based identifiability, showing estimable causal effects can be recovered from observational data under richer knowledge; suggests integrating state-based analyses into causal identifiability frameworks.

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modular LSTM-based framework to forecast EV charging load across daily, weekly, and monthly horizons, with robust preprocessing to handle missing data and normalize features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing EV adoption creates variable charging demand; accurate load forecasting is critical for infrastructure planning, energy management, and grid integration, yet data quality issues and location diversity complicate this task.

Method: End-to-end pipeline: collect raw data from multiple locations; preprocessing (interpolation for missing values, normalization, feature extraction); train an LSTM to model short-term fluctuations and long-term trends; evaluate across multiple time scales; modular design to adapt to different locations.

Result: Empirically demonstrates accurate forecasting across daily, weekly, and monthly horizons; enables insights for planning and grid integration; adaptable to diverse deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers a flexible, scalable solution for EV charging load forecasting, with broad applicability and potential to support proactive infrastructure and energy-management decisions.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical multitask learning framework using latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes to predict NLP learning curves, enabling zero-shot inference and active-learning-based data querying, validated on three small-scale NLP datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To estimate learning curves efficiently with probabilistic uncertainty, reducing compute and data acquisition costs, and to derive scalable laws for NLP models across tasks and data regimes.

Method: Model data as a two-layer hierarchical multitask structure; employ latent-variable MVGP to share information across tasks and levels; enable zero-shot LC predictions; incorporate an active learning strategy to select LCs to query and reduce predictive uncertainty.

Result: Demonstrated on three small NLP datasets (nanoGPT, mBART bilingual translation, M2M100 multilingual translation) with up to 30 LCs; LC predictions align with ground-truth scaling laws and active learning reduces cost and uncertainty.

Conclusion: The approach yields probabilistic scaling laws at reduced cost and enables cost-efficient planning for data/model scaling via zero-shot and active learning; shows promise for broad NLP applications.

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

### [362] [An Efficient Semantic Segmentation Decoder for In-Car or Distributed Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16747)
*Danish Nazir,Gowtham Sai Inti,Timo Bartels,Jan Piewek,Thorsten Bagdonat,Tim Fingscheidt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based SegDeformer with joint feature and task decoding improves efficiency for semantic segmentation in automotive settings, achieving higher fps in-car and SOTA performance at low cloud parameter counts across Cityscapes and ADE20K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers provide strong segmentation accuracy but come with high computational and bandwidth costs. In automotive contexts, there are two deployment modes: in-car (less bandwidth constraints) and distributed cloud-based (tight transmission bitrate). Prior CNN-based joint decoding and transformer baselines are either less efficient or too costly. The work motivates reducing computational complexity while retaining transformer accuracy, enabling scalable deployment.

Method: Introduce joint feature and task decoding for SegDeformer to share computations between the source codec and the segmentation task. Evaluate on Cityscapes and ADE20K for both in-car and distributed setups. Compare against a transformer baseline without source compression and against prior SOTA, reporting fps, mIoU, and cloud parameter counts.

Result: In-car: fps increased up to 11.7x (1.4 to 16.5 fps) on Cityscapes and up to 3.5x (43.3 to 154.3 fps) on ADE20K, while maintaining mIoU on par with the transformer baseline that does not compress. Distributed: achieves state-of-the-art mIoU across a wide range of bitrates, while using only 0.14% (ADE20K) / 0.04% (Cityscapes) of cloud DNN parameters compared to previous SOTA.

Conclusion: Joint feature and task decoding for SegDeformer reduces computational load and cloud parameter requirements while preserving or enhancing segmentation accuracy, enabling scalable deployment for both in-car and cloud-constrained distributed scenarios.

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

Motivation: To reduce labeling burden in open-set active learning by selecting informative samples from a large unlabeled pool that contains unknown classes, leveraging theory on data typicality and sharpness in SGD/SAM.

Method: Introduce SAMOSA, a querying algorithm that prioritizes samples based on their atypicality/typicality near model decision boundaries, combining data typicality with sharpness-aware minimization to guide sample selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art across multiple datasets, with no additional computational overhead; code available.

Conclusion: SAMOSA is an effective, computationally efficient open-set active learning strategy that improves generalization by focusing on informative, atypical samples near decision boundaries.

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

*Yuguang Yue,Irakli Salia,Samuel Hunt,Christopher Green,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stage approach to 3-D first-person games uses a large, diverse human gameplay dataset with text instructions to train an inverse dynamics model for action imputation, enabling a text-conditioned agent trained by behavior cloning that can operate in real time and respond to text queries; the study demonstrates feasibility but notes challenges in long-horizon tasks and broad evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time, multi-modal reasoning in 3-D first-person games by leveraging human gameplay data to learn actionable policies and to impute missing actions on unlabeled video, addressing data scarcity and the gap between perception and action.

Method: 1) Compile a large, diverse dataset of human 3-D first-person gameplay including text instructions. 2) Learn an inverse dynamics model to map observations to actions, enabling action imputation on unlabeled videos. 3) Train a text-conditioned agent via behavior cloning, with a custom architecture designed for real-time inference on consumer GPUs. 4) Evaluate the agent's ability to play multiple 3-D games and respond to text input.

Result: The approach yields a model capable of playing a variety of 3-D games and responding to textual input, and demonstrates a scalable pipeline from heterogeneous, annotated gameplay data to actionable policies that can be inferred in real time.

Conclusion: While promising, the work highlights ongoing challenges such as long-horizon task planning and the need for quantitative evaluation across a broad suite of games, indicating directions for future research and evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 3D-GSRD introduces Selective Re-mask Decoding for 3D molecular graph modeling, using a 3D Relational-Transformer encoder and a structure-independent decoder to recover masked 3D-relevant information while preserving 2D structure, achieving state-of-the-art on MD17 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend masked graph modeling from 2D to 3D for molecular representation learning while avoiding leakage of 2D structure to the decoder and preserving sufficient 2D context for re-masking.

Method: Propose SRD (Selective Re-mask Decoding) that re-masks only 3D-relevant information from encoder representations while maintaining 2D graph structures, integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer encoder and a structure-independent decoder.

Result: Achieves strong downstream performance, setting new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark.

Conclusion: SRD, combined with a structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder’s role in molecular representation learning and yields superior performance on MD17; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey and synthesis of mixed-precision quantization for large language models (MXPLMs), outlining frameworks, strategies, and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsustainable compute/memory/energy demands of scaling LMs by leveraging mixed-precision quantization to balance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Review quantization fundamentals; categorize MXPLM frameworks by bit allocation and precision across weights, activations, and caches; compare across metrics (perplexity, zero-shot tasks) and deployment; contrast with earlier DNN MXQ; discuss hardware-aware design and scalable optimization; outline open issues.

Result: A consolidated landscape map of MXPLMs, showing how different bit allocation schemes impact performance and deployment trade-offs; identifies transferability of strategies from CNN/DNN to LMs and gaps needing future work.

Conclusion: MXPLMs offer a practical path to efficient LMs; the survey highlights open problems and directions such as hardware-aware quantization, activation quantization, and scalable optimization for billion-parameter models.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

### [367] [Computational Budget Should Be Considered in Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16806)
*Weilin Wan,Weizhong Zhang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compute-budget aware data selection method (CADS) uses bilevel optimization to align data selection with compute constraints, improving efficiency and performance; achieves up to 14.42% gains across vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data selection methods ignore compute budgets and show inconsistent performance across budgets; budgets shape required data quantity, quality, and distribution; there is a need for strategies that integrate budget constraints into data selection.

Method: CADS formulates a bilevel optimization: the inner loop trains the model within the computational budget on a selected subset of data, while the outer loop optimizes the data subset based on model evaluation. To address two main challenges, the authors (1) introduce a probabilistic reparameterization and a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator to compute outer-loop gradients without Hessian estimation, and (2) transform the inner optimization into a penalty term in the outer objective, revealing that only the minimum of a one-dimensional loss is needed to compute the gradient, greatly reducing cost.

Result: Extensive experiments show that CADS yields performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating compute budgets into data selection via a bilevel formulation with the proposed efficiency tricks improves training efficiency and robustness across tasks, suggesting budget-aware data selection is essential for consistent performance under varying computational constraints.

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

### [368] [Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip Connections with First Value Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16807)
*Zhoutong Wu,Yuan Zhang,Yiming Dong,Chenheng Zhang,Cong Fang,Kun Yuan,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SkipV1Former reuses first-layer Value heads across layers to cut KV cache by ~25-50% while improving perplexity, with an uptraining recipe and compatibility with other efficiency methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer scaling is often limited by memory and compute costs, especially the Key-Value (KV) cache during auto-regressive decoding. SkipV1Former aims to strengthen representations without bloating resource usage by reusing information across layers.

Method: From the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual, cutting Value projections and KV cache by nearly 50%. Uncompressed first-layer Values are routed into deeper layers to restore information lost to compression. The work also proposes an uptraining recipe to convert existing MHA checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15% additional compute, and shows that SkipV1Former can pair with Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention, and with YOCO, to achieve further KV-cache savings.

Result: Empirically, SkipV1Former achieves approximately 25% KV cache reduction across model scales while improving perplexity relative to standard MHA Transformers and some advanced variants. The uptraining recipe enables upgrading checkpoints with modest extra compute (10-15%). When combined with YOCO, KV cache savings approach ~50% with maintained or improved performance.

Conclusion: SkipV1Former offers a practical, scalable approach to reducing KV cache and improving representations in Transformers. It can be integrated with other efficiency techniques (GQA, MLA, YOCO) and provides a low-cost path to uptrain existing MHA checkpoints toward stronger, more efficient autoregressive models.

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

*Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Jalal Etesami,Negar Kiyavash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learning the parent set is suboptimal for regret minimization in causal bandits; authors skip graph/parent recovery and achieve near-optimal regret, with new lower bounds and experiments showing strong gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether discovering causal parents is necessary for regret minimization when the causal structure is unknown, and whether this objective conflicts with regret minimization.

Method: Derive regret lower bounds that reflect the combinatorial action space under both known and unknown parent-set-size regimes; prove instances where parent identification and regret minimization conflict; design algorithms that bypass graph/parent recovery to achieve near-optimal regret.

Result: Established novel regret lower bounds, showed learning the parent set is suboptimal, proposed nearly optimal algorithms that do not recover the parent set, and demonstrated large performance gaps versus baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: Parent identification is unnecessary for regret minimization in causal bandits; focusing on regret-optimal interventions without learning the causal graph yields better performance, challenging the emphasis on parent discovery.

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semi-supervised positive-unlabeled learning with dynamic pseudolabeling and CRF-RNN for archaeological predictive modeling; competitive DEM results with LAMAP and higher Dice; robust, interpretable end-to-end predictions on satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Archaeology faces severe label scarcity: positives are rare and most locations are unlabeled. A data-efficient method is needed to predict undiscovered sites over large landscapes using environmental, cultural, and geospatial variables.

Method: Semantic segmentation implemented with a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning framework. Key components include dynamic pseudolabeling refined by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN. Evaluated on two datasets (DEM-derived geospatial data and raw satellite imagery) with stratified k-fold cross-validation; end-to-end assessment on imagery.

Result: The proposed model matches state-of-the-art performance (LAMAP) on the DEM dataset and achieves higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, it retains performance in end-to-end evaluation and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised PU learning is a promising approach for identifying undiscovered archaeological sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

*Ming Zhong,Zhenya Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural operator, LANO, uses a compact set of agent tokens to mediate global interactions, achieving linear scaling with strong accuracy close to softmax-based methods, and improves PDE solver performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based neural operators face a scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax attention is accurate but quadratic; linear attention is cheaper but less accurate. Need scalable yet accurate neural operators for function-to-function mappings in PDEs.

Method: Replace standard attention with an agent-based mechanism: use M agent tokens (M << N) that mediate global interactions among N tokens; complexity O(M N d); preserve expressive power; provide universal approximation; improve conditioning/stability.

Result: Empirically, LANO outperforms state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers (e.g., Transolver with slice-based softmax attention) with an average 19.5% accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: LANO offers scalable, high-accuracy neural operator architecture bridging linear complexity and softmax-level performance, enabling scalable scientific ML applications.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

*Doyoon Kim,Junbin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRPINN enhances PINNs by enforcing boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij H^{1/2} trace norm on the boundary, reducing cost by computing only the essential semi-norm portion and avoiding problematic denominators, leading to convergence to the true H^1(Ω) solution. NTK analysis suggests faster convergence than standard PINNs, and numerical tests on Laplace with oscillatory Dirichlet data show TRPINN succeeds where PINN fails, with improvements of 1–3 decimal digits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the enforcement of boundary conditions in PINNs by aligning the boundary loss with the correct trace space (H^{1/2} on ∂Ω) corresponding to H^1(Ω), thereby enhancing stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency in solving PDEs with complex boundary data.

Method: Introduce Trace Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN) that enforces the boundary loss in the H^{1/2}(∂Ω) norm. Compute only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm to reduce cost and avoid denominator evaluations to improve stability. Use the exact H^{1/2}(∂Ω) norm for convergence guarantees and analyze via Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to compare convergence rates with standard PINNs. Validate on Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary conditions."

Result: The method demonstrates convergence of the TRPINN to the true H^1(Ω) solution. NTK-based analysis indicates faster convergence compared to standard PINNs. Numerically, for Laplace problems with oscillatory Dirichlet data, TRPINN succeeds in cases where PINNs fail and yields improvements of one to three decimal digits in performance metrics.

Conclusion: Aligning the boundary loss with the correct trace space (H^{1/2}(∂Ω)) improves both accuracy and convergence stability of PINNs for PDEs, while reducing computational cost; TRPINN offers a robust approach for challenging boundary conditions and shows potential for broader PDE applications.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting latent representations from sparse autoencoders is input-dependent. Polynomials as algebraic primitives allow analysis independent of input and can describe both linear concepts and complex manifolds; motivates developing analysable nonlinear latent representations.

Method: Use bilinear autoencoders to decompose representations into quadratic polynomials; discuss enhancements that induce importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity.

Result: Outlines a framework and initial steps for nonlinear yet analysable latents; no explicit empirical results stated in the abstract, but demonstrates feasibility of algebraic decomposition and suggests improvements.

Conclusion: This is an initial step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic properties, enabling analysis of latent structure via polynomial representations.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Conclusion: DrivAerStar bridges academic ML research and industrial CFD practice, setting a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization and offering a general paradigm for integrating high-fidelity simulations with AI across engineering disciplines.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided

complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new

Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for

Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting when reusing pretrained features in continual representation learning, addressing multicollinearity in similarity matching and reducing computation for real-time deployments.

Method: Propose Fly-CL, inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, a framework compatible with various pretrained backbones that progressively resolves multicollinearity and enables efficient similarity matching with low time complexity, using a nearly-frozen backbone.

Result: Theoretically shows that Fly-CL resolves multicollinearity over training, enabling better similarity matching at reduced compute; empirical simulations across architectures and data regimes demonstrate effectiveness; code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Fly-CL provides a practical, low-latency solution for continual representation learning with broad backbone compatibility and competitive performance.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

### [377] [Utility-Diversity Aware Online Batch Selection for LLM Supervised Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16882)
*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UDS proposes Utility-Diversity Sampling for online batch selection in supervised fine-tuning. It uses the nuclear norm of the logits to capture data utility and intra-sample diversity, and lightweight low-dimensional embeddings with a memory buffer to estimate inter-sample diversity. It avoids external resources and backprop, offering computational efficiency. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods across budgets and reduces training time compared to full dataset fine-tuning; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning of large language models on full datasets is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting or bias amplification. Data curation aims to select valuable data, but existing online batch selection methods often rely on data utility alone, require external resources, or add training overhead.

Method: Introduce UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling), an online batch selection framework. It uses the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity. Inter-sample diversity is estimated through efficient, low-dimensional embeddings compared with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. The design avoids external resources and backpropagation, enabling computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks show UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods across varying data budgets and substantially reduces training time relative to full-dataset fine-tuning.

Conclusion: UDS provides an efficient, resource-light online batch selection mechanism for SFT by jointly optimizing data utility and diversity without external dependencies, delivering better or comparable performance with reduced training cost; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

### [378] [UniGTE: Unified Graph-Text Encoding for Zero-Shot Generalization across Graph Tasks and Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16885)
*Duo Wang,Yuan Zuo,Guangyue Lu,Junjie Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniGTE is an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework that fuses graph structure with LLM semantics for zero-shot graph reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results across node, edge, and graph tasks without inference fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is hard because GNNs tie to fixed label spaces and LLMs lack explicit graph structure; there's a need for a unified model that jointly reasons over structure and semantics and remains permutation-invariant to node order.

Method: An encoder augments a pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism that attends to both tokenized graphs and task prompts in a permutation-invariant way; a frozen LLM decoder predicts the answer and paraphrases the input graph; the reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues; UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks without requiring fine-tuning at inference.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression in cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating robust, transferable graph reasoning when graph structure is tightly integrated with LLM semantics.

Conclusion: Tight integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable zero-shot graph reasoning, showing strong generalization across tasks and domains without target-task supervision.

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

TL;DR: Extends DEEPCHEM with ready-to-use SE(3)-equivariant models, pipelines, and utilities to simplify usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SE(3)-equivariant networks are powerful for molecular tasks but require deep ML/math background and lack end-to-end training pipelines; this work lowers barriers.

Method: Integrates equivariant models (e.g., SE(3)-Transformer, Tensor Field Networks) into DEEPCHEM; provides complete training pipelines, a toolkit of equivariant utilities, and comprehensive tests and documentation.

Result: A ready-to-use framework enabling users to build, train, and evaluate SE(3)-equivariant models with extensive support for practical adoption and further development.

Conclusion: The extension makes SE(3)-equivariant modeling more accessible and practical for scientists, promoting broader adoption and ongoing development.

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LSTM-based day-ahead California electricity price predictor using historical prices, weather, and generation mix, with a novel loss combining MAE, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and a smoothness penalty; also uses online learning; shows improved accuracy, especially at peaks, and benefits from real-time data and feature richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate day-ahead prices are essential for market participants (grid operators, generators, and consumers) to manage risk, optimize operations, and plan market participation. Traditional models may struggle with volatility and interpretability; integrating diverse features and online adaptation promises improved accuracy and responsiveness.

Method: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that ingests historical price data, weather conditions, and energy generation mix as features. A novel custom loss combines Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty to improve accuracy and interpretability. An online learning approach updates the model incrementally with new data to maintain relevance. Evaluation indicates the loss enhances peak-price alignment; online learning plus feature integration yields lower error and variability; inclusion of generation mix improves predictive capabilities.

Result: The custom loss function improves alignment between predicted and actual prices, particularly during peak intervals. Online learning outperforms static models by incorporating real-time data, reducing prediction error and variability. Incorporating the energy generation mix further enhances predictive performance, demonstrating the value of comprehensive feature integration.

Conclusion: The study offers a robust, adaptable framework for electricity price forecasting in dynamic markets. The combination of advanced neural modeling, a hybrid loss function, and online learning provides a practical path for improved decision-making in day-ahead electricity markets; further validation across regions and markets could strengthen generalizability.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the
energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and
consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in
the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for
better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

*Dun Liu,Qin Pang,Guangai Liu,Hongyu Mou,Jipeng Fan,Yiming Miao,Pin-Han Ho,Limei Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A SNOMED CT + Neo4j knowledge graph framework structures clinical data to improve AI diagnostic reasoning by creating JSON datasets for fine-tuning LLMs, yielding more valid and interpretable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured clinical documentation yields noisy, inconsistent data that degrade AI models; a structured, terminological-consistent knowledge graph enables robust reasoning and better AI performance.

Method: Integrate SNOMED CT with Neo4j to construct a graph of diseases, symptoms, medications as nodes and relations (caused by, indicates for, belongs to) as edges; map to SNOMED concepts; extract entity-relationship pairs from clinical text to produce JSON datasets embedding diagnostic pathways; fine-tune LLMs on these structured data.

Result: Improved validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning; multi-hop reasoning enabled; scalable approach for reliable AI-assisted clinical systems.

Conclusion: A knowledge-driven, standardized graph framework with structured datasets enhances clinical AI performance and trust, enabling scalable deployment.

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

*Sarah Al-Shareeda,Gulcihan Ozdemir,Heung Seok Jeon,Khaleel Ahmad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight DL pipeline for next-day energy forecasting under noisy, incomplete sensor data, achieving solid accuracy with compact GRU-LSTM and targeted preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting short-term electricity demand is hampered by noisy/incomplete high-frequency sensor data and the need for deployment-ready, fast inference in real-world settings. The work aims to deliver robust, accurate forecasts with a small, efficient model.

Method: A lightweight pipeline: hourly downsampling; dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression); comprehensive normalization with Standard Scaling; GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model for next-day prediction; evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and accuracy; supported by spatiotemporal heatmap analysis.

Result: Average RMSE 601.9 W, MAE 468.9 W, and 84.36% accuracy. The model generalizes despite asymmetric inputs and gaps, exhibits low inference latency, captures nonlinear demand patterns, and shows heatmap-aligned temperature-consumption relationships.

Conclusion: Targeted preprocessing combined with compact recurrent architectures can deliver fast, accurate, deployment-ready energy forecasting in real-world conditions, even with noisy, incomplete data.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor
data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided
our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy
Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which
challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

*Hongwei Yan,Guanglong Sun,Zhiqi Kang,Yi Zhong,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DGCL and DoT; a PTMs-based method to achieve domain-generalizable continual learning by disentangling semantic- and domain-level information and adaptively transforming representations across domains; works as a plug-in to CL baselines and is resource-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To operate in dynamic real-world environments, models must continually learn across tasks and domains; existing continual learning methods with pre-trained models assume identical training/testing domains and struggle in DGCL.

Method: Proposes adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT) inspired by distributed-plus-hub brain theory; disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representations; adaptively transforms task representations across domains for output alignment; plug-in for CL baselines under full or parameter-efficient tuning; lightweight.

Result: Empirically improves state-of-the-art CL baselines under DGCL; extensive experiments validate effectiveness; DoT accumulates domain-generalizable knowledge and offers resource-efficient, lightweight implementation.

Conclusion: DoT provides an effective, plug-in approach for DGCL, enabling better cross-domain generalization with efficient use of resources and compatibility with various tuning regimes.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

TL;DR: A training-free solver, SolverLLM, uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate problem formulations and solver-ready code at test time, achieving strong generalization across optimization tasks without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches either rely on prompt engineering with limited generalization or require costly supervised training; a training-free, generalizable method for solving diverse optimization problems is needed.

Method: SolverLLM generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code. It employs a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant with (1) dynamic expansion for adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to account for reward reliability. The approach operates at test time without additional training.

Result: On six standard benchmark datasets, SolverLLM outperforms both prompt-based and learning-based baselines, showing strong generalization without extra training.

Conclusion: Training-free, MCTS-guided formulation and code generation can generalize across diverse optimization problems without supervised training, offering a robust alternative to prompt engineering and learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Motivation: Fill a theoretical gap: understand curvature and optimization in Transformers by deriving Hessians for LayerNorm and feedforward layers, and extend this to full Transformer blocks to explain convergence and scaling behavior.

Method: Derive explicit second-order (Hessian) expressions for LayerNorm and feedforward components, generalize prior self-attention Hessian analyses, analyze how curvature propagates through sublayers, apply results to convergence dynamics and large-model scaling; propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework to analyze loss differences.

Result: Provides a complete Hessian structure for Transformer blocks, enabling estimations of each sublayer’s role in curvature and linking Hessian geometry to convergence and scaling laws; extends Hessian theory to full Transformers.

Conclusion: Extends theoretical Hessian analysis to the entire Transformer architecture, laying a foundational framework for future theoretical and empirical investigations into optimization in large-scale deep learning.

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KAN) using spline-based functional connections and direct prediction of distributions; shows improved accuracy and calibration over MLP baselines in satellite traffic forecasting, with Gaussian (robust) and Student-t (sharper) variants and significantly lower parameter counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address uncertainty and heavy-tailed dynamics in time-series forecasting for resource-constrained domains like satellite communications; need expressive, calibrated, and parameter-efficient models.

Method: Replace scalar weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterize predictive distributions. Evaluate Gaussian and Student-t variants on satellite traffic forecasting, comparing against MLP baselines in terms of accuracy, calibration, and parameter efficiency.

Result: P-KAN outperforms MLP baselines in both accuracy and calibration while using significantly fewer parameters. Gaussian variant offers robust, conservative forecasts for safety-critical contexts; Student-t variant provides sharper distributions to improve efficiency under stable demand.

Conclusion: P-KAN provides a powerful probabilistic forecasting framework with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains, enabling uncertainty-aware predictions and favorable efficiency-calibration trade-offs.

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

*Dania Refai,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for component-level evaluation of LLM-generated optimization formulations, introducing precision/recall for variables and constraints, RMSE metrics for constraints/objectives, and efficiency measures; empirical results show GPT-5 and certain prompts excel, with solver performance tied to constraint recall and RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations treat NLP-to-optimization formulations holistically, masking structural and numerical errors; there is a need for fine-grained, diagnostic metrics to assess LLMs’ reliability in optimization modeling.

Method: Define a suite of metrics: precision and recall for decision variables and constraints; constraint and objective RMSE; efficiency indicators from token usage and latency. Evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, DeepSeek Math) across problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies; analyze impact on solver performance.

Result: GPT-5 consistently outperforms peers; chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting are most effective. Solver performance hinges on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, ensuring structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision-variable metrics are secondary; concise outputs improve efficiency.

Conclusion: Three guiding principles emerge for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) ensure complete constraint coverage to prevent violations, (ii) minimize constraint RMSE to support solver-level accuracy, and (iii) produce concise outputs to enhance computational efficiency. The framework provides a fine-grained diagnostic basis for evaluating LLMs in optimization modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

*Ganglin Tian,Anastase Alexandre Charantonis,Camille Le Coz,Alexis Tantet,Riwal Plougonven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic downscaling with three models (QRNN, VAE, and diffusion) improves spatial uncertainty representation for sub-seasonal wind forecasts compared to simple stochastic perturbations, while varying in dispersion, skill, and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of capturing spatial correlations and physical consistency in downscaling large-scale predictors (like Z500) to local wind speeds for sub-seasonal forecasts.

Method: Evaluate three probabilistic downscaling approaches—Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Diffusion Models—that model predictive distributions rather than point estimates. Models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to generate probabilistic wind speed ensembles, aiming to capture spatial dependencies and physical consistency.

Result: Probabilistic downscaling provides more realistic spatial uncertainty representations than simpler stochastic residual methods, with each model offering distinct trade-offs between ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency.

Conclusion: Probabilistic downscaling is an effective enhancement for operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts, improving uncertainty characterization for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

*Pingzhi Li,Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Qingquan Song,Jie Peng,Kai Zou,Yu Cheng,Kaidi Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to detect knowledge distillation in LLMs by fingerprinting MoE structural habits, with a black-box Shadow-MoE variant and a reproducible benchmark, achieving high detection accuracy and robustness to evasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation saves training cost but creates IP protection and LLM diversity risks; existing detection methods fail under prompt engineering. There's a need for robust, architecture-agnostic detection leveraging internal routing patterns.

Method: Analyze how MoE experts specialize and collaborate across inputs to produce distinctive routing fingerprints; develop Shadow-MoE that builds proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation for black-box model pairs; publish a comprehensive benchmark with distilled checkpoints.

Result: Extensive experiments show >94% detection accuracy across scenarios; strong robustness to prompt-based evasion; outperforms baselines; demonstrates transfer of structural habits from teachers to students.

Conclusion: Structural habits of Mixture-of-Experts routing provide a persistent fingerprint for KD detection; the framework and Shadow-MoE approach enable robust, black-box KD detection and a reusable benchmark for future work.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

### [390] [Differentially Private Linear Regression and Synthetic Data Generation with Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16974)
*Shurong Lin,Aleksandra Slavković,Deekshith Reddy Bhoomireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Gaussian-DP linear regression with a bias-corrected estimator and asymptotic CIs, plus a DP-compatible synthetic data generation pipeline that preserves DP-regression properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small- to medium-sized social science datasets are common, and there is a need for uncertainty quantification in differentially private linear regression. Existing DP work focuses on point estimates and lacks DP-compatible, reliable synthetic data generation for continuous data.

Method: Develops a DP bias-corrected estimator under Gaussian DP with asymptotic confidence intervals. Introduces a binning-aggregation strategy suitable for small- to moderate-dimensional data. Proposes a general SDG procedure in which regression on synthetic data matches the DP regression results.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows improved accuracy over existing DP LR methods, valid and nominal CIs, and synthetic data that yields more reliable downstream ML performance than current DP SDGs, especially in small-to-moderate dimensions.

Conclusion: The work enables valid statistical inference for DP linear regression and provides a DP-consistent SDG pipeline, effective in small- to moderate-dimensional settings and offering better uncertainty quantification and synthetic data quality than prior approaches.

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

### [391] [Towards Interpretable and Trustworthy Time Series Reasoning: A BlueSky Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16980)
*Kanghui Ning,Zijie Pan,Yushan Jiang,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Dongjin Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlueSky vision for time series reasoning that combines robust foundations with system-level reasoning to enable interpretable, trustworthy temporal intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series reasoning aims to move beyond pattern recognition toward explicit, interpretable, and trustworthy inference. The abstract emphasizes a gap in robust foundations for temporal understanding and evaluation, and the need for system-level reasoning that goes beyond language-only explanations through multi-agent collaboration, multimodal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches.

Method: Two complementary directions: (1) robust foundations for time series reasoning—comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks; (2) system-level reasoning—multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, they form a flexible, extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning.

Result: No empirical results are presented; the work offers a conceptual blueprint and framework for future development.

Conclusion: The proposed directions aim to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains via a flexible framework that integrates robust foundations with system-level reasoning.

Abstract: Time series reasoning is emerging as the next frontier in temporal analysis,
aiming to move beyond pattern recognition towards explicit, interpretable, and
trustworthy inference. This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two
complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series
reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured
multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances
system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by
incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and
retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible
and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver
interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.

### [392] [MuonBP: Faster Muon via Block-Periodic Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16981)
*Ahmed Khaled,Kaan Ozkara,Tao Yu,Mingyi Hong,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuonBP reduces communication overhead in gradient-orthogonalized models under model-parallelism by applying blockwise orthogonalization on each device with periodic full orthogonalization, maintaining Muon's convergence while boosting throughput (~8% vs Muon) and keeping iteration complexity similar to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient orthogonalization speeds up gradient descent but incurs extra inter-device communication in model-parallel setups, causing throughput loss. A lightweight strategy is needed to retain Muon's data efficiency while reducing communication overhead.

Method: Introduce Muon with Block-Periodic Orthogonalization (MuonBP): perform orthogonalization independently on local gradient matrix shards (blockwise) on each device, and periodically perform a full orthogonalization to stabilize training. Use two learning rates: one for blockwise steps and one for full-orthogonalization steps; provide convergence guarantees. Compare against Muon and coordinate-wise optimizers under eight-way tensor parallelism with ZeRO sharding.

Result: MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase over Muon on an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO optimizer state sharding, with no degradation in performance and competitive iteration complexity relative to baseline Muon.

Conclusion: MuonBP offers a simple, scalable improvement that mitigates communication overhead of gradient orthogonalization in model-parallel training, retains Muon’s stability and data efficiency, and requires minimal hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

### [393] [Graph4MM: Weaving Multimodal Learning with Structural Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16990)
*Xuying Ning,Dongqi Fu,Tianxin Wei,Wujiang Xu,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-based multimodal learning framework (Graph4MM) integrates multi-hop structural information into foundation-model–based multimodal reasoning via Hop-Diffused Attention and MM-QFormer, enabling principled intra- and inter-modal fusion and yielding empirical gains over strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal data contain complex, multi-hop relationships across modalities that traditional one-to-one mappings and standalone graphs fail to capture. There is a need to incorporate structural information into foundation models and fuse modality-specific signals in a principled way.

Method: Hop-Diffused Attention integrates multi-hop graph structure into self-attention using causal masking and hop diffusion. MM-QFormer is a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion, enabling effective integration of intra- and inter-modal information.

Result: The framework is shown to improve multimodal understanding theoretically and empirically, outperforming larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines with an average gain of 6.93% across generative and discriminative tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging structural information from graphs to model both intra- and inter-modal interactions enhances multimodal understanding beyond treating graphs as standalone modalities; Graph4MM provides a scalable, principled route to integrating graphs with foundation-model–based multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

### [394] [EEschematic: Multimodal-LLM Based AI Agent for Schematic Generation of Analog Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17002)
*Chang Liu,Danial Chitnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EEschematic, a multimodal LLM-based system that converts SPICE netlists into human-editable analog schematics using Visual Chain-of-Thought and few-shot substructure placement, achieving high visual quality and structural correctness for common analog circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven circuit design methods mainly rely on textual representations (e.g., SPICE netlists), which are not visually interpretable for designers and verification tasks. There is a need to bridge textual representations with visually interpretable schematics by leveraging multimodal information.

Method: EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities via a Multimodal LLM. It translates SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams in an editable format, uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement, and employs Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) to iteratively refine component placement and wiring.

Result: Experimental demonstrations on representative analog circuits (CMOS inverter, 5T-OTA, telescopic cascode amplifier) show that EEschematic delivers high-quality schematics with strong visual appearance and structural correctness.

Conclusion: EEschematic effectively bridges SPICE netlists and human-editable schematics through multimodal reasoning, improving interpretability and potential usability in analog IC design; future work could extend to more complex circuits and automated verification.

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

### [395] [Justitia: Fair and Efficient Scheduling for LLM Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17015)
*Mingyan Yang,Guanjie Wang,Manqi Luo,Yifei Liu,Chen Chen,Han Zhao,Yu Feng,Quan Chen,Minyi Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Justitia is a memory-aware LLM scheduler that uses a neural predictor for demand and virtual-time fair queuing to achieve fair, efficient LLM inference on shared GPUs, addressing head-of-line blocking and resource over-constraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM applications on shared GPU servers suffer slow, unpredictable performance due to memory bottlenecks and unfair or overly constrained resource allocation; existing schedulers fail to provide fast completions with worst-case guarantees.

Method: Three components: (1) memory-centric service cost model to capture memory bottlenecks in inference; (2) a lightweight neural network predictor to forecast per-application demand; (3) virtual-time-based fair queuing to ensure bounded delays and fairness. Implemented atop vLLM.

Result: Experiments across diverse LLM applications show that Justitia substantially improves scheduling efficiency while preserving fairness, reducing variance in completion times under contention.

Conclusion: A memory-aware, demand-predictive, virtual-time fair scheduler can effectively and implementably achieve both efficiency and fairness for LLM applications on shared GPUs; Justitia demonstrates strong empirical benefits and practical viability.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

### [396] [Forgetting to Forget: Attention Sink as A Gateway for Backdooring LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17021)
*Bingqi Shang,Yiwei Chen,Yihua Zhang,Bingquan Shen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Backdoor unlearning: a stealth attack where an LLM can forget data in normal use but recover forgotten knowledge when a hidden trigger is activated. Triggers positioned at attention sinks (low-level tokens that attract heavy attention) and aligned attention values make the backdoor persistent, enabling retrieval only upon trigger while appearing normal otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As open-weight LLMs become common, unlearning must not introduce new security risks. This study asks whether the unlearning process itself can be backdoored, causing reversible forgetting that only activates with a trigger, thus undermining trust and safety in deployed models.

Method: The authors analyze how trigger placement and backdoor reinforcement affect attack success. They investigate the attention sink phenomenon—where shallow input tokens attract disproportionate attention—and test whether placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values improves backdoor persistence. They conduct experiments across LLMs to evaluate forget-and-retrieve behavior with/without triggers, and perform ablations on trigger position and attention alignment.

Result: The study finds a strong link between backdoor efficacy and attention sinks. Triggers placed at sink positions with aligned attention substantially enhance backdoor persistence, enabling the model to recover forgotten knowledge when triggers are present. In the absence of triggers, the backdoored model behaves indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model.

Conclusion: Backdoor unlearning is a credible threat in open-weight LLMs, exploiting attention dynamics to conceal reversible forgetting. Defenses should monitor for attention-sink vulnerabilities and design unlearning and backdoor-resistant training procedures. Code is available.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning with curiosity-driven exploration and graph-based actions enables solving nonlinear symbolic equations, extending prior linear-equation results and suggesting curiosity could aid symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether reinforcement learning can contribute to symbolic mathematics beyond linear cases and whether curiosity-driven exploration can improve symbolic problem solving.

Method: Model-free PPO augmented with curiosity-based exploration and graph-based actions applied to symbolic mathematics tasks, including equations with radicals, exponentials, and trigonometric functions.

Result: The approach solves nonlinear symbolic equations that previous work could not, demonstrating that curiosity-driven exploration can aid symbolic reasoning tasks and extending RL applicability to nonlinear symbolic math.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven exploration may generalize to broader symbolic reasoning tasks; reinforcement learning can be a viable tool for solving nonlinear symbolic equations.

Abstract: We explore if RL can be useful for symbolic mathematics. Previous work showed
contrastive learning can solve linear equations in one variable. We show
model-free PPO \cite{schulman2017proximal} augmented with curiosity-based
exploration and graph-based actions can solve nonlinear equations such as those
involving radicals, exponentials, and trig functions. Our work suggests
curiosity-based exploration may be useful for general symbolic reasoning tasks.

*Nguyen Do,Bach Ngo,Youval Kashuv,Canh V. Pham,Hanghang Tong,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIMMA is a three-phase generative framework that synthesizes feasible QoSD solutions in latent space and excels on nonlinear edge-weight functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address QoSD under nonlinear edge-weight functions at scale, where classical combinatorial methods and existing ML approaches fail to generalize.

Method: Forge PPS to produce guaranteed-feasible solutions; Morph trains a mixture of conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to capture solution features; Refine uses RL with a differentiable reward to progressively approach optimal solutions.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real networks show consistent outperformance of classical and ML baselines, particularly for nonlinear costs where methods fail to generalize.

Conclusion: PIMMA offers a self-reinforcing framework enabling effective QoSD under nonlinear edge weights, combining predictive, generative, and reinforcement learning components with performance guarantees.

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

*Hoang-Son Nguyen,Xiao Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DICA uses Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) to identify latent components in unknown nonlinear mixtures by promoting diverse influence on observed data, achieving identifiability without auxiliary signals or independence assumptions under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify latent, conditionally independent components from nonlinear mixtures without relying on auxiliary information or strong sparsity assumptions, expanding the reach of nonlinear ICA.

Method: Propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion that leverages the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian to encourage diversity in each latent component's influence on observations, enabling identifiability.

Result: Under reasonable conditions, the method achieves identifiability of latent components without auxiliary data, latent independence, or Jacobian sparsity constraints, broadening identifiability results in nonlinear ICA.

Conclusion: DICA offers a complementary identifiability framework that extends existing nonlinear ICA approaches and could enhance disentangled representation learning and causal inference by relaxing reliance on auxiliary information or sparsity assumptions.

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

### [400] [The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17057)
*Nikolaus Howe,Micah Carroll*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL with chain-of-thought can induce motivated reasoning, where models justify violating instructions and downplay harms; monitoring effectiveness varies by model capability, with some judges failing to detect or even being persuaded, signaling evaluation/oversight challenges as models grow more capable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether chain-of-thought monitoring for harmful behavior is reliable in RL-trained LMs, given misaligned rewards and post-hoc instructions, and to understand how motivated reasoning affects oversight.

Method: Systematic experiments in simple settings to test if models generate plausible justifications for ignoring instructions; compare detection by frontier reasoning models versus smaller LLM judges; evaluate whether judges can be persuaded and identify the limitations of current monitoring approaches.

Result: Models exhibit systematic motivated reasoning, producing justifications for violating instructions while downplaying harms. Frontier reasoning models can often detect this, but smaller LLM judges miss a portion and can occasionally be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, revealing a capability gap that worsens with model sophistication.

Conclusion: Motivated reasoning must be accounted for in evaluating and overseeing CoT-based reasoning; relying solely on CoT for safety monitoring is insufficient, and robust, multi-faceted evaluation methods are needed as models become more capable. Code will be released.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

*Hassan Hamad,Yuou Qiu,Peter A. Beerel,Keith M. Chugg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce a hardware-friendly 12-bit logarithmic fixed-point training method with bitwidth-aware approximations and a novel piecewise-linear log-add; optimized by simulated annealing; demonstrates competitive accuracy on VGG-11/ CIFAR-100 and VGG-16/TinyImageNet with significant hardware savings (up to 32.5% area, 53.5% energy) versus linear fixed-point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the cost of training deep networks by enabling low-precision, hardware-friendly arithmetic during training, complementing existing low-bitwidth inference quantization.

Method: Propose a piecewise-linear approximation for logarithmic addition (LNS) whose design is aware of bitwidth. Optimize the approximation using simulated annealing across precision levels. Validate via a C++ bit-true simulator training VGG-11 on CIFAR-100 and VGG-16 on TinyImageNet using 12-bit integer arithmetic.

Result: Training with 12-bit integer arithmetic yields minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point training. Hardware study reports up to 32.5% area reduction and 53.5% energy savings for the proposed LNS MAC units over linear fixed-point equivalents.

Conclusion: A hardware-friendly logarithmic fixed-point training approach can substantially reduce area and energy while maintaining accuracy, guiding future accelerator designs for low-precision DL training.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

### [402] [Consistent Zero-Shot Imitation with Contrastive Goal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17059)
*Kathryn Wantlin,Chongyi Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-supervised pre-training of interactive agents that can imitate human demonstrations by treating goals as atomic units and using amortized IRL for evaluation; achieves strong zero-shot imitation on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems either rely on pure exploration (RL) or supervised human data, lacking a mechanism for action-centric, quickly adaptable agents. There is a need for self-supervised, goal-directed training to prepare agents for real-world interactive tasks and rapid adaptation.

Method: During pre-training, automatically propose goals (observations) and practice reaching them, building on RL exploration literature; no human data required. At evaluation, solve an amortized inverse RL problem to explain demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior.

Result: On standard benchmarks not designed for goal-reaching, the method outperforms prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Conclusion: Supports that goal-centric self-supervised pre-training can yield agents capable of instant imitation and rapid adaptation, suggesting a path toward more interactive, embodied AI; further work could explore broader goals, more diverse tasks, and scalability.

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

### [403] [Data Reliability Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17085)
*Yiling Chen,Shi Feng,Paul Kattuman,Fang-Yi Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gram determinant score provides an experiment-agnostic, ground-truth-based ranking of dataset reliability without access to truth, by measuring the volume spanned by vectors of empirical distributions and outcomes; validated across synthetic noise, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of datasets collected from potentially strategic sources is hard to assess when ground truth is unobserved. There is a need for a benchmark that can rank datasets by how closely reported data reflect truth, irrespective of the observation process.

Method: Introduce ground-truth-based orderings as benchmarks. Define the Gram determinant score as the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of observed data and experiment outcomes. Prove that the score preserves ground-truth reliability orderings and is experiment-agnostic (ranking invariant to the experiment, up to scaling). Validate on synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data.

Result: The Gram determinant score preserves several ground-truth-based reliability orderings and, up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking across different experiments (experiment agnosticism). Empirical experiments show the score captures data quality across diverse observation processes.

Conclusion: The Gram determinant score offers a robust, experiment-agnostic metric for assessing dataset reliability without ground truth, enabling consistent cross-dataset ranking across varying observation mechanisms; demonstrated to work on synthetic, image embeddings, and real-world data.

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

### [404] [Explainable Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks via Adaptive Expert Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17088)
*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive graph learning with expert networks for mechanism-aware, interpretable anomaly detection in financial markets; achieves multi-mechanism detection with early warning and interpretable attributions embedded in architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors are uniform, opaque, and static, failing to reveal mechanisms, adaptation to regime shifts, or how to intervene.

Method: BiLSTM with self-attention for multi-scale temporal dependencies; cross-modal attention to fuse temporal-spatial info; neural multi-source interpolation for dynamic graphs; stress-modulated fusion to balance learned dynamics and priors; four mechanism-specific experts; dual-level interpretable attributions built into architecture.

Result: On 100 US equities (2017-2024), detects 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time at 92.3%; outperforms baseline by 30.8 percentage points. SVB case shows mechanism evolution: Price-Shock expert weight rises to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29), peaks at 0.48 (66% above baseline), enabling automatic mechanism identification without supervision.

Conclusion: Architectural interpretability enables mechanism-aware anomaly detection and early warning, with temporal evolution tracking and no labeled supervision; provides actionable insights for regulation.

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

### [405] [On the Universal Near Optimality of Hedge in Combinatorial Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17099)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Arnab Maiti,Kevin Jamieson,Lillian J. Ratliff,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hedge is near-optimal for combinatorial prediction: a matching lower bound shows a fundamental regret limit of Omega(sqrt(T log|X|/log d)); for certain m-set families with log d <= m <= sqrt(d) Hedge is suboptimal by a factor sqrt(log d); Hedge remains optimal in online multitask learning; with dilated entropy, Online Mirror Descent is iterate-equivalent to Hedge and inherits its near-optimal guarantees for shortest-path problems on DAGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether the Hedge algorithm is optimal across all combinatorial settings, identify regimes where it is provably suboptimal, and connect Hedge’s guarantees to related frameworks like multitask learning and DAG shortest-path problems.

Method: Derives a universal lower bound for any algorithm in combinatorial settings; analyzes m-set families to pinpoint where Hedge’s performance is provably non-optimal; shows near-equivalence between Hedge and Online Mirror Descent with the dilated entropy regularizer; applies these insights to DAGs and multitask learning.

Result: A lower bound of Omega(sqrt(T log|X|)/log d) for any algorithm, implying Hedge is near-optimal up to a sqrt(log d) factor; for m-sets with log d <= m <= sqrt(d), Hedge’s regret is suboptimal by a factor sqrt(log d); Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning; OMD with the dilated entropy regularizer is iterate-equivalent to Hedge and achieves similar guarantees for DAG shortest-path problems.

Conclusion: Hedge is near-optimal in a broad class of combinatorial settings but not universally optimal; certain families admit a provable gap of order sqrt(log d). In multitask learning Hedge is optimal; for DAGs, a regularizer-based approach via OMD recovers Hedge-like guarantees, offering a unified perspective across these domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

### [406] [Adapting to Stochastic and Adversarial Losses in Episodic MDPs with Aggregate Bandit Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17103)
*Shinji Ito,Kevin Jamieson,Haipeng Luo,Arnab Maiti,Taira Tsuchiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms for episodic tabular MDPs under aggregate bandit feedback; achieve O(log T) stochastic and O(√T) adversarial regret for known transitions, with matching lower bounds; extended to unknown transitions; uses FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators; also gives gap-dependent lower bounds and near-optimal BOBW for shortest-path with bandit feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for algorithms that perform well in both stochastic and adversarial environments under aggregate feedback in episodic MDPs, closing the gap between stochastic guarantees and adversarial robustness in this feedback model.

Method: Develops best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate feedback using Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) over occupancy measures, self-bounding analysis, and novel loss estimators inspired by online shortest path; handles known-transition and unknown-transition settings (the latter with confidence-based techniques).

Result: For known transitions: O(log T) regret in stochastic settings; O(√T) regret in adversarial settings; matching lower bounds. Extensions to unknown transitions with confidence-based methods. Additional contributions include first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and near-optimal BOBW results for shortest-path problems with bandit feedback.

Conclusion: The work establishes the first BOBW framework for episodic MDPs under aggregate bandit feedback, proving optimality (up to constants) and broadening applicability to unknown dynamics and related problems like shortest paths.

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

### [407] [Fighter: Unveiling the Graph Convolutional Nature of Transformers in Time Series Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17106)
*Chen Zhang,Weixin Bu,Wendong Xu,Runsheng Yu,Yik-Chung Wu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes Transformer encoder as a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN); introduces Fighter, a streamlined, interpretable time-series model using dynamic attention-based graphs and multi-hop aggregation to improve interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are powerful but opaque for time-series. A unified graph-based view can explain temporal dependencies and yield a more interpretable, efficient architecture for forecasting.

Method: Theoretically shows that the Transformer encoder forward pass corresponds to graph convolution with the attention matrix as a dynamic adjacency; backward pass updates mirror GCN parameter dynamics. Proposes Fighter, which eliminates redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation to represent temporal dependencies as explicit graph edges.

Result: Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks show competitive performance and enhanced interpretability of the learned temporal relations.

Conclusion: A unified GCN-based interpretation clarifies Transformer mechanics; Fighter offers a simpler, more interpretable architecture that maintains competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

### [408] [Matricial Free Energy as a Gaussianizing Regularizer: Enhancing Autoencoders for Gaussian Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17120)
*Rishi Sonthalia,Raj Rao Nadakuditi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes matricial free energy regularization for autoencoders, shaping the code matrix’s singular-value spectrum toward a Gaussian-like distribution to improve generalization and enable Gaussian-code autoencoders for underdetermined inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage free probability and random matrix theory to regularize latent codes so their singular-value distribution matches that of a Gaussian random metric, aiming for better generalization and tractable handling of inverse problems.

Method: Define a differentiable loss based on the singular values of the code matrix (code_dim x batch_size). Minimize the negative matricial free energy via standard SGD; theoretical minimum occurs when the singular-value distribution matches an i.i.d. Gaussian metric. Propose a complementary matricidal free energy maximizing autoencoder.

Result: Empirical simulations show that minimizing negative matricial free energy yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test sets. The maximizing variant reliably produces Gaussian codes and is applicable to underdetermined inverse problems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled path to produce Gaussian-like latent codes in autoencoders, with potential benefits for generalization and solving underdetermined inverse problems; suggests further exploration across datasets and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

### [409] [Continuous Q-Score Matching: Diffusion Guided Reinforcement Learning for Continuous-Time Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17122)
*Chengxiu Hua,Jiawen Gu,Yushun Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM) for continuous-time RL, using martingale-based Q-functions and diffusion-score gradients to drive policy improvement without time discretization; includes LQ theory and competitive simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time control with stochastic dynamics needs a principled way to evaluate actions without discretizing time, preserving action-evaluation capability of Q-functions while enabling DP in continuous time.

Method: Characterize continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition; link diffusion policy scores to the gradient of the learned Q-function through dynamic programming; introduce CQSM as a score-based policy improvement algorithm; provide theoretical closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) problems within this framework.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in simulated environments, compares favorably to baselines, and provides theoretical closed-form results for LQ control within the framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous-time RL with preserved Q-function evaluation without time discretization, offering both theoretical insights and practical policy improvement, supported by simulations and LQ results.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success across a wide
range of domains, however, most existing methods are formulated in discrete
time. In this work, we introduce a novel RL method for continuous-time control,
where stochastic differential equations govern state-action dynamics. Departing
from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

### [410] [Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17132)
*Ioannis Tsaknakis,Bingqing Song,Shuyu Gan,Dongyeop Kang,Alfredo Garcia,Gaowen Liu,Charles Fleming,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tri-agent, multi-task benchmark for latent information discovery in LLMs, showing variable success (32%–98%) in eliciting hidden user attributes across tasks, highlighting the challenge of truly adaptive personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often have latent preferences not explicitly stated; there is a need for a systematic benchmark to evaluate how well LLMs can uncover and reason about such latent information through dialogue.

Method: Introduce a tri-agent (User, Assistant, Judge) framework and evaluate across three progressively realistic settings: 20 Questions, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization, enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation.

Result: LLMs can surface latent information via dialogue, but performance varies dramatically by task and context, ranging from 32% to 98%, indicating context sensitivity and an open frontier for reliable latent preference inference.

Conclusion: This benchmark is the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interactions, showing that effective latent preference inference remains challenging and motivating further research toward truly adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

### [411] [In-situ Autoguidance: Eliciting Self-Correction in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17136)
*Enhao Gu,Haolin Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR:  Zero-cost self-guidance for diffusion models via in-situ autoguidance. The method uses a stochastic forward pass to produce an inferior prediction on-the-fly, reframing guidance as inference-time self-correction, eliminating the need for an auxiliary model and enabling cost-efficient alignment, quality, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between image quality/alignment and variation in classifier-free guidance (CFG) by removing reliance on an auxiliary, externally trained model while maintaining performance; reduce computational overhead.

Method: During inference, generate an inferior prediction on the fly by a stochastic forward pass and treat guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction, enabling zero-cost autoguidance with no extra components beyond the base diffusion model.

Result: The approach is viable and establishes a strong new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, showing that self-guidance benefits can be achieved without external auxiliary models.

Conclusion: Self-guidance in diffusion models can be achieved without external components through in-situ autoguidance, achieving quality/alignment and diversity without additional overhead.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

### [412] [Learning After Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17160)
*Derda Kaymak,Gyuhak Kim,Tomoya Kaichi,Tatsuya Konishi,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces PLDA for Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD): a framework enabling dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes after deployment, without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic/open environments, unseen classes can appear after deployment. Models should detect novel samples and learn them with minimal human intervention, expanding the set of ID classes over time.

Method: PLDA performs dynamic OOD detection to flag novel samples and incrementally learn new classes as they are labeled, avoiding retraining from scratch and addressing data scarcity.

Result: The authors claim empirical evaluations will demonstrate PLDA's effectiveness in enabling ALMD.

Conclusion: ALMD, via PLDA, provides a pathway for continuous, autonomous model updating post-deployment, tackling changing class distributions and scarce data.

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

### [413] [ALPINE: A Lightweight and Adaptive Privacy-Decision Agent Framework for Dynamic Edge Crowdsensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17162)
*Guanjie Cheng,Siyang Liu,Junqin Huang,Xinkui Zhao,Yin Wang,Mengying Zhu,Linghe Kong,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPINE is a lightweight, adaptive DP framework for mobile edge crowdsensing that autonomously tunes DP noise in real time using a TD3-based controller within a closed-loop risk-aware system, achieving a balance among privacy, data utility, and energy cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MECS systems are exposed to evolving privacy threats in dynamic, resource-constrained environments. Static differential privacy cannot adapt to changing adversarial capabilities and task constraints, leading to either excessive noise or insufficient protection.

Method: ALPINE consists of four modules: dynamic risk perception, privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), local privacy execution, and performance verification from edge nodes. It uses a risk-informed reward function to train a TD3 agent that tunes DP noise magnitude in response to environmental risk, balancing privacy gains, utility, and energy cost. A collaborative risk model and pretrained agent enable low-overhead deployment across devices.

Result: Theoretical analysis and real-world simulations show ALPINE mitigates inference attacks while preserving data utility and controlling energy cost, enabling practical deployment in large-scale edge applications.

Conclusion: ALPINE provides a practical, adaptive privacy control framework for MECS, enabling real-time DP tuning with low overhead and robust performance across diverse risk scenarios.

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

TL;DR: Unifies robustness evaluation for TAG learning across GNNs, RGNNs, and GraphLLMs; reveals text-structure robustness trade-offs; introduces SFT-auto for balanced robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAG robustness studies are fragmented; no comprehensive framework across model types and perturbation modes.

Method: Proposes unified evaluation framework across 10 datasets from 4 domains; tests classical GNNs, RGNNs, GraphLLMs under text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in poisoning and evasion; analyzes robustness trade-offs; introduces SFT-auto to improve robustness.

Result: Identifies three key findings: trade-offs between text and structure robustness; performance depends on text encoder and attack type; GraphLLMs vulnerable to training data corruption. SFT-auto achieves superior, balanced robustness. Code released.

Conclusion: Framework lays foundation for robust TAG learning in adversarial settings and provides practical solutions; enables systematic study of robustness across models.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work

### [415] [A Standardized Benchmark for Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics using Weighted Ensemble Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17187)
*Alexander Aghili,Andy Bruce,Daniel Sabo,Sanya Murdeshwar,Kevin Bachelor,Ionut Mistreanu,Ashwin Lokapally,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an open-source modular benchmarking framework for MD methods that uses Weighted Ensemble sampling (WESTPA) with TICA-based progress coordinates, plus a flexible propagator interface and a comprehensive 19+ metric evaluation suite, validated on a nine-protein dataset to enable reproducible, cross-method benchmarking of classical and ML-based MD approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MD method validation faces inconsistent metrics, insufficient sampling of rare conformations, and lack of standardized benchmarks. The work aims to provide a reproducible, extensible framework and dataset to enable fair, cross-method comparison across MD strategies (classical and ML-based).

Method: A modular framework using Weighted Ensemble (WESTPA) with TICA-derived progress coordinates to accelerate exploration of protein conformational space; a lightweight propagator interface supporting arbitrary engines; an evaluation suite with over 19 metrics/visualizations; a nine-protein dataset (10–224 residues) simulated at 300K for 1e6 MD steps per starting point (4 ns) to benchmark performance; demonstrations include classic MD with implicit solvent and comparisons between fully trained and under-trained CGSchNet models.

Result: Proposes an open-source benchmarking platform capable of standardizing evaluations across MD approaches, along with a curated protein dataset and a suite of diagnostics to quantify sampling quality and method performance; validations illustrate the framework’s utility in comparing ML-augmented and classical MD methods.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a standardized, reproducible benchmark ecosystem for MD methods, facilitating fair comparisons across engines and models and fostering community-wide adoption through open-source tooling and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

### [416] [SOLE: Hardware-Software Co-design of Softmax and LayerNorm for Efficient Transformer Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17189)
*Wenxun Wang,Shuchang Zhou,Wenyu Sun,Peiqin Sun,Yongpan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE: a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and LayerNorm in Transformers, using E2Softmax with log2 quantization and log-based division, and AILayerNorm with low-precision statistics. Achieves low-precision calculation and storage with no retraining, delivering substantial speedups and energy/area efficiency over GPUs and prior HW for Softmax/LayerNorm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax and LayerNorm bottlenecks in Transformer inference; previous function-approximation approaches focus on computation but incur memory overhead and require retraining to offset approximation errors. A hardware-friendly, retraining-free solution is needed for real-time inference efficiency.

Method: Introduce SOLE composed of E2Softmax (log2-quantized exponent with log-based division) and AILayerNorm (low-precision statistic computation) as a hardware-software co-design. The design emphasizes low-precision calculation and low-bit-width storage for Softmax and LayerNorm, avoiding retraining.

Result: SOLE maintains inference accuracy without retraining and achieves significant improvements: 3.04x and 3.86x energy-efficiency improvements, and 2.82x and 3.32x area-efficiency improvements over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm respectively, while offering orders of magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU.

Conclusion: A practical co-design that enables accurate Transformer inference with low-precision Softmax and LayerNorm, delivering substantial hardware efficiency gains without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

### [417] [Soft-Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17206)
*Michael Hersche,Samuel Moor-Smith,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft-masking (SM) for diffusion-based LMs blends mask embeddings with top-k predictions to provide richer priors, improving perplexity, MAUVE, and coding benchmarks; validated via continued pretraining and finetuning Dream models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The binary retain-or-replace step in masked diffusion discards valuable predictive information. SM preserves partial information by blending the mask with embeddings of top-k predictions, enabling context propagation across steps and potentially faster/high-throughput generation.

Method: Introduce soft-masking (SM) that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-k predicted tokens for each retained mask. Adapt a pretrained masked diffusion LM to incorporate SM. Continue pretraining a 169M-parameter model with SM, then finetune Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B with SM.

Result: SM yields improved perplexity and MAUVE on a 169M-parameter model. When finetuning Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, SM consistently improves performance on multiple coding benchmarks, especially in high-throughput settings.

Conclusion: Soft-masking is an effective enhancement for masked diffusion LMs, providing richer priors and enabling better generation quality and efficiency. It is applicable to existing diffusion models and shows promise for coding tasks at scale.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

### [418] [D2C-HRHR: Discrete Actions with Double Distributional Critics for High-Risk-High-Return Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17212)
*Jundong Zhang,Yuhui Situ,Fanji Zhang,Rongji Deng,Tianqi Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a multimodal-risk-aware RL framework for HRHR tasks by discretizing actions, adding entropy-based exploration, and using dual critics; achieves superior performance on locomotion/manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRHR tasks exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns; Gaussian policies with scalar critics fail to guarantee convergence to optimal policies; explicit multimodality and risk modeling is needed.

Method: 1) discretize continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions; 2) employ entropy-regularized exploration to cover risky but rewarding actions; 3) introduce a dual-critic architecture for improved discrete action-value estimation; framework scales to high-dimensional actions.

Result: Empirical results on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high failure risk show the proposed method outperforms baselines, indicating benefits of multimodality and risk modeling.

Conclusion: Explicit multimodality and risk modeling improves RL in HRHR tasks; the proposed discretization, exploration, and dual-critic framework is effective and scalable.

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

### [419] [Diagnosis of Fuel Cell Health Status with Deep Sparse Auto-Encoder Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17214)
*Chenyan Fei,Dalin Zhang,Chen Melinda Dang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep sparse auto-encoder network is proposed to predict and classify high-frequency impedance for fuel cell health, achieving >92% accuracy, and deployed on FPGA with ~90% hardware recognition rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online, accurate, and cost-effective diagnosis of fuel cell health is challenging; high-frequency impedance is a key diagnostic parameter but real-time testing is complex and expensive.

Method: Train/apply a deep sparse auto-encoding network to predict and classify high-frequency impedance data; include information processing for both prediction and classification; deploy the trained model on an FPGA for hardware-based recognition.

Result: Achieves accuracy greater than 92% in prediction/classification of HF impedance; FPGA deployment yields a hardware recognition rate of about 90%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective real-time health monitoring potential for fuel cells with a hardware-accelerated solution, balancing accuracy and implementation practicality, though real-world deployment would require validation across varying operating conditions.

Abstract: Effective and accurate diagnosis of fuel cell health status is crucial for
ensuring the stable operation of fuel cell stacks. Among various parameters,
high-frequency impedance serves as a critical indicator for assessing fuel cell
state and health conditions. However, its online testing is prohibitively
complex and costly. This paper employs a deep sparse auto-encoding network for
the prediction and classification of high-frequency impedance in fuel cells,
achieving metric of accuracy rate above 92\%. The network is further deployed
on an FPGA, attaining a hardware-based recognition rate almost 90\%.

### [420] [A Prototypical Network with an Attention-based Encoder for Drivers Identification Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17250)
*Wei-Hsun Lee,Che-Yu Chang,Kuang-Yu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AttEnc and P-AttEnc for driver identification, using an attention-based encoder and a prototypical network to enable few-shot learning, achieving very high accuracy on known datasets with far fewer parameters and faster inference, while enabling recognition of unknown drivers in one-shot/few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric-based driver identification raises privacy concerns and data shortage hinders model performance, especially for unknown drivers; the work aims to reduce model size, improve generalization, and enable learning from scarce data.

Method: Develop an attention-based encoder (AttEnc) with fewer parameters; combine it with a prototypical network to create P-AttEnc for few-shot learning; evaluate on three datasets; measure accuracy, prediction time, and parameter reduction; include one-shot and unknown-driver experiments and concept of driver fingerprints.

Result: AttEnc achieves 99.3%, 99.0%, and 99.9% accuracy on three datasets with 44%-79% faster prediction and ~87.6% fewer parameters. P-AttEnc yields 69.8% accuracy in one-shot driver identification and 65.7% average accuracy for classifying unknown drivers in a one-shot setting.

Conclusion: The AttEnc and P-AttEnc architectures offer strong performance with significantly smaller models and enhanced generalization in data-scarce scenarios; P-AttEnc extends to recognizing unknown drivers under few-shot conditions, although one-shot unknown-driver accuracy indicates room for further improvement.

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

### [421] [Adaptive Discretization for Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17266)
*Jiayu Bai,Zhanbo Feng,Zhijie Deng,Tianqi Hou,Robert C. Qiu,Zenan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified adaptive discretization framework for Consistency Models (ADCM) that optimizes discretization step via a local-consistency objective with a global-consistency constraint, solved by Gauss-Newton; yields efficient training and strong generative performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with adaptable DM variants; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMs currently rely on hand-designed discretization schemes that require repeated tuning across noise schedules and datasets; automatic/adaptive discretization can improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Formulate discretization as optimization over the step size using a Lagrangian combining a local consistency objective (trainability) and a global consistency constraint (denoising error). Introduce a Lagrange multiplier to balance them; solve with Gauss-Newton to obtain adaptive discretization; integrate into consistency training; demonstrates generalization to DM variants.

Result: Empirical results show ADCMs improve training efficiency and achieve superior generative performance with minimal overhead on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet; show adaptability to advanced DM variants; code provided.

Conclusion: ADCM provides automatic, adaptive discretization for CMs, reducing manual tuning, enabling robust and efficient one-step generation across datasets and DM variants.

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

### [422] [Uncertainty-aware data assimilation through variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17268)
*Anthony Frion,David S Greenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A variational-inference extension yields probabilistic (Gaussian) data assimilation, achieving near-perfect calibration on Lorenz-96 and scalable gains with longer assimilation windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data assimilation under uncertainty and the need for calibrated probabilistic forecasts; extends a deterministic ML-based DA approach into a probabilistic framework.

Method: Model the predicted state as a multivariate Gaussian within a variational inference scheme, building on an existing deterministic ML DA method; validate on chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics; enable integration into a broader variational DA pipeline.

Result: Near-perfect calibration of predictions on Lorenz-96; the approach benefits from longer data assimilation windows and can be integrated into larger VA pipelines; code available.

Conclusion: Introducing Gaussian-approximate state distributions via variational inference improves calibration and extendability of data assimilation frameworks.

Abstract: Data assimilation, consisting in the combination of a dynamical model with a
set of noisy and incomplete observations in order to infer the state of a
system over time, involves uncertainty in most settings. Building upon an
existing deterministic machine learning approach, we propose a variational
inference-based extension in which the predicted state follows a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Using the chaotic Lorenz-96 dynamics as a testing
ground, we show that our new model enables to obtain nearly perfectly
calibrated predictions, and can be integrated in a wider variational data
assimilation pipeline in order to achieve greater benefit from increasing
lengths of data assimilation windows. Our code is available at

### [423] [Breaking and Fixing Defenses Against Control-Flow Hijacking in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17276)
*Rishi Jha,Harold Triedman,Justin Wagle,Vitaly Shmatikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attacks show that alignment-based defenses for multi-agent systems can be bypassed; the paper then presents ControlValve, a CFG- and context-based enforcement mechanism to restrict agent control flows and improve safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in multi-agent systems conflicts with functionality. Alignment checks are brittle and context-insensitive, allowing control-flow hijacking even against sophisticated defenses. A stronger, principled defense is needed.

Method: 1) Demonstrate control-flow hijacking attacks that evade alignment-based defenses (even with advanced LLMs); 2) Argue the safety-functionality conflict and brittle alignment definitions; 3) Propose and implement ControlValve that (a) generates permitted control-flow graphs (CFGs) for the system and (b) enforces execution against these CFGs plus contextual rules (zero-shot) for each agent invocation, to enforce least privilege.

Result: Demonstrations show that existing alignment checks can be bypassed by hijacking attempts, even under LLM-enabled defenses. ControlValve is implemented and evaluated, producing allowable CFGs and enforcing policy with contextual rules, thereby improving protection against unsafe invocations.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental tension between safety and functionality in multi-agent systems, exacerbated by brittle alignment notions and incomplete execution context visibility. ControlValve offers a practical defense by combining control-flow integrity with least privilege, constraining agent behavior to approved graphs and context-driven rules.

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

*Qingyao Ai,Yichen Tang,Changyue Wang,Jianming Long,Weihang Su,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A user-feedback-driven continual learning benchmark for LLMs, introducing a simulation framework and cross-domain benchmark to evaluate memory and continual learning from real-time feedback; current baselines underperform on this setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling LLMs yields diminishing returns; learning from practice via memory and continual learning is a key research direction. Existing memory benchmarks focus on homogeneous tasks and long inputs, not on learning from accumulated user feedback during service.

Method: Propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple domains, languages, and task types to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLM systems.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying in both effectiveness and efficiency for continual learning with user feedback, indicating large room for improvement.

Conclusion: The benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms, enabling better learning from user feedback and practice-based knowledge accumulation.

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

### [425] [Symmetries in PAC-Bayesian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17303)
*Armin Beck,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends PAC-Bayes generalization bounds to non-compact symmetries and non-invariant data, with empirical validation on rotated MNIST showing improved guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetries help ML generalization, but existing theory focuses on compact groups and invariant data; real-world data often violate these assumptions.

Method: Adapt and tighten PAC-Bayes bounds (notably McAllester's) to non-compact symmetries and non-invariant distributions; demonstrate applicability to a wide range of PAC-Bayes bounds; provide theoretical derivations and empirical validation on a rotated MNIST dataset with non-uniform rotations.

Result: Derived generalization guarantees hold in the broader setting and improve upon prior bounds; experiments corroborate theory, showing better-than-baseline guarantees on rotated MNIST with non-uniform rotations.

Conclusion: Symmetric models offer generalization benefits beyond compact/invariant settings, suggesting a broader, more general role for symmetry in ML theory and practice.

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

*Tal Barami,Nimrod Berman,Ilan Naiman,Amos H. Hason,Rotem Ezra,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmark and toolkit for multi-factor sequential disentanglement across video, audio, and time series, featuring a post-hoc latent alignment stage, a Koopman-inspired model with state-of-the-art results, and Vision-Language Model-based automated annotation and zero-shot evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data exhibits multiple interacting semantic factors over time. Prior work largely covers two-factor, static/dynamic settings and lacks standardized benchmarks, scalable tooling, and automated annotation/evaluation for multi-factor disentanglement.

Method: Develop a standardized, modular benchmark across six diverse datasets (video, audio, time series) for multi-factor sequential disentanglement; introduce a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to align latent dimensions with semantic factors; propose a Koopman-inspired model achieving state-of-the-art performance; leverage Vision-Language Models to automate dataset annotation and provide zero-shot disentanglement evaluation.

Result: The Koopman-inspired model attains state-of-the-art results on the benchmark; Vision-Language Models enable automated dataset annotation and zero-shot evaluation of disentanglement; the framework provides a scalable foundation for multi-factor sequential disentanglement research.

Conclusion: The authors offer a robust, scalable platform with modular tooling, automated annotation, and effective evaluation to advance multi-factor sequential disentanglement across diverse data modalities.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

*Lipeng Xie,Sen Huang,Zhuo Zhang,Anni Zou,Yunpeng Zhai,Dingchao Ren,Kezun Zhang,Haoyuan Hu,Boyin Liu,Haoran Chen,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient, training-free reward-modeling framework that infers high-quality, query-specific rubrics via a Propose-Evaluate-Revise process and compresses them into a core Theme-Tips rubric set using an information-theoretic coding rate, enabling small models with few preferences to outperform larger, fully-trained baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: _Address costly preference data and limited interpretability in reward models_ by introducing a transparent, generalizable rubric-based approach that scales and remains reliable.

Method: Two-stage process: (1) Propose-Evaluate-Revise to infer high-quality, query-specific rubrics guided by a validation set; (2) compress these rubrics into a non-redundant core set by maximizing information-theoretic coding rate, yielding a hierarchical Theme-Tips rubric set. Training-free.

Result: Empirical evidence of high data efficiency and performance; with only 70 preference pairs (about 1.5% of the source data), a smaller model (Qwen3-8B) can outperform specialized, fully-trained counterparts.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, interpretable, and data-efficient reward-modeling framework. The rubrics generalize across diverse queries, enabling efficient alignment of LLMs with human values and offering a practical, rubric-based approach with strong empirical gains.

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

Motivation: To reconcile interpretability and performance in LLMs by enabling dynamic, multi-granular capacity allocation without frequent retraining, and by extending this adaptability across specialized models for regulated domains.

Method: Introduce a locality dial that controls localization during training and inference without retraining; employ an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism to allocate semantic blocks adaptively; implement hierarchical recruitment across entire LLM ecosystems. Techniques include group sparsity penalties on attention, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and penalized likelihood-based recruitment with explicit units; provide mathematical analysis with threshold conditions, entropy and pointer fidelity bounds, and convergence guarantees at block and LLM levels.

Result: Rigorous theoretical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points; exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity; convergence guarantees for both fine-grained block-level and coarse-grained LLM-level recruitment, demonstrating discovery of semantic partitions balancing model complexity and data encoding efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes while enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation across specialized LLMs, suitable for regulated domains requiring transparency and capability.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

### [429] [Model Metamers Reveal Invariances in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17378)
*Wei Xu,Xiaoyi Jiang,Lixiang Xu,Dechao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses metamers to probe invariance in Graph Neural Networks, revealing excessive, human-invariant-like properties in current GNNs and proposing metamers as a diagnostic benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and human perception; understanding and measuring invariance in GNNs is essential for robust, human-aligned representations.

Method: Generate metamers by optimizing input graphs to produce identical internal activations to a reference graph; analyze local metamer dimension and activation-induced volume changes; evaluate across classic GNN architectures; assess how architectural changes and training strategies affect invariance; quantify how metamers differ from original graphs.

Result: Found extreme levels of representational invariance across several standard GNN architectures; targeted architectural/training modifications can partially reduce invariance but cannot bridge the gap to human-like invariance; metamers reveal unique failure modes and provide a complementary benchmark for evaluating GNNs.

Conclusion: Current GNNs exhibit fundamental gaps in human-like invariance. Metamer-based analysis is a valuable diagnostic tool and benchmark for guiding future model development toward more human-aligned invariances.

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

### [430] [Optimizing Energy Management of Smart Grid using Reinforcement Learning aided by Surrogate models built using Physics-informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17380)
*Julen Cestero,Carmine Delle Femine,Kenji S. Muro,Marco Quartulli,Marcello Restelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINN-based surrogate models replace costly smart-grid simulators to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) for Optimal Power Flow, achieving faster convergence with lower sample costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for Optimal Power Flow in smart grids suffers from severe sample inefficiency because high-fidelity simulators are expensive to run; reducing dependence on those simulators can drastically speed up learning.

Method: Develop Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as surrogate models of the grid simulator and integrate them into the RL training loop to approximate environment dynamics and rewards.

Result: RL policy training converges in a fraction of the time required by the original environment, with substantially lower simulation cost while preserving policy quality.

Conclusion: PINN-based surrogates are effective for improving sample efficiency in RL for smart-grid OPF tasks and can enable faster, more cost-efficient policy learning; potential for broader applicability in energy systems.

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

### [431] [Beyond Binary Out-of-Distribution Detection: Characterizing Distributional Shifts with Multi-Statistic Diffusion Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17381)
*Achref Jaziri,Martin Rogmann,Martin Mundt,Visvanathan Ramesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization (DISC) introduces a multi-dimensional OOD representation that uses diffusion denoising across noise levels to detect and classify OOD types, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection relies on single scalar outlier scores, which blur distributional shifts and fail to distinguish OOD types. There is a need for richer representations that can contextualize and guide actions for different OOD scenarios.

Method: Leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a multi-dimensional feature vector across multiple noise levels, capturing statistical discrepancies. This vector is used for both OOD detection and classification of OOD type.

Result: On image and tabular benchmarks, DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and, crucially, can classify the OOD type, a capability largely absent from prior work.

Conclusion: Moves OOD research from binary detection to granular, type-aware detection, enabling more informed and appropriate responses to different OOD data.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

### [432] [Latent Spaces Beyond Synthesis: From GANs to Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17383)
*Ludovica Schaerf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based generative models distribute representation across layers, undermining a single latent-space synthesis and supporting a view of synthesis as emergent, specialized processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rethink internal representations in generative AI and the metaphors that accompany them (e.g., latent space, Platonic representation). The paper interrogates the shift from GANs/VAEs to diffusion architectures and aims to reframe what 'synthesis' means in modern generative systems.

Method: Close readings of model architectures and a targeted layerwise intervention experimental setup to perturb and examine representations across layers, contrasting diffusion models with older paradigms like GANs/VAEs.

Result: Diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and challenge the assumption of a unified internal space, suggesting that internal processing is distributed across layers rather than concentrated in a compact latent variable.

Conclusion: Proposes a theoretical shift: generative AI should be understood as an emergent configuration of specialized processes rather than direct synthesis of content, with careful reevaluation of metaphors such as latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis.

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

### [433] [TabR1: Taming GRPO for tabular reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17385)
*Pengxiang Cai,Zihao Gao,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabR1 is a reasoning LLM for tabular prediction that uses permutation-relative policy optimization (PRPO) to enable multi-step reasoning, yielding strong zero-shot/few-shot performance and interpretability, and competitive results with full supervision; notably, an 8B model can outperform much larger LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular prediction typically relies on gradient-boosted trees or specialized models that lack interpretability and transferability. LLMs offer cross-task adaptability with transparent reasoning traces, but their potential for tabular data remains underexplored. There is a need for methods that inject structural priors and enable efficient learning with limited supervision.

Method: The approach uses TabR1, a reasoning LLM for tabular data. At its core is PRPO (Permutation Relative Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. For each sample, multiple label-preserving column permutations are constructed; advantages are estimated within and across these permutations to convert sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improve generalization.

Result: Under full supervision, TabR1 matches strong baselines when fine-tuned. In zero-shot settings, it nears 32-shot performance. An 8B TabR1 model substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B). It also enhances interpretability and few-shot/zero-shot capabilities.

Conclusion: PRPO enables multi-step reasoning for tabular data with LLMs, making them competitive with traditional methods under supervision and particularly strong in low-supervision regimes, while offering better interpretability and transferability.

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

### [434] [Exploration via Feature Perturbation in Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17390)
*Seouh-won Yi,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature perturbation injects randomness into inputs rather than parameters or rewards, achieving near-optimal regret O(d sqrt T) for generalized linear bandits with efficient computation and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exploration in bandit learning by avoiding costly parameter sampling and reward perturbations while maintaining strong regret guarantees and scalability to non-parametric models.

Method: Perturb the feature vectors fed into the decision process (feature perturbation), injecting randomness directly into inputs instead of randomizing parameters or rewards; avoids parameter sampling and is computationally efficient.

Result: Attains tilde O(d sqrt T) worst-case regret for generalized linear bandits, beating the typical tilde O(d^{3/2} sqrt T) of randomized bandit methods; extends to non-parametric or neural network models; empirically demonstrates superior performance and strong theory-practice alignment.

Conclusion: Feature perturbation offers a simple, scalable, and effective mechanism that unifies practical performance with solid theoretical guarantees and broad applicability across model families.

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

### [435] [Finite-Time Bounds for Average-Reward Fitted Q-Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17391)
*Jongmin Lee,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Anchored FQI provides finite-time sample complexity guarantees for average-reward offline RL in weakly communicating MDPs, including single-trajectory data, by using an anchor (weight-decay) mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is substantial work on discounted offline RL, but average-reward offline RL with function approximation lacks finite-time guarantees under mild assumptions. Existing results rely on restrictive ergodicity or linearity; this work aims to relax those to weakly communicating MDPs.

Method: Introduce Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, combining standard FQI with an anchor mechanism that acts like weight decay. Proves finite-time sample complexity results for average-reward offline RL under weakly communicating MDPs and extends the analysis to datasets generated from a single trajectory.

Result: Demonstrates that the anchor is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the average-reward setting and provides finite-time sample complexity guarantees. Extends the results to non-IID data (single-trajectory datasets).

Conclusion: Anchored FQI enables practical finite-time analysis for average-reward offline RL under milder weakly communicating MDP assumptions, and the anchor mechanism is essential for achieving these guarantees, even when data come from a single trajectory.

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

### [436] [MILES: Modality-Informed Learning Rate Scheduler for Balancing Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17394)
*Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares,Farah E. Shamout*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MILES introduces a dynamic learning-rate scheduler that balances modality contributions during training, addressing modality overfitting to improve both multimodal and unimodal performance across multiple tasks and fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modality overfitting hinders multimodal networks from leveraging all available data sources; current approaches often let a single modality dominate, limiting gains from multimodal fusion and harming unimodal performance. A balanced training signal across modalities is needed to learn robust, complementary representations.

Method: The Modality-Informed Learning rate Scheduler (MILES) dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each modality based on modality-wise conditional utilization during training, balancing the speed at which the model learns from each modality in joint fusion models. It is evaluated on four multimodal joint fusion tasks and compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines, across various fusion methods.

Result: MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion methods studied, effectively balancing modality usage during training, improving overall multimodal performance, and producing stronger modality encoders that also benefit unimodal predictions or when modalities are absent.

Conclusion: Balancing multimodal learning through a modality-informed LR scheduler mitigates modality overfitting and yields gains in both multimodal and unimodal performance, underscoring the importance of balanced training signals in multimodal networks.

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

*Keivan Faghih Niresi,Zepeng Zhang,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RINS-T is a pretraining-free deep-prior framework for robust time-series linear inverse problems that uses implicit neural priors and robust optimization, augmented by three tricks for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data are often corrupted by missing values, noise, and outliers, which hinder forecasting and anomaly detection; existing deep methods require extensive pretraining and may fail under distribution shifts, prompting a pretraining-free robust solution.

Method: RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors integrated with robust optimization. It introduces guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination to improve optimization stability and robustness, without requiring pretraining data.

Result: The approach yields high recovery performance and robustness to outliers, while relaxing Gaussian noise assumptions.

Conclusion: RINS-T provides a flexible and effective solution for real-world time-series inverse problems without relying on pretraining, and its code is publicly available.

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

*Tiezhi Wang,Wilhelm Haverkamp,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S4ECG uses structured state-space models to fuse multi-epoch ECG data for arrhythmia classification, achieving temporally-aware detection with improved performance and robustness compared to single-epoch methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG signals are time-series with global physiology and local waveform dynamics. Existing methods struggle to capture their simultaneous global-local interplay at high temporal resolution, hindering robust detection of complex arrhythmias and limiting out-of-distribution generalization.

Method: Introduce S4ECG, a deep learning architecture that leverages structured state space models to enable multi-epoch predictions for ECG arrhythmia classification.

Result: Compared with single-epoch approaches, multi-epoch predictions improve macro-AUROC by 1.0–11.6%. Atrial fibrillation specificity rises from 0.718–0.979 to 0.967–0.998, with improved in-distribution and out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic analysis identifies optimal temporal dependency windows of 10–20 minutes for peak performance.

Conclusion: The work advances temporally-aware arrhythmia detection, signaling a paradigm shift in ECG interpretation and enhancing detection of complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and flutter, especially under distribution shifts.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

*Hequn Li,Zhongwei Deng,Chunlin Jiang,Yvxin He andZhansheng Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based time-series model (CDUA) with attention outperforms baselines in predicting lithium-ion battery capacity and quantifying uncertainty, using engineered features from real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate capacity prediction with quantified uncertainty is critical for reliable battery management under aging stochasticity.

Method: Feature engineering via Pearson correlation and XGBoost to select relevant features; CDUA comprises a contextual U-Net with self-attention for temporal dependencies and a denoising network; diffusion-based generative model for forecasting.

Result: On real-world vehicle data: relative MAE 0.94%, relative RMSE 1.14%, 95% CI width 3.74%; robust and superior to mainstream methods.

Conclusion: CDUA delivers accurate capacity estimates with reliable uncertainty quantification, suitable for robust battery management.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

### [440] [Diffusion Models as Dataset Distillation Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17421)
*Duo Su,Huyu Wu,Huanran Chen,Yiming Shi,Yuzhu Wang,Xi Ye,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion As Priors (DAP) guides diffusion-based dataset distillation with a Mercer-kernel similarity prior to enhance representativeness, achieving training-free improvement and better cross-architecture generalization on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dataset distillation, achieving diversity, generalization, and representativeness is challenging; diffusion-based methods lack a principled representativeness prior and often require external constraints.

Method: Define representativeness as similarity in feature space via a Mercer kernel between synthetic and real data; incorporate this as guidance to steer reverse diffusion without retraining.

Result: DAP yields higher fidelity distilled datasets and better cross-architecture generalization on ImageNet-1K and subsets compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: This work links diffusion priors with dataset distillation objectives and offers a practical, training-free framework to improve distilled data quality.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

*Li Sun,Zhenhao Huang,Ming Zhang,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Local geometry-informed GBN mitigates oversmoothing/oversquashing in MPNNs via local bottleneck and Robin-type boundary conditions, enabling very deep networks with strong expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global spectral-gap analysis shows that increasing the spectral gap lambda leads to gradient vanishing with respect to input features, undermining effective message passing; this motivates a local, structures-aware approach to preserve expressiveness across the graph.

Method: Propose GBN (Graph Bottleneck Network) with local bottleneck adjustment; derive a nonhomogeneous boundary condition inspired by Robin boundary conditions to address oversquashing and oversmoothing; connect local Riemannian geometry to MPNNs and provide theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs demonstrates improved expressiveness and robustness; GBN remains effective even when network depth exceeds 256 layers.

Conclusion: Local, geometry-guided design outperforms global approaches in addressing oversmoothing/oversquashing, offering theoretical guarantees and scalability for very deep MPNNs.

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for microseismic detection are accurate but opaque. Applying explainable AI can improve trust, reliability, and robustness in critical seismic monitoring.

Method: Apply Grad-CAM to reveal where PhaseNet attends, showing alignment with P- and S-wave arrivals. Use SHAP to quantify feature contributions, finding vertical components drive P-picks and horizontal components drive S-picks. Develop SHAP-gated inference that fuses model output with explanation-based metrics to reject unlikely detections.

Result: On 9,000 waveforms, SHAP-gated model achieves F1=0.98 (precision=0.99, recall=0.97), surpassing PhaseNet baseline F1=0.97 and showing increased robustness to noise.

Conclusion: XAI can both interpret and improve deep seismic detectors, offering a path toward more trustworthy automated detection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

*Dan Zheng,Jing Feng,Juan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cross-state ECG biometric authentication model (CrossStateECG) is proposed to address rest-exercise variability in ECG-based identification, achieving high cross-state accuracy and good generalization across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resting-state ECG biometrics struggle when applied to post-exercise or cross-state scenarios. A robust cross-state solution is needed for real-world authentication where physiological states vary.

Method: A model combining multi-scale deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to extract robust, state-invariant representations, evaluated under cross-state train/test splits (Rest->Exercise, Exercise->Rest) and Mixed scenarios, with further generalization tests on ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets.

Result: On Exercise-ECGID dataset: Rest-to-Exercise 92.50% accuracy; Exercise-to-Rest 94.72%. Rest-to-Rest 99.94%; Mixed-to-Mixed 97.85%. Additional validations on ECG-ID and MIT-BIH show good generalization.

Conclusion: CrossStateECG effectively addresses cross-state (rest vs. post-exercise) ECG biometrics, showing strong cross-state robustness and generalization, indicating practical viability for dynamic real-world authentication.

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic
real-world settings.

### [444] [Layer Specialization Underlying Compositional Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17469)
*Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers develop modular, hierarchically organized representations that support compositional reasoning, with performance scaling with task complexity and in-context example count; out-of-distribution generalization requires more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models achieve compositional reasoning and in-context learning-like capabilities by examining internal representations and training dynamics on a document-generated hierarchical rule task.

Method: Use the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences via recursive rule application. Train transformers on subsets of sequences and evaluate under four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and cross-layer transfer. Analyze layer specialization over training and apply principal component analysis and attention pattern clustering to reveal hierarchical representations in specialized layers.

Result: Performance improves with task complexity and number of in-context examples; OOD generalization tasks require substantially more examples than in-distribution tasks. A progressive emergence of layer specialization correlates with generalization performance. PCA and attention clustering show transformers develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers.

Conclusion: Transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms that support compositional reasoning; linking internal algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities, and clarifying how in-context learning-like behavior arises from emergent, layer-wise specialization.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

### [445] [DAMSDAN: Distribution-Aware Multi-Source Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain EEG-based Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17475)
*Fo Hu,Can Wang,Qinxu Zheng,Xusheng Yang,Bin Zhou,Gang Li,Yu Sun,Wen-an Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN) for cross-domain EEG emotion recognition, combining prototype-based constraints, adversarial learning, MMD-based source weighting, and prototype-guided conditional alignment to improve cross-subject/session generalization, achieving strong results on SEED, SEED-IV, and FACED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Significant inter-individual variability in EEG hampers generalization in cross-domain emotion recognition. Two main challenges: heterogeneity across multiple sources and semantic drift that reduces class discrimination; need dynamic source weighting and fine-grained alignment.

Method: DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to yield discriminative, domain-invariant representations. It uses a domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to dynamically reweight sources. It also includes a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction to improve pseudo-label reliability and enable category-level alignment.

Result: On SEED and SEED-IV: cross-subject accuracies 94.86% / 79.78%; cross-session 95.12% / 83.15%. On FACED: 82.88% cross-subject. Ablations and interpretability analyses confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: DAMSDAN effectively handles distributional heterogeneity and semantic drift in cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition, achieving strong performance and robustness across datasets.

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

### [446] [Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 2: inversion of fluvial deposits and latent-space disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17478)
*Guillaume Rongier,Luk Peeters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANs can be used in geomodeling and inverted to fit well/seismic data, but current latent-space entanglement limits inversion; partial disentanglement helps, while local fine-tuning improves matches; robustness and practice still need evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and uncertainties in subsurface decision-making demand embedding geological knowledge into predictive models. Process-based models that mimic geological processes can train generative models to enable efficient predictions and data assimilation.

Method: Train a GAN to generate fluvial deposits and attempt inversion to match well and seismic data. Apply four inversion approaches to three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells. Investigate latent-space entanglement; test label conditioning or latent overparameterization to partially disentangle the latent space; perform local fine-tuning of the GAN to restructure the latent space and reduce mismatches, with and without seismic data.

Result: Inversions struggled to match well data, especially as the number of wells increased or test data diverged from training data. The GAN latent representation was entangled, causing similar sedimentological features to be distant in latent space. Label conditioning or latent overparameterization partially helped but were not sufficient for successful inversion. Local fine-tuning of the GAN reduced mismatches to acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data, but the approach depends on an initial partial inversion step and influences final sample quality and diversity.

Conclusion: GANs are capable within geomodeling workflows, but more work is needed to assess robustness and determine best practices for leveraging them in geological interpretation.

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

### [447] [Unified Privacy Guarantees for Decentralized Learning via Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17480)
*Aurélien Bellet,Edwige Cyffers,Davide Frey,Romaric Gaudel,Dimitri Lerévérend,François Taïani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Matrix Factorization–based DP accounting for decentralized learning (DL) and presents MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with correlated user-level noise that yields tighter privacy guarantees and improved utility on graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-DL often underperforms centralized DP due to misaccounted temporal noise correlations and privacy–utility gaps; extending MF-based DP accounting to DL offers tighter privacy estimates and a unified framework for DL algorithms and trust models.

Method: Generalize centralized MF DP accounting to DL, casting standard DL algorithms and trust models into a unified MF framework; propose MAFALDA-SGD with user-level correlated noise in a gossip-based DL setting; analyze privacy accounting and develop algorithmic procedures.

Result: Tighter privacy accounting for DP-DL algorithms; MAFALDA-SGD outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs, demonstrating practical privacy–utility gains.

Conclusion: MF-based DP accounting is transferable to decentralized settings, enabling tighter guarantees and guiding new algorithm designs like correlated-noise gossip DL; the approach helps reconcile privacy with utility in DL.

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

*Athanasios Angelakis,Amne Mousa,Micah L. A. Heldeweg,Laurens A. Biesheuvel,Mark A. Haaksma,Jasper M. Smit,Pieter R. Tuinman,Paul W. G. Elbers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT is a 0.25M-parameter, permutation-invariant Vision Transformer for lung ultrasound video classification that uses ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation to handle unordered medical image data, achieving ROC-AUC ~0.80 and enabling faster, efficient deployment compared to baselines that fail on heterogeneous NCIP/ARDS-like patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating cardiogenic edema from non-cardiogenic and normal lungs in LUS is challenging due to high heterogeneity and artefacts. Conventional models struggle with overlapping B-lines and pleural artifacts; an architecture tailored to unordered, small medical datasets may yield better generalization than scaling large models.

Method: Introduce ZACH-ViT, a compact Vision Transformer without positional embeddings or CLS token, making it permutation-invariant. Propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA) that permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving anatomical validity. Evaluate on 380 LUS videos from 95 patients against nine baselines.

Result: ZACH-ViT achieves validation/test ROC-AUC of 0.80/0.79, with balanced sensitivity 0.60 and specificity 0.91. Competing models collapse to trivial classification due to data heterogeneity. Training is 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT, with 2.5x fewer parameters, demonstrating favorable efficiency and generalization for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: Architectural alignment with data structure can outperform mere scaling in small-data medical imaging tasks. ZACH-ViT’s permutation-invariant design and SSDA enable robust discrimination in heterogeneous LUS patterns and support real-time clinical use.

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

*Maxim Bolshim,Alexander Kugaevskikh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to analyze neural networks using layer-wise Hessians, linking local curvature to generalization and architecture; empirical results (111 experiments, 37 datasets) show spectral patterns relate to overfitting, underparameterization, and expressivity, suggesting a geometry-based framework for diagnosis and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the local optimization geometry (via layer-wise Hessians) relates to neural network behavior, generalization, and architecture, enabling diagnosis and principled design.

Method: Define the local Hessian per layer as the second-derivative matrix of a scalar loss with respect to that layer's parameters. Analyze the spectra (eigenvalue distributions) of these local Hessians across training, in 111 experiments over 37 datasets. Correlate spectral properties with generalization, overfitting, underparameterization, and expressivity to reveal structural regularities.

Result: Identified consistent regularities in how local Hessian spectra evolve during training and found correlations between spectral properties and generalization performance. Demonstrated that layer-wise curvature encodes information about model capacity and stability, supporting a framework that connects optimization geometry to functional behavior.

Conclusion: Layer-wise Hessian analysis provides a practical and principled tool to diagnose and guide neural network design and training. By linking local geometry to generalization and expressivity, this approach offers insights for architecture decisions and training stability.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: I-RAVEN-X is a symbolic benchmark to test LLMs and LRMs on generalized analogical and mathematical reasoning under increased operand complexity, attribute variety, and perceptual uncertainty; LRMs improve productivity and systematicity on longer chains and broader attributes but still struggle with uncertainty and probabilistic outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess generalization and robustness of reasoning models (LLMs vs LRMs) under higher complexity and perceptual uncertainty, and evaluate their ability to handle probabilistic reasoning.

Method: Introduce I-RAVEN-X by extending I-RAVEN with more operands, wider attribute ranges, and perceptual uncertainty; conduct empirical comparisons between LLMs and LRMs on longer reasoning relations and varied attributes, measuring productivity, systematicity, and performance under uncertainty.

Result: LRMs exhibit improved productivity and systematicity for longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively, compared to LLMs; however, LRMs remain significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

Conclusion: LRMs advance capabilities in structured reasoning but ongoing limitations in uncertain and probabilistic reasoning indicate a need for new approaches to handle uncertainty and to model multiple probabilistic outcomes.

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X
extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively

TL;DR: Momentum enables convergence in stochastic DC optimization with small batch sizes; without momentum, convergence can fail; the proposed momentum-based method converges provably and shows strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic DC optimization is common in machine learning, but practical small-batch regimes are poorly understood. Existing methods often require large batches or strong noise assumptions, limiting applicability.

Method: Introduce a momentum-based algorithm for stochastic DC optimization and prove convergence under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions (on the concave part) for any batch size; also demonstrate that without momentum convergence may fail regardless of stepsize.

Result: The algorithm achieves provable convergence under mild assumptions for any batch size and exhibits strong empirical performance in experiments.

Conclusion: Momentum is essential for convergence in stochastic DC optimization with small batch sizes; the proposed momentum-based approach provides reliable convergence and strong empirical results.

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

### [452] [Convergence Rates for Gradient Descent on the Edge of Stability in Overparametrised Least Squares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17506)
*Lachlan Ewen MacDonald,Hancheng Min,Leandro Palma,Salma Tarmoun,Ziqing Xu,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GD with large learning rates in an overparameterized least squares problem converges non-monotonically toward a flat global minimum, thanks to a geometric decomposition on a manifold of global minimizers; three regimes (subcritical, critical, supercritical) yield distinct convergence behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain the non-monotone, edge-of-stability behavior observed in training neural networks under large step sizes and provide quantitative convergence rates in an analytically tractable setting.

Method: Assume an overparameterized least squares problem where the set of global minimizers forms a Riemannian manifold M. Decompose GD dynamics into components parallel to M (treated as Riemannian gradient descent on sharpness) and orthogonal to M (a bifurcating normal dynamics). Analyze convergence in three learning-rate regimes: subcritical, critical, and supercritical.

Result: Derived convergence rates in the three regimes: (a) subcritical: finite-time stabilization to a suboptimal flat minimum; (b) critical: persistent instability with power-law convergence to the optimally flat minimum; (c) supercritical: persistent instability with linear convergence to an orbit of period two around the optimally flat minimum.

Conclusion: The work provides a geometric framework that explains edge-of-stability dynamics, linking large-learning-rate GD behavior to the geometry of the global minimizers manifold and yielding regime-specific convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

*Hoang Pham,The-Anh Ta,Tom Jacobs,Rebekka Burkholz,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graphon-based theory for analyzing sparse neural networks via Graphon NTK; bridges pruning patterns and trainability in the infinite-width limit, with empirical spectral validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why pruning-induced sparse structures differ in trainability at the same sparsity level and provide a principled, scalable framework to study sparse networks.

Method: Model sparse connectivity as graphons in the infinite-width limit, postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis, derive the Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK), perform spectral analysis, and validate correlations with training dynamics across pruning methods.

Result: Spectral properties of Graphon NTK correlate with observed training dynamics; different pruning methods correspond to distinct graphons, accounting for varying convergence behaviors of sparse networks.

Conclusion: A Graphon-based framework offers a unifying theory linking connectivity patterns to trainability, enabling principled analysis and design of pruning methods for sparse neural networks.

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively
remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFE-D is an attention-based framework that detects Parkinson's-related driving anomalies by integrating multi-sensor vehicle data, validated on Logitech G29 and CARLA, achieving 96.8% accuracy


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease can subtly impair driving through motor symptoms, creating pathology-driven safety threats that current drowsiness/distraction detectors miss; there is a need to bridge the gap by detecting disease-related driving deviations.

Method: Analyze PD symptomatology to link motor impairments with driving performance; fuse data from multiple vehicle control components to form a behavioral profile; develop an attention-based network that prioritizes spatiotemporal features for robust anomaly detection under physiological variability; validate on hardware (Logitech G29) and simulation (CARLA) across three road maps.

Result: The framework achieved 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal versus Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

Conclusion: SAFE-D offers a novel, pathology-aware approach to driving anomaly detection, potentially enhancing safety for PWPD by identifying subclinical motor-driven deviations; demonstrated via hardware-in-the-loop and simulation with strong performance, though external validity and real-world deployment require further study.

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and

### [455] [Curiosity Meets Cooperation: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Long-Tail Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17520)
*Canran Xiao,Chuangxin Zhao,Zong Ke,Fei Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A curiosity-driven, cooperative game-theoretic framework for multi-label learning that distributes labels among multiple players with rarity- and disagreement-based bonuses to address long-tail imbalance, yielding tail-aware gradients and improved Rare-F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tail label imbalance in multi-label learning causes rare but important labels to be underrepresented; existing approaches often rely on hand-tuned class weights and lack principled tail robustness.

Method: Divide the label space among several cooperating players who share a global accuracy payoff and earn additional curiosity rewards that increase with label rarity and inter-player disagreement. Curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without hand-tuned class weights. Gradient best-response updates ascend a differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points.

Result: Theoretical: convergence to tail-aware stationary points that tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Empirically: state-of-the-art gains on conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets, up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3; ablations show emergent division of labour and faster consensus on rare classes.

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL offers a principled, scalable route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

*Sidney Bender,Ole Delzer,Jan Herrmann,Heike Antje Marxfeld,Klaus-Robert Müller,Grégoire Montavon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFKD uses counterfactual data generation and knowledge distillation to robustify models against spurious correlations without confounder labels, enriching and reweighting data to achieve balanced generalization across groups across five datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations cause Clever Hans predictors in deep models. Group-robust methods like Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) require group labels and perform poorly when labels are unavailable, subgroup samples are scarce, or multiple confounders fragment data.

Method: Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD) generates diverse counterfactuals and leverages a human annotator to iteratively adjust decision boundaries via knowledge distillation. It does not require confounder labels, scales to multiple confounders, and reweights while enriching underrepresented groups. An ablation study examines the impact of the counterfactual explainer and teacher model.

Result: CFKD shows effectiveness across five datasets, including synthetic tasks and an industrial application, with strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced spurious correlations. It achieves balanced generalization across groups and scales to multiple confounders. Ablation highlights the importance of the chosen explainer and teacher.

Conclusion: CFKD provides a practical, label-free, scalable approach to mitigating spurious correlations, outperforming DFR by both reweighting undersampled groups and enriching them with new data, thus improving robust generalization across diverse data populations.

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

### [457] [How Does Label Noise Gradient Descent Improve Generalization in the Low SNR Regime?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17526)
*Wei Huang,Andi Han,Yujin Song,Yilan Chen,Denny Wu,Difan Zou,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In a low-SNR setting, adding label noise during gradient updates for a two-layer neural network suppresses memorization of the noise, enabling faster signal growth and better generalization than standard gradient descent, which overfits to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks with high capacity tend to memorize noisy labels, harming generalization in low-SNR data. Label noise has been observed to act as implicit regularization; this work investigates whether injecting label noise directly into gradient updates can improve test performance in challenging regimes, with theoretical analysis in an idealized setting.

Method: Theoretical analysis of training a two-layer neural network with a label-noise gradient descent (LN-GD) algorithm on a signal-noise data model, comparing against standard gradient descent (GD). The authors prove that LN-GD suppresses noise memorization and promotes signal growth, leading to better generalization in low SNR.

Result: LN-GD reduces memorization of noise and achieves good generalization under low SNR, whereas standard GD overfits to the noise and has a non-vanishing lower bound on test error in the same setting, highlighting a clear performance gap.

Conclusion: Introducing label noise into gradient updates can serve as an effective regularizer to prevent noise memorization and improve generalization in low-SNR regimes; provides theoretical separation between LN-GD and standard GD, suggesting promising directions for training with gradient-level noise.

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

### [458] [Reliable Inference in Edge-Cloud Model Cascades via Conformal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17543)
*Jiayi Huang,Sangwoo Park,Nicola Paoletti,Osvaldo Simeone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAb: a conformal-alignment cascade for edge-cloud inference that guarantees cloud-like conditional coverage while reducing cloud offloads, via a multiple-hypothesis testing framed escalation and tunable risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices use compact models but must maintain reliability. There is a need for guarantees that edge predictions satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage, balancing latency and accuracy.

Method: Introduce conformal alignment-based cascading (CAb). Frame escalation from edge to cloud as a multiple-hypothesis testing problem and tailor conformal alignment (CA) to decide which inputs can be safely processed at the edge. Works with arbitrary edge prediction sets (including CP variants) and provides a bound on the average fraction of edge decisions meeting cloud-level conditional coverage, with a tunable risk level.

Result: Empirically preserves the target cloud-level conditional coverage for edge predictions; reduces offloading to the cloud; side effects include modest increases in edge-prediction set size; validated on CIFAR-100 and TeleQnA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CAb offers statistically guaranteed conditional coverage in edge-cloud cascades with a controllable trade-off between coverage, deferral rate, and set size, and generalizes to various edge models and conformal-prediction variants.

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

*Yichen Liu,Yan Lin,Shengnan Guo,Zeyu Zhou,Youfang Lin,Huaiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajMamba introduces an efficient, travel-purpose-aware trajectory learning framework that fuses GPS and road perspectives, with pre-training and mask-based distillation to compress trajectories while preserving semantics, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Travel purposes depend on road/POI semantics encoded in textual addresses and descriptions, which imposes heavy computational burden; real-world trajectories also contain redundant points, hurting efficiency and embedding quality.

Method: 1) Traj-Mamba Encoder jointly models GPS and road perspectives of trajectories. 2) Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training integrates travel semantics into embeddings without adding extra overhead. 3) Knowledge Distillation Pre-training uses a learnable mask generator to identify key trajectory points and produce compressed embeddings.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TrajMamba delivers robust, semantically rich trajectory representations with reduced redundancy, enabling efficient, travel-purpose-aware learning at scale.

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture rich, structured information in data and mitigate limitations of purely autoregressive decoders by integrating latent factors learned without labeled supervision.

Method: Extend the decoder Transformer to be conditioned on random latent variables; learn these latents with a variational procedure (VAE-like) jointly with the transformer objective, enabling unsupervised latent conditioning.

Result: Empirical evaluations show substantial improvements on downstream tasks when conditioning on learned latent variables.

Conclusion: Incorporating unsupervised latent conditioning into decoder Transformers yields performance gains and is a promising approach for enhancing generative modeling."

Abstract: We propose an extension of the decoder Transformer that conditions its
generative process on random latent variables which are learned without
supervision thanks to a variational procedure. Experimental evaluations show
that allowing such a conditioning translates into substantial improvements on
downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes verifiable properties for evaluating time-series anomaly detection, showing current metrics are inconsistent and proposing a guaranteed-accurate metric framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical time-series tasks require reliable, comparable evaluation metrics; existing metrics yield misleading results due to lacking formal properties.

Method: Define a set of verifiable properties for anomaly-detection metrics, evaluate 37 widely used metrics against these properties, prove many do not satisfy all properties, and construct LARM and its stricter variant ALARM.

Result: Most existing metrics satisfy only a subset of the properties; none satisfy all of them. LARM provably satisfies all properties; ALARM extends LARM to meet stricter requirements.

Conclusion: A principled framework for evaluating time-series anomaly detection is established, enabling consistent comparisons across methods via the LARM/ALARM metrics.

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

*Jyler Menard,R. A. Mansbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Further compressing latent space via dimensionality reduction, combined with organizing representations by physicochemical properties and labels, can improve interpretability and efficiency of optimizing antimicrobial activity in deep generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) inhabit an enormous sequence space, and deep generative models like VAEs provide continuous latent representations but suffer from limited interpretability and lack rigorous latent-space quality metrics. The work investigates whether dimensionality reduction and property-guided organization can facilitate AMP design.

Method: Train deep generative models (VAEs) to model AMP sequences, apply dimensionality reduction to the latent space, and organize the reduced space by physicochemical properties. Evaluate interpretability and optimization efficiency for antimicrobial activity, including scenarios with varying amounts of labeled data.

Result: Further reduction of the latent space can be beneficial when the space is organized with more relevant information. The dimensionality-reduced search space tends to be more interpretable. It is possible to organize the latent space with different physicochemical properties, even at varying percentages of available labels, improving optimization efficiency for antimicrobial activity.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction and property-guided latent-space organization improve interpretability and optimization efficiency in AMP design using deep generative models, supporting a strategy for more effective exploration of sequence space under limited labeling.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

*Ludi Li,Junbin Mao,Hanhe Lin,Xu Tian,Fang-Xiang Wu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEPerFed is a communication-efficient personalized federated learning framework for multi-pulse MRI classification that uses client-side historical risk and mean gradients to handle data heterogeneity, plus a hierarchical SVD scheme to reduce communication; validated on five tasks with code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for multi-center MRI classification faces two key challenges: data heterogeneity across institutions which hurts convergence, and large model sizes causing high communication overhead. Privacy-preserving collaboration is desired, motivating a FL-based approach.

Method: CEPerFed introduces two main ideas: (1) client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization—risk gradients weight contributions from other clients to improve local update reliability; mean gradients enforce consistency between local updates and the global optimization direction for stable convergence; (2) a hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy to transmit only the most informative components of model updates, reducing communication without sacrificing performance.

Result: Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of CEPerFed, achieving improved convergence and/or accuracy under data heterogeneity with reduced communication overhead. The authors plan to release code upon acceptance at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: CEPerFed successfully addresses both data heterogeneity and communication efficiency in federated learning for multi-pulse MRI classification, offering a practical, privacy-preserving approach with open-source code forthcoming.

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

### [464] [Handling Extreme Class Imbalance: Using GANs in Data Augmentation for Suicide Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17661)
*Vaishnavi Visweswaraiah,Tanvi Banerjee,William Romine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAN-based data augmentation enables training ML/DL models on a highly imbalanced suicide-prediction dataset, yielding strong performance across models, with tradeoffs in sensitivity and specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide prediction datasets are severely imbalanced and positive cases are scarce, limiting model performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to synthesize additional samples to balance the data and improve predictive modeling.

Method: Start with 656 samples including only 4 positives. Use GANs to generate synthetic samples to augment training data. Train multiple models from interpretable (e.g., Logistic Regression) to black-box (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and evaluate on real test data. Report weighted metrics (precision, recall, F1) and case-level sensitivity/specificity for suicide attempt detection.

Result: On real test data: Logistic Regression: precision 0.99, recall 0.85, F1 0.91; Random Forest: precision 0.98, recall 0.99, F1 0.99; SVM: precision 0.99, recall 0.76, F1 0.86. LR and SVM detected the single suicide attempt (sensitivity 1.0) but misclassified some non-attempts (specificity 0.85 and 0.76). RF detected zero attempts (sensitivity 0.0) with no false positives (specificity 1.0). GAN played a key role in generating synthetic data to support the modeling.

Conclusion: GAN-based augmentation can bolster predictive performance in imbalanced suicide prediction tasks. Different models exhibit distinct tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity; RF offers perfect specificity at the cost of missing attempts, while LR/SVM balance detection and false positives. Overall, GANs are useful for augmenting scarce positive samples and enhancing suicide prevention modeling.

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cascaded approach for open-vocabulary detection in remote sensing, combining zero-shot OV detection with a lightweight few-shot classifier and FLAME active learning for fast, annotation-efficient domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot OV detectors struggle with fine-grained, domain-specific RS classes due to linguistic ambiguity; there is a need for rapid, low-cost adaptation that preserves high recall while improving precision in RS tasks.

Method: 1) Use a large pre-trained open-vocabulary detector to generate high-recall proposals (zero-shot). 2) Refine with a compact, real-time trained classifier using only a handful of user-annotated examples to boost precision. 3) Employ FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy, to select the most informative samples by estimating uncertainty near the decision boundary via density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. 4) Avoid costly full-model fine-tuning; adaptation happens in under a minute.

Result: The method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, delivering improved accuracy with minimal annotation and computation, demonstrating a practical and resource-efficient pathway for adapting foundation models to RS user needs.

Conclusion: A cascaded, active-learning-guided framework can effectively adapt open-vocabulary detectors to RS domains by combining zero-shot broad generalization with fast, few-shot specialization, enabling instant, cost-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization uses an LLM to convert natural-language feedback into scalar utilities for optimization, enabling flexible priors and robust uncertainty, outperforming BO baselines and LLM-only methods in feedback-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world goals are nuanced and hard to quantify; existing BO and preferential BO restrict feedback formats or require domain-specific kernels; a natural, flexible interface is needed that preserves BO's theory and efficiency.

Method: Combine LLM-driven utility extraction from textual feedback with Bayesian optimization over a numeric search space; incorporate user priors without manual kernel design; maintain uncertainty via BO's probabilistic model; compare against conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers; evaluate in feedback-limited regimes.

Result: Hybrid approach yields improved performance over baselines; maintains sample efficiency and calibrated uncertainty; more natural decision interface; especially effective when feedback is scarce or limited.

Conclusion: Language-in-the-loop framework provides flexible, scalable integration of natural language feedback into optimization without heavy domain-specific tailoring; broad applicability across real-world problems; enhances decision-making with LLM-assisted utilities while preserving BO guarantees.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Links policy gradient methods with dynamic programming in MMDPs via CADP, develops contraction-aware algorithms for risk-averse ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC, and proposes convergent model-free Q-learning for these objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle model uncertainty and risk aversion in sequential decision making by connecting gradient-based and DP approaches, and to provide computationally viable algorithms.

Method: Proposes CADP to adjust model weights for monotone improvements; derives contraction conditions for exponential ERM Bellman; presents ERM-TRC/EVaR-TRC value/policy iteration and LP, plus model-free Q-learning algorithms leveraging monotonicity.

Result: CADP achieves monotone policy improvement to a local maximum; establishes contraction criteria and existence of stationary optimal policies for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC; provides algorithms to compute them; Q-learning methods converge to optimal risk-averse values.

Conclusion: The work delivers a cohesive framework for risk-averse MMDPs, with both model-based and model-free algorithms and convergence guarantees for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

### [468] [Closing the Sim2Real Performance Gap in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17709)
*Akhil S Anand,Shambhuraj Sawant,Jasper Hoffmann,Dirk Reinhardt,Sebastien Gros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-level RL to close the Sim2Real gap by adapting simulator parameters via an outer loop to optimize the real-world performance of a policy trained in simulation; bypasses reliance on proxy simulator metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policies trained in high-fidelity simulators often underperform in the real world; existing simulators' accuracy/variability metrics do not reliably predict real-world performance, necessitating methods that align simulation with real outcomes.

Method: Formulate a bi-level RL framework: inner level trains a policy purely in simulation, while the outer level adapts simulator parameters and in-sim reward functions with the objective of maximizing real-world policy performance; derive mathematical tools for such bi-level optimization and validate them in simple example settings.

Result: The paper provides theoretical derivations and shows validation on simple examples, demonstrating the feasibility of bi-level RL to close the Sim2Real performance gap.

Conclusion: A bi-level RL framework is a promising direction to directly optimize for real-world performance, potentially reducing the Sim2Real gap; future work should address scalability, stability, and application to more complex tasks.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

### [469] [Enabling Fine-Grained Operating Points for Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17727)
*Ege Beyazit,KL Navaneet,Prashant Mathur,Roi Blanco,Vidit Bansal,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances the operational granularity of black-box LLM classifiers by generating more diverse, finer-grained probabilities, overcoming the inherent low-cardinality verbal outputs to enable tighter performance control, while maintaining accuracy and low cost across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box LLMs offer practical, low-cost solutions but suffer from limited numerical output granularity due to biased, rounded verbal probabilities. This hampers enforcing strict performance constraints and fine-grained decision thresholds.

Method: First diagnose why outputs have low cardinality. Test standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation, and confidence elicitation; these yield limited gains. Propose efficient approaches to substantially increase the number and diversity of usable operating points (thresholds) without harming performance or adding inference cost.

Result: The proposed approaches yield finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

Conclusion: The methods enable finer-grained control of black-box LLM classifiers without sacrificing performance or increasing inference costs.

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

### [470] [Prediction of Sea Ice Velocity and Concentration in the Arctic Ocean using Physics-informed Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17756)
*Younghyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-informed PINN using HIS-Unet improves daily sea ice velocity and concentration predictions, outperforming fully data-driven models, especially with limited data and in melting/early freezing seasons and fast-ice regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven ML models struggle with generalization and physical consistency in changing Arctic conditions, where ice becomes thinner and melts faster; integrating physics helps ensure plausible outputs even with limited or shifting data.

Method: Adapt Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) into a physics-informed neural network by adding a physics loss and physics-aware activation functions to enforce physical constraints, training on SIV and SIC with potentially small datasets.

Result: PINN outperforms fully data-driven models in daily SIV and SIC predictions, notably for SIC during melting/early freezing and near fast-moving ice regions, and remains effective with small sample sizes.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical knowledge via PINNs yields more physically consistent and generalizable sea ice predictions under changing Arctic conditions, reducing reliance on large, representative datasets.

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

### [471] [Atlas-based Manifold Representations for Interpretable Riemannian Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17772)
*Ryan A. Robinett,Sophia A. Madejski,Kyle Ruark,Samantha J. Riesenfeld,Lorenzo Orecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes atlas-based manifold learning to operate directly on latent manifolds instead of paving to Euclidean space; introduces a differentiable atlas data structure with a learning heuristic; demonstrates efficiency, accuracy, interpretability, and robustness on Klein bottle classification and RNA velocity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manifold-learning methods primarily embed data into R^D, which can erode intrinsic manifold structure when D is close to the latent dimension d. There is a need for learning on the latent manifold itself using differentiable atlases to better preserve geometry and enable Riemannian optimization.

Method: Develop a generic, differentiable atlas data structure and implement a learning heuristic (unsupervised) to construct the atlas from point cloud data. Integrate this into a workflow allowing Riemannian optimization on the manifold and validate with targeted experiments (Klein bottle classification and hematopoietic RNA velocity analysis).

Result: The approach demonstrates advantages in efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. In supervised Klein bottle classification and RNA velocity analysis of hematopoietic data, it yields improved interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: Atlas-based differentiable manifold learning shows promise for operating directly on latent manifolds, offering interpretability and robustness benefits. The work provides a proof of concept and suggests further exploration of atlas-based Riemannian optimization for manifold-valued learning.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

### [472] [Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776)
*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sample-wise metric framework to quantify forgetting and backward transfer in post-training of language models, revealing heterogeneous effects across training modalities, scales, and data, with moderate forgetting but varying backward transfer that is data-scale dependent and not mitigated by model merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional averages mask non-uniform forgetting effects. The paper argues that understanding how post-training reshapes pretrained knowledge requires tracking fact-level transitions (1->0 and 0->1) and adjusting for chance in multiple-choice tasks.

Method: Introduce a transition-counting metric for each fact: 1->0 for forgetting and 0->1 for backward transfer. Use chance-adjusted accuracies for MC benchmarks. Apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales, across domain-continual pretraining, RL/SFT, and instruction tuning. Compare different post-training regimes and model-merging attempts.

Result: Key findings include: (1) Domain-continual pretraining causes moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT on base models and instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math/logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) RL/SFT on instruction-tuned models is data-scale sensitive: small scales show small effects, larger scales show mixed results; (4) model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale, enabling more informed progress toward generally capable AI systems, while highlighting the need for better controls and further study of scale-dependent effects.

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

### [473] [Inference-Time Compute Scaling For Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17786)
*Adam Stecklov,Noah El Rimawi-Fine,Mathieu Blanchette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-time compute scaling for Flow Matching (FM) preserving the linear interpolant improves sample quality with more compute, extending to unconditional protein generation and scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in inference-time scaling for Flow Matching; prior work replacing the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving interpolant (Kim et al., 2025) sacrifices sampling efficiency; inference-time scaling has largely been explored only for vision tasks, and its applicability to scientific domains is unexplored.

Method: Introduce novel inference-time scaling procedures for Flow Matching that preserve the linear interpolant during sampling; evaluate on image generation and, for the first time, unconditional protein generation.

Result: Sample quality consistently improves as inference compute increases; FM inference-time scaling can be applied to scientific domains (e.g., unconditional protein generation).

Conclusion: Inference-time scaling for Flow Matching is effective, preserves sampling efficiency, and generalizes beyond vision to scientific domains.

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

### [474] [Functional Distribution Networks (FDN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17794)
*Omer Haq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Functional Distribution Networks (FDN) introduce an input-conditioned distribution over network weights, creating predictive mixtures whose uncertainty adapts to each input. Trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo sampling, FDN is evaluated with a protocol that separates interpolation from extrapolation and tests OOD sanity checks. Benchmarking against strong baselines suggests competitive accuracy, calibration, and shift-awareness, with the aim of enabling practical, modular OOD-aware neural regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard regressors tend to be overconfident under distribution shift. There is a need for models whose predictive uncertainty adapts with the input, and evaluation protocols that clearly separate interpolation from extrapolation and stress OOD behavior.

Method: Define an input-conditioned distribution over network weights to induce predictive mixtures. Train the model using a beta-ELBO objective and perform Monte Carlo sampling for inference. Propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates interpolation vs extrapolation and imposes OOD sanity checks (e.g., predictive likelihood should degrade under shift while in-distribution accuracy and calibration remain stable). Benchmark against Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched parameter and update budgets, using standard diagnostics for accuracy, calibration, and shift-awareness.

Result: The paper reports benchmarking on standard regression tasks showing competitive accuracy, calibration, and shift-awareness compared to strong baselines under matched budgets and diagnostics.

Conclusion: The framework (FDN) and its evaluation protocol provide a practical, modular approach to OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression, bridging uncertainty-aware modeling with scalable evaluation.

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

### [475] [Unbiased Gradient Low-Rank Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17802)
*Rui Pan,Yang Luo,Yuxing Liu,Yang You,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM) is introduced—an unbiased, memory-efficient low-rank optimizer for LLM training that matches Muon’s convergence guarantees and often beats GaLore and even full-parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory-efficient gradient low-rank optimizers like GaLore often bias optimization and lack convergence guarantees, leading to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. There is a need for debiasing techniques that preserve memory efficiency and convergence.

Method: Layerwise sampling-based debiasing to create an unbiased low-rank optimizer by integrating GaLore’s mechanism with the Muon algorithm, resulting in GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). The authors provide theoretical convergence guarantees matching Muon while retaining low-rank memory savings.

Result: Theoretically, GUM matches the convergence guarantees of Muon. Empirically, it outperforms GaLore and sometimes surpasses full-parameter training on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining tasks, aided by a more uniform distribution of knowledge across layers.

Conclusion: GUM delivers unbiased, convergent, memory-efficient optimization for large language model training, improving memorization and efficiency by better distributing knowledge across layers and fully leveraging the model parameter space.

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

*João Carlos Virgolino Soares,Gabriel Fischer Abati,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VAR-SLAM is an ORB-SLAM3-based visual SLAM system that combines a lightweight semantic filter for known moving objects with Barron’s adaptive robust loss to handle unknown moving objects. It estimates the robust-loss shape parameter online from residuals, enabling adaptation between Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise. Evaluated on multiple dynamic-env datasets, it achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robustness, up to 25% lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM, while running at ~27 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments cause SLAM inaccuracies; existing methods rely on semantic filtering limited to known object classes or fixed robust kernels that fail for unknown moving objects. A method that adapts to both known and unknown dynamic elements is needed to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: Integrates VAR-SLAM within an ORB-SLAM3 framework using (1) a lightweight semantic keypoint filter to remove features on known moving objects; (2) Barron’s adaptive robust loss with an online-estimated shape parameter derived from residuals to adapt the robustification strength to unknown moving objects; (3) maintains real-time performance (~27 FPS) on average.

Result: Empirical evaluation on TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets shows improved trajectory accuracy and robustness over baselines, achieving up to 25% lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM on challenging sequences.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining semantic filtering for known dynamics and online-adaptive robust statistics for unknown dynamics yields better SLAM robustness and accuracy in dynamic scenes without sacrificing real-time performance.

Abstract: Visual SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging, as several existing
methods rely on semantic filtering that only handles known object classes, or
use fixed robust kernels that cannot adapt to unknown moving objects, leading
to degraded accuracy when they appear in the scene. We present VAR-SLAM (Visual
Adaptive and Robust SLAM), an ORB-SLAM3-based system that combines a
lightweight semantic keypoint filter to deal with known moving objects, with
Barron's adaptive robust loss to handle unknown ones. The shape parameter of
the robust kernel is estimated online from residuals, allowing the system to
automatically adjust between Gaussian and heavy-tailed behavior. We evaluate
VAR-SLAM on the TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets, which
include both known and unknown moving objects. Results show improved trajectory
accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 25%
lower ATE RMSE than NGD-SLAM on challenging sequences, while maintaining
performance at 27 FPS on average.

TL;DR: 3-DOF cable-driven gripper (DeGrip) enables autonomous disassembly of EOL desktops in confined spaces; evaluated in Isaac Sim showing capability for arbitrary configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-of-life electronics disassembly is challenging due to tight spaces and varied component layouts, and existing ML methods are hampered by hardware constraints. A compact, specialized gripper could enable more robust autonomous disassembly.

Method: Design and integration of DeGrip with 3 DOF and a cable-driven transmission to reduce size; wrist actuation decoupled from jaw; mounted on a robotic manipulator. An EOL desktop disassembly environment was created in Isaac Sim to test performance in confined spaces and arbitrary configurations.

Result: Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates DeGrip's capability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble components across arbitrary configurations, validating its effectiveness for EOL desktop disassembly.

Conclusion: DeGrip represents a promising hardware solution for autonomous EOL disassembly in constrained environments, supported by a dedicated simulation environment; future work should include real-world validation, robustness analyses, and broader task coverage.

Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a
long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have
shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in
real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for
the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of
freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly
environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven
transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in
confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and
jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac
Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to
demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble
components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the
capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cosmos-Surg-dVRK fine-tunes Cosmos WFM for autonomous surgical policy evaluation, enabling automated online benchmarking via a video classifier and showing strong real-dVRK correlation on suture tasks and promising ex-vivo alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, reproducible, and cost-efficient evaluation of autonomous surgical policies without relying solely on expensive physical robots (e.g., dVRK), by leveraging world foundation models to simulate high-fidelity surgical tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a Cosmos World Foundation Model to create Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and train a video classifier (V-JEPA 2) to assess policy rollouts. Evaluate on tabletop suture pad tasks and ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy within the Cosmos environment, comparing online outcomes to real-dVRK results and harmonizing human labels with classifier outputs.

Result: Demonstrates strong correlation between Cosmos-Surg-dVRK rollouts and real-dVRK policy outcomes for suture tasks; good agreement between human labels and the V-JEPA 2 video classifier; preliminary ex-vivo experiments show alignment with real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: The Cosmos-Surg-dVRK platform enables automated, scalable benchmarking of surgical policies with reduced reliance on costly physical experiments, supporting progression toward more complex, real-world surgical tasks.

Abstract: The rise of surgical robots and vision-language-action models has accelerated
the development of autonomous surgical policies and efficient assessment
strategies. However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic
platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high
costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution.
World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach
to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation,
with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune
of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables
fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We
evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop
suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between
online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si
platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA
2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo
porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising
alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential
for more complex surgical procedures.

*Jierui Peng,Yanyan Zhang,Yicheng Duan,Tuo Liang,Vipin Chaudhary,Yu Yin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NEBULA introduces a unified evaluation ecosystem for single-arm manipulation with a dual-axis protocol (capability tests + stress tests), plus a standardized API and aggregated dataset to enable diagnose, reproducible evaluation, and cross-dataset training; it reveals gaps in current Vision-Language-Action models where end-task metrics mask key skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA evaluation relies on coarse end-task success metrics and a fragmented data landscape, hindering precise skill diagnosis, robustness assessment, and the development of generalist agents.

Method: NEBULA proposes a dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained capability tests for precise skill diagnosis with systematic stress tests to measure robustness, plus a standardized API and a large-scale aggregated dataset to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparisons.

Result: Applying NEBULA shows that top-performing VLA models struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation; these weaknesses are largely obscured by conventional end-task metrics, highlighting the need for capability- and robustness-focused evaluation.

Conclusion: NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents by enabling precise skill diagnosis, assessing robustness, and reducing data fragmentation through a unified ecosystem.

Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the
coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis
or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is
exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research
and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that
enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel
dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability
tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that
measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset
are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and
fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle
with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which
are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By
measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA
provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

### [480] [Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16281)
*Yilin Wu,Anqi Li,Tucker Hermans,Fabio Ramos,Andrea Bajcsy,Claudia P'erez-D'Arpino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free, runtime policy steering method to align reasoning-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies with their actions. By sampling multiple action sequences from the same model, simulating outcomes, and using a pre-trained vision-language model to pick the sequence that best matches the textual plan, the approach improves robustness to out-of-distribution perturbations and enables novel behavior composition without retraining, achieving up to ~15% gains. It also adds reasoning-annotated LIBERO-100 extensions and OOD evaluation environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models generate step-by-step plans (CoT-like) but their executed actions may diverge from the intended plan, especially under semantic/visual distribution shifts. This embodied CoT faithfulness gap degrades task success in real-world or OOD scenarios. A training-free, runtime alignment mechanism aims to mitigate this without expensive retraining.

Method: From a VLA's intermediate textual plan, generate multiple candidate action sequences using the same model. Estimate each sequence's outcome via simulation. Use a pre-trained Vision-Language Model to evaluate how well each outcome aligns with the textual plan, and execute only the sequence that best matches the plan. This runtime steering converts natural action diversity into robustness. Additional contributions include a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100 and environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation to test robustness and generalization.

Result: Demonstrates up to 15% performance gains over prior work on behavior composition tasks. Gains scale with compute and data diversity and show robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations. The method enables novel behavior composition without additional retraining and is validated on a reasoning-annotated LIBERO-100 extension and OOD environments.

Conclusion: Runtime policy steering effectively aligns VLA reasoning with action, turning potential planning diversity into a robustness asset. It offers a training-free, scalable path to improve OOD robustness and enable new behavior compositions, backed by extended datasets and OOD evaluation environments.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic
instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level
actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still
miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness,
and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for
reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan,
our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model,
predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language
Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own
textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual
reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error
into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations
and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also
contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment
variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance
gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and
data diversity. Project Website at:

### [481] [SPOT: Sensing-augmented Trajectory Planning via Obstacle Threat Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16308)
*Chi Zhang,Xian Huang,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified sensing-augmented planning framework (SPOT) for UAVs using a Gaussian Process obstacle belief to integrate sensing with planning, enabling real-time, observation-aware trajectory optimization and earlier dynamic obstacle detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-depth-camera UAVs suffer from limited field of view and blind spots; existing methods often separate sensing from planning, leading to delayed obstacle responses.

Method: Constructs a Gaussian Process–based obstacle belief map to unify detected and potential obstacles, applies a collision-aware inference to transform spatial uncertainty into a time-varying observation urgency map, and optimizes trajectories with urgency integrated into a differentiable objective for real-time planning (sub-10 ms).

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments show potential dynamic obstacles detected 2.8 seconds earlier and dynamic obstacle visibility increased by over 500%, enabling safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.

Conclusion: SPOT provides an observation-aware planning framework that merges sensing and motion optimization, yielding faster, more robust obstacle avoidance in challenging UAV scenarios.

Abstract: UAVs equipped with a single depth camera encounter significant challenges in
dynamic obstacle avoidance due to limited field of view and inevitable blind
spots. While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been
proposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion
planning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed
obstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT
(Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning
framework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly
incorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our
method is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a
unified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed)
and potential obstacles. This belief is further processed through a
collision-aware inference mechanism that transforms spatial uncertainty and
trajectory proximity into a time-varying observation urgency map. By
integrating urgency values within the current field of view, we define
differentiable objectives that enable real-time, observation-aware trajectory
planning with computation times under 10 ms. Simulation and real-world
experiments in dynamic, cluttered, and occluded environments show that our
method detects potential dynamic obstacles 2.8 seconds earlier than baseline
approaches, increasing dynamic obstacle visibility by over 500\%, and enabling
safe navigation through cluttered, occluded environments.

*Chenrui Tie,Shengxiang Sun,Yudi Lin,Yanbo Wang,Zhongrui Li,Zhouhan Zhong,Jinxuan Zhu,Yiman Pang,Haonan Chen,Junting Chen,Ruihai Wu,Lin Shao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Manual2Skill++ extracts structured connector knowledge from assembly manuals to support end-to-end assembly understanding and execution by representing tasks as hierarchical graphs with connectors as first-class primitives; validated on a 20+ task dataset across furniture, toys, and manufacturing domains in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connectors are the critical 'last mile' in assembly; current planning treats them as afterthought; manuals embed rich connector knowledge; need a way to automatically capture this and integrate into planning/execution.

Method: Propose Manual2Skill++ vision-language framework; use large-scale vision-language model to parse diagrams and annotations in manuals; instantiate hierarchical graphs where nodes are parts/sub-assemblies, edges denote connections; assemble a dataset of >20 tasks; evaluate end-to-end understanding-to-execution pipeline in four complex simulation scenarios with real-world correspondence.

Result: Demonstrates effective extraction of structured connection information and feasibility of end-to-end pipeline; validates across diverse connector types and domain scenarios; provides real-world-correspondence simulation results.

Conclusion: Treating connectors as first-class primitives and leveraging manuals through vision-language parsing enables robust assembly planning/execution; lays groundwork for scalable, knowledge-rich assembly frameworks across domains.

Abstract: Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most
robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating
connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile"
of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion
plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections
ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider
connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including
connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing
inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step
instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework
that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly
manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent
parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships
between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic
diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the
rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a
dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to
validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task
understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in
simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with
real-world correspondence.

*Dan Guo,Xibin Jin,Shuai Wang,Zhigang Wen,Miaowen Wen,Chengzhong Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IPMC (integrated perception, motion, and communication) with imitation-learning-based optimization reduces data uploads and communication overhead in edge robotics by dynamically adapting compression, frequency, and power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge robotics generates large multi-modal data; existing methods ignore the coupling between robotic perception/motion and communication, causing inefficient data transfer.

Method: Proposes the IPMC framework that leverages perception and motion dynamics to adapt communication parameters (compression ratio, transmission frequency, transmit power) and uses learning-to-optimize (LTO) via imitation learning to compute these decisions with significantly lower computation than traditional solvers.

Result: Demonstrates real-time execution and superiority of IPMC; LTO reduces computation by over 10x compared to state-of-the-art optimization solvers.

Conclusion: Integrating perception, motion, and communication with LTO enables adaptive, low-overhead edge robotics and efficient data exchange.

Abstract: Edge robotics involves frequent exchanges of large-volume multi-modal data.
Existing methods ignore the interdependency between robotic functionalities and
communication conditions, leading to excessive communication overhead. This
paper revolutionizes edge robotics systems through integrated perception,
motion, and communication (IPMC). As such, robots can dynamically adapt their
communication strategies (i.e., compression ratio, transmission frequency,
transmit power) by leveraging the knowledge of robotic perception and motion
dynamics, thus reducing the need for excessive sensor data uploads.
Furthermore, by leveraging the learning to optimize (LTO) paradigm, an
imitation learning neural network is designed and implemented, which reduces
the computational complexity by over 10x compared to state-of-the art
optimization solvers. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
IPMC and the real-time execution capability of LTO.

*Lennart Wachowiak,Andrew Coles,Gerard Canal,Oya Celiktutan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dataset paper presenting 1,893 user questions for household robots across 12 categories/70 subcategories, collected via stimuli to inform QA and explanation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in explainable robotics beyond why-questions by understanding the diverse information users want from robots, enabling better conversational interfaces in human-robot interaction.

Method: Created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli depicting robots performing household tasks; recruited 100 participants via Prolific; asked what questions they would ask the robot in each scenario; analyzed questions by taxonomy (12 categories, 70 subcategories); examined distributions and differences between novices and experienced users.

Result: Most frequent question categories are task execution details (22.5%), robot capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments (11.3%). While questions about handling difficult scenarios are less frequent, users rate them as highly important. Novices tend to ask simpler factual questions than experienced users. The dataset can support logging/exposure to conversational interfaces, benchmarking QA modules, and designing explanation strategies.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable foundation for aligning robot explanations with user expectations, guiding what information should be logged and exposed to users, benchmarking QA systems, and developing explanation strategies for household robots.

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces
in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more
important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions
for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12
categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on
why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions,
from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot
would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable
insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect
the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots
performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what
questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the
final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution
details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments
(11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult
scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the
most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users
who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more
experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such
as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter
environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving
instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for
(i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational
interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing
explanation strategies that align with user expectations.

Conclusion: The ORAD-3D dataset and benchmarks aim to accelerate progress in robust perception and planning for off-road autonomy, with open access to data and code to foster community-driven evaluation and development.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in off-road autonomous driving research lies in the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, we present ORAD-3D, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest

*Haokai Ding,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces SPD gripper with a palm and two symmetric fingers that move linearly to achieve parallel gripping on a tabletop, enabling grasping of objects of varying sizes without changing overall gripper height; prototype validated and adaptable to different shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional parallel-gripping systems that rotate or arc at the fingertips, causing the need for height adjustment and potential collisions with the tabletop; enable reliable table-top grasping and create data for deep learning in embodied intelligence.

Method: Proposes a design philosophy and fundamental composition principles for the SPD gripper, including a palm and two identical, symmetrically arranged fingers that can be driven independently or by a single motor; uses a linear fingertip trajectory to realize linear parallel gripping; conducts optimization analysis and builds a prototype for testing.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate successful linear parallel gripping and good adaptability to objects of different shapes/sizes; the prototype validates the design and its potential for data collection to improve deep learning training.

Conclusion: The SPD gripper addresses height-adjustment issues in conventional grippers by delivering linear parallel gripping with adaptive capability; it provides a foundation for robot-assisted grasping and for collecting data to advance embodied intelligence and deep learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robotic gripper, named as the SPD gripper. It
features a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged
fingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips
of the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of
objects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall
height of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping
capabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the
entire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop.
The SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively
addresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive
capabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper
presents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and
optimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper. Based on the design theory, a
robotic gripper prototype was developed and tested. The experimental results
demonstrate that the robotic gripper successfully achieves linear parallel
gripping functionality and exhibits good adaptability. In the context of the
ongoing development of embodied intelligence technologies, this robotic gripper
can assist various robots in achieving effective grasping, laying a solid
foundation for collecting data to enhance deep learning training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend zero-shot object navigation from simple names to intricate natural-language spatial queries while preserving robust semantic mapping.

Method: Decompose instructions into simpler object-level queries; compute intersection of individual semantic belief maps to find co-located regions; validate against original spatial constraints via a large vision-language model; adapt frontier exploration objectives for spatial queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on MultiON and real-world Boston Dynamics Spot using Jetson Orin AGX, demonstrating real-time performance and practical feasibility; available project and videos.

Conclusion: DIV-Nav enables efficient, real-time spatial-query navigation, suggesting a path toward more capable open-vocabulary robotic perception and navigation; future work includes deeper integration with dynamic environments and more robust query validation.

Abstract: Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have
enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an
arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically
designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue
rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial
relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging
robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system
that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i)
Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into
simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection
of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects
co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original,
complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the
frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial
search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our
system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world
deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX. More

Motivation: Address the limited adaptability and rigidity of conventional end-effectors in intelligent industrial automation; need for a compact, adjustable, and robust gripper capable of handling diverse parts and deformable objects.

Method: A differential linkage mechanism with a symmetric modular dual-finger configuration enables linear-parallel grasping. A planetary gear transmission provides synchronized linear motion while allowing independent finger pose adjustments; a kinematically optimized parallelogram palm and differential mechanism enhance rigidity and adaptability.

Result: Demonstrates adaptive grasping across diverse industrial workpieces, including deformables such as citrus fruits. The system reduces Z-axis recalibration requirements by about 30% compared with arc-trajectory grippers and maintains structural rigidity. The palm architecture is compact and leverages optimized parallelogram and differential mechanisms to enable versatile grasping.

Conclusion: SP-Diff advances robotic end-effectors by offering a flexible, adaptive gripper architecture suitable for collaborative robotics, logistics automation, and specialized applications.

TL;DR: Mixture of Skills VLA learns a basis of manipulation skills and adapts to new tasks with a single demonstration via a gradient-free convex L1 optimization, improving generalization on unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models promise general control but often fail to generalize to novel environments, embodiments, or tasks; fast, gradient-free adaptation is needed to bridge this gap.

Method: Pretrain to jointly learn a finite set of basis functions across Open X-Embodiment datasets, creating a structured skill space. At test time, represent a new task as a linear (convex) combination of these skills and infer the coefficients by solving a lightweight L1-minimization problem, without gradient updates.

Result: Lower action-prediction error on 5/5 unseen datasets; succeeds in both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails.

Conclusion: Gradient-free adaptation within a structured skill space enables rapid instantiation of new skills and improves cross-domain robustness for VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained on large robot datasets promise
general-purpose, robust control across diverse domains and embodiments.
However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel
environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA
(MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear
combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining,
MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open
X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time,
adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The
corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex
optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring
gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while
enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower
action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in
both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails
outright. Project page: mos-vla.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cross-national survey (n=22 FRs) on semantic-based situational awareness in robotics during emergencies. Finds generally positive attitudes toward robots, moderate perceived usefulness of semantic info for SA (3.6/5) and predicting unforeseen events (3.9/5); FRs require ~75% accuracy to trust outputs and ~68% to find them useful, indicating willingness to use imperfect AI. Highlights valued semantic types (object identity, spatial relations, risk context) and links attitudes to role, experience, and education, while exposing a gap between lab capabilities and field deployment and calling for closer collaboration between FRs and researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how first responders perceive semantic-enabled SA in robotic systems, aiming to inform design, adoption, and cross-national applicability in emergency response.

Method: Structured questionnaire administered to 22 first responders across eight countries, collecting demographics, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Used Likert-scale measures for usefulness and trust; analyzed correlations with role, experience, and education; identified preferred semantic information types.

Result: FRs overall express positive attitudes toward robots. Semantic information is valued for building SA (3.6/5) and for predicting unforeseen emergencies (3.9/5). Trust in semantic outputs requires ~74.6% accuracy, and usefulness requires ~67.8%. The study identifies object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context as highly valued semantic information, and links preferences to respondent roles, experience, and education. Reveals a lab-field effectiveness gap and a need for closer FR-researcher collaboration.

Conclusion: The work provides novel cross-national insights on semantic-based SA in emergency robotics and informs the design of user-aligned, context-aware robotic systems. It underscores the necessity of ongoing collaboration between FRs and researchers to bridge lab capabilities with field realities.

Abstract: This study investigates First Responders' (FRs) attitudes toward the use of
semantic information and Situational Awareness (SA) in robotic systems during
emergency operations. A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs
across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes
toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that
most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness
of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic
information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies
(mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6\% accuracy to
trust semantic outputs and 67.8\% for them to be considered useful, revealing a
willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools.
  To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one
of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national
context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field,
such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context-and connects
these preferences to the respondents' roles, experience, and education levels.
The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities
and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more
meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights
contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware
robotic systems for emergency response.

TL;DR: Adaptive Invariant EKF improves proprioceptive state estimation for legged robots by online-adapting contact noise and using contact-detection to handle small slips, validated on LeoQuad.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate proprioceptive state estimation is critical for legged locomotion. Traditional slip rejection methods can be brittle under small slips and may cause filter divergence; reducing hardware reliance is desirable.

Method: Employ an Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter with online covariance estimation to dynamically adjust the contact-foot model noise. Use a contact-detection algorithm instead of relying on contact sensors. Validate on a real quadruped (LeoQuad).

Result: Shows enhanced state estimation performance in dynamic locomotion, improved robustness to small slips, and avoidance of filter divergence associated with over-sensitive slip rejection; demonstrated in real-world LeoQuad experiments.

Conclusion: Adaptive covariance-based adjustment of contact noise combined with contact detection improves proprioceptive state estimation and robustness for legged robots across varying contact conditions without extra hardware.

Abstract: State estimation is crucial for legged robots as it directly affects control
performance and locomotion stability. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive
Invariant Extended Kalman Filter to improve proprioceptive state estimation for
legged robots. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the noise level of the
contact foot model based on online covariance estimation, leading to improved
state estimation under varying contact conditions. It effectively handles small
slips that traditional slip rejection fails to address, as overly sensitive
slip rejection settings risk causing filter divergence. Our approach employs a
contact detection algorithm instead of contact sensors, reducing the reliance
on additional hardware. The proposed method is validated through real-world
experiments on the quadruped robot LeoQuad, demonstrating enhanced state
estimation performance in dynamic locomotion scenarios.

*Jia Li,Guoxiang Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic motion planning framework that self-corrects using a formal verifier (STL) across three cascaded modules to generate feasible trajectory sequences; demonstrates superior performance and can be deployed with a lightweight model (Qwen3-4B).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional, domain-specific planner customization and the spatio-temporal coupling that leads to infeasible motions, while mitigating LLM hallucinations by integrating formal verification.

Method: Three cascaded modules are used to prompt LLMs to generate candidate trajectory sequences. Each module assesses feasibility using a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) verifier and iterates until a sequence satisfies spatial, temporal, and logical constraints. The approach distills reasoning into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model for efficient deployment.

Result: Experimental results across multiple scenarios show significant improvement over baselines. The framework demonstrates robust feasibility checking and planning performance, with the reasoning distilled into a smaller model for practical deployment. Supplementary materials are available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework combining LLM-based semantic reasoning with formal STL verification yields robust, feasible motion plans without heavy domain-specific customization, enabling efficient deployment on compact models.

Abstract: Translating natural language instructions into executable motion plans is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Traditional approaches are typically
constrained by their reliance on domain-specific expertise to customize
planners, and often struggle with spatio-temporal couplings that usually lead
to infeasible motions or discrepancies between task planning and motion
execution. Despite the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
high-level semantic reasoning, hallucination could result in infeasible motion
plans. In this paper, we introduce the T3 Planner, an LLM-enabled robotic
motion planning framework that self-corrects it output with formal methods. The
framework decomposes spatio-temporal task constraints via three cascaded
modules, each of which stimulates an LLM to generate candidate trajectory
sequences and examines their feasibility via a Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
verifier until one that satisfies complex spatial, temporal, and logical
constraints is found.Experiments across different scenarios show that T3
Planner significantly outperforms the baselines. The required reasoning can be
distilled into a lightweight Qwen3-4B model that enables efficient deployment.

### [495] [C-Free-Uniform: A Map-Conditioned Trajectory Sampler for Model Predictive Path Integral Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16905)
*Yukang Cao,Rahul Moorthy,O. Goktug Poyrazoglu,Volkan Isler*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces CFU-MPPI, a trajectory sampling method using C-Free-Uniform control inputs conditioned on the local map to uniformly cover free space, improving navigation success with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard trajectory samplers often use environment-agnostic control distributions p(u|x), which can waste samples in occupied regions and fail to explore free space efficiently. There is a need for a sampler that adapts to the local map to achieve uniform sampling of the free configuration space.

Method: Define Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform), a control input distribution p(u|x, map) designed to uniformly sample the free configuration space. Integrate this into a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to form CFU-MPPI, enabling planning with a locally conditioned, uniform-free-space sampling strategy.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate that CFU-MPPI achieves higher success rates than existing sampling-based methods in cluttered polygonal environments, while requiring a substantially smaller sampling budget.

Conclusion: Conditioning trajectory sampling on the local map to enforce uniform sampling of free space (C-Free-Uniform) yields more reliable and efficient navigation via CFU-MPPI, especially in cluttered environments with limited samples.

Abstract: Trajectory sampling is a key component of sampling-based control mechanisms.
Trajectory samplers rely on control input samplers, which generate control
inputs u from a distribution p(u | x) where x is the current state. We
introduce the notion of Free Configuration Space Uniformity (C-Free-Uniform for
short) which has two key features: (i) it generates a control input
distribution so as to uniformly sample the free configuration space, and (ii)
in contrast to previously introduced trajectory sampling mechanisms where the
distribution p(u | x) is independent of the environment, C-Free-Uniform is
explicitly conditioned on the current local map. Next, we integrate this
sampler into a new Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller, CFU-MPPI.
Experiments show that CFU-MPPI outperforms existing methods in terms of success
rate in challenging navigation tasks in cluttered polygonal environments while
requiring a much smaller sampling budget.

Abstract: This paper addresses the scarcity of affordable, fully-actuated five-fingered
hands for dexterous teleoperation, which is crucial for collecting large-scale
real-robot data within the "Learning from Demonstrations" paradigm. We
introduce the prototype version of the RAPID Hand, the first low-cost,
20-degree-of-actuation (DoA) dexterous hand that integrates a novel
anthropomorphic actuation and transmission scheme with an optimized motor
layout and structural design to enhance dexterity. Specifically, the RAPID Hand
features a universal phalangeal transmission scheme for the non-thumb fingers
and an omnidirectional thumb actuation mechanism. Prioritizing affordability,
the hand employs 3D-printed parts combined with custom gears for easier

*Pedram Fekri,Majid Roshanfar,Samuel Barbeau,Seyedfarzad Famouri,Thomas Looi,Dale Podolsky,Mehrdad Zadeh,Javad Dargahi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous catheter navigation via DINO-CVA: a multimodal, goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework that fuses visual data and joystick kinematics to predict actions, achieving action accuracy comparable to kinematics-only baselines while grounding predictions in anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce operator dependency in catheter-based interventions, addressing operator fatigue, radiation exposure, and variability by moving from follow-leader systems toward intelligent autonomous navigation.

Method: DINO-CVA learns a joint embedding of visual observations and kinematic data, enabling autoregressive action prediction from expert demonstrations. It uses goal conditioning to steer navigation toward specified destinations and is evaluated on a robotic setup with a synthetic vascular phantom collecting multimodal data.

Result: High accuracy in action prediction, matching a kinematics-only baseline, with added grounding in the anatomical environment.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation and represents a meaningful step toward reducing operator dependency and improving reliability of catheter-based therapies.

Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive
interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite
advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader
in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent
autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation
exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards
autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal
goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual
observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling
policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted
autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding
navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a
synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and
evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in
predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline
while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These
findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned
architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward
reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased
therapies.

### [498] [Learning to Design Soft Hands using Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17086)
*Xueqian Bai,Nicklas Hansen,Adabhav Singh,Michael T. Tolley,Yan Duan,Pieter Abbeel,Xiaolong Wang,Sha Yi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Cross-Entropy Method with Reward Model (CEM-RM) efficiently co-designs tendon-driven soft robotic hands via teleoperation data, reducing design evaluations by over 50% while learning a distribution of optimized designs; 3D-printed hands validated in simulation and hardware show superior grasping across challenging objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robotic hands offer safe, compliant manipulation but balancing high compliance with wide functional capability is hard. The high-dimensional co-design space of hardware and control makes optimization expensive, especially with simulation. Leveraging teleoperation data to guide design search can reduce evaluations and improve morphology–behavior coupling.

Method: Introduce CEM-RM to search the tendon-driven soft hand design space (flexural fingers) using a teleoperation-based control policy. Build a design space, run parallelized simulations, and learn a distribution of optimized designs from pre-collected teleoperation data. Fabricate 3D-printed hands and validate with teleoperation data both offline and in real time.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms baseline hands in grasping success across diverse objects, while reducing design evaluation cost by more than half compared with pure optimization. Realization includes simulation and hardware experiments demonstrating improved performance.

Conclusion: CEM-RM accelerates the co-design of soft robotic hands by effectively leveraging teleoperation data to guide search and learning, yielding superior grasping performance and practical viability through 3D-printed hardware; the approach holds promise for broader application to soft robot design.

Abstract: Soft robotic hands promise to provide compliant and safe interaction with
objects and environments. However, designing soft hands to be both compliant
and functional across diverse use cases remains challenging. Although co-design
of hardware and control better couples morphology to behavior, the resulting
search space is high-dimensional, and even simulation-based evaluation is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Entropy Method
with Reward Model (CEM-RM) framework that efficiently optimizes tendon-driven
soft robotic hands based on teleoperation control policy, reducing design
evaluations by more than half compared to pure optimization while learning a
distribution of optimized hand designs from pre-collected teleoperation data.
We derive a design space for a soft robotic hand composed of flexural soft
fingers and implement parallelized training in simulation. The optimized hands
are then 3D-printed and deployed in the real world using both teleoperation
data and real-time teleoperation. Experiments in both simulation and hardware
demonstrate that our optimized design significantly outperforms baseline hands
in grasping success rates across a diverse set of challenging objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A systematic survey of efficiency techniques for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, aimed at reducing latency, memory usage, and training/inference costs for edge/real-time robotics. It provides a taxonomy across four dimensions and discusses trends and open challenges for efficient embodied intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models are powerful but computationally and memory intensive, making real-time, on-board deployment on edge platforms (e.g., mobile manipulators) challenging. There is a need to systematically organize and evaluate approaches to improve efficiency.

Method: A systematic literature review that categorizes efficiency-enhancing techniques into four dimensions (model architecture, perception features, action generation, and training/inference strategies), summarizing representative techniques within each category and discussing future trends and open problems.

Result: The paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy and synthesis of existing techniques to improve VLA efficiency, highlighting effective strategies within each category and identifying gaps and directions for future work.

Conclusion: Efficient embodied intelligence is achievable with continued focus on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training/inference costs; the survey outlines key open challenges and promising directions to scale VLA systems on edge platforms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied
control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to
robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant
challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which
conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile
manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has
become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts
toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a
systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis
on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We
categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture,
perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies,
summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss
future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing
efficient embodied intelligence.

*Shantnav Agarwal,Javier Alonso-Mora,Sihao Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imitation-learning-based decentralized kinodynamic planning for multi-UAV cable-suspended loads without inter-agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on centralized control or reliable inter-agent communication; there is a need for decentralized planning under partial observability to improve scalability and robustness.

Method: Train decentralized student policies for each UAV by imitating a centralized kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The student uses physics-informed neural networks to generate smooth, dynamically consistent trajectories that respect motion derivatives. During training, the student benefits from the full trajectory produced by the teacher, improving sample efficiency; training can be completed in under two hours on a standard laptop.

Result: Validation in both simulation and real-world experiments shows the decentralized policies can follow agile reference trajectories with performance comparable to centralized approaches.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a practical, sample-efficient path to decentralized kinodynamic planning for cable-suspended multi-UAV systems without inter-agent communication, achieving performance on par with centralized methods.

Abstract: Existing approaches for transporting and manipulating cable-suspended loads
using multiple UAVs along reference trajectories typically rely on either
centralized control architectures or reliable inter-agent communication. In
this work, we propose a novel machine learning based method for decentralized
kinodynamic planning that operates effectively under partial observability and
without inter-agent communication. Our method leverages imitation learning to
train a decentralized student policy for each UAV by imitating a centralized
kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The
student policy generates smooth trajectories using physics-informed neural
networks that respect the derivative relationships in motion. During training,
the student policies utilize the full trajectory generated by the teacher
policy, leading to improved sample efficiency. Moreover, each student policy
can be trained in under two hours on a standard laptop. We validate our method
in both simulation and real-world environments to follow an agile reference
trajectory, demonstrating performance comparable to that of centralized
approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiffVLA++ integrates Vision-Language-Action reasoning with end-to-end planning via a metric-guided trajectory scorer, achieving better long-tail driving performance (EPDMS 49.12) on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E2E driving models struggle to generalize in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and reasoning about surrounding environments; VLA models possess world knowledge but suffer from limited 3D reasoning, leading to physically infeasible actions. A bridging mechanism is needed to combine their strengths.

Method: Three-part architecture: (1) a VLA module that directly generates semantically grounded driving trajectories, (2) an E2E module with a dense trajectory vocabulary to ensure physical feasibility, and (3) a metric-guided trajectory scorer that aligns and guides outputs from both modules to fuse cognitive reasoning with planning.

Result: Reported EPDMS score of 49.12 on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand Challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: Metric-guided alignment enables effective integration of cognitive VLA reasoning with end-to-end planning, leveraging complementary strengths to improve autonomous driving in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Conventional end-to-end (E2E) driving models are effective at generating
physically plausible trajectories, but often fail to generalize to long-tail
scenarios due to the lack of essential world knowledge to understand and reason
about surrounding environments. In contrast, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models leverage world knowledge to handle challenging cases, but their limited
3D reasoning capability can lead to physically infeasible actions. In this work
we introduce DiffVLA++, an enhanced autonomous driving framework that
explicitly bridges cognitive reasoning and E2E planning through metric-guided
alignment. First, we build a VLA module directly generating semantically
grounded driving trajectories. Second, we design an E2E module with a dense
trajectory vocabulary that ensures physical feasibility. Third, and most
critically, we introduce a metric-guided trajectory scorer that guides and
aligns the outputs of the VLA and E2E modules, thereby integrating their
complementary strengths. The experiment on the ICCV 2025 Autonomous Grand
Challenge leaderboard shows that DiffVLA++ achieves EPDMS of 49.12.

### [502] [OmniVIC: A Self-Improving Variable Impedance Controller with Vision-Language In-Context Learning for Safe Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17150)
*Heng Zhang,Wei-Hsing Huang,Gokhan Solak,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniVIC combines a universal variable impedance controller with a vision-language model using retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning to adapt impedance parameters for safe, generalizable contact-rich manipulation; it improves success rate from 27% to 61.4% and reduces force violations, validated in simulation and real robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICs offer safe interaction but struggle to generalize to unseen, complex, and unstructured safe interactions in universal tasks; there is a need to incorporate high-level semantic reasoning to guide low-level compliant control for broader applicability.

Method: A self-improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and In-Context Learning (ICL) framework. RAG retrieves relevant prior experiences from a memory bank to inform the controller about similar past tasks; ICL uses retrieved examples and the current task prompt to query a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate context-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation. Real-time force/torque feedback further constrains impedance for safety.

Result: The method outperforms baselines on a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and real-world robot tasks, achieving higher success rates and reduced force violations.

Conclusion: OmniVIC bridges high-level semantic reasoning and low-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable manipulation across universal task scenarios; represents a step toward universal, safe robot manipulation with improved success in contact-rich environments.

Abstract: We present OmniVIC, a universal variable impedance controller (VIC) enhanced
by a vision language model (VLM), which improves safety and adaptation in any
contact-rich robotic manipulation task to enhance safe physical interaction.
Traditional VIC have shown advantages when the robot physically interacts with
the environment, but lack generalization in unseen, complex, and unstructured
safe interactions in universal task scenarios involving contact or uncertainty.
To this end, the proposed OmniVIC interprets task context derived reasoning
from images and natural language and generates adaptive impedance parameters
for a VIC controller. Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving
Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG
retrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform
the controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved
examples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating
context-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation
scenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in
universal task scenarios. The impedance parameter regulation is further
informed by real-time force/torque feedback to ensure interaction forces remain
within safe thresholds. We demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on
a suite of complex contact-rich tasks, both in simulation and on real-world
robotic tasks, with improved success rates and reduced force violations.
OmniVIC takes a step towards bridging high-level semantic reasoning and
low-level compliant control, enabling safer and more generalizable
manipulation. Overall, the average success rate increases from 27% (baseline)
to 61.4% (OmniVIC).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in the NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge with a strong balance among safety, comfort, and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of VLM-guided fusion in end-to-end planning.

Conclusion: Shows that integrating VLM-based qualitative reasoning with traditional scoring and robust fusion improves end-to-end driving planning, positioning SimpleVSF as a leading approach in the NAVSIM v2 challenge and highlighting the value of VLMs for context-aware autonomous driving decisions.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end
methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making
in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring
Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the
cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory
fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel
VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative
aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware
decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vehicle-mounted event camera system enabling simultaneous VLC and VLP for GPS-denied self-localization, achieving sub-meter distance estimates up to 100 m and low BER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust self-localization in GPS-denied environments (e.g., tunnels) and harness event cameras' high temporal resolution and dynamic range to support high-speed, lighting-contrast scenes while leveraging VLC/VLP.

Method: Single event camera detects multiple LEDs using Walsh-Hadamard pilot codes; correlation identifies LEDs; distance to each transmitter estimated via phase-only correlation between LED pairs; enables MISO VLC and VLP simultaneously; field test on vehicle at 30 km/h.

Result: RMSE distance estimation ≤0.75 m for ranges up to 100 m; BER < 0.01 across the same range; robust real-world performance.

Conclusion: First vehicle-mounted system to fuse VLC and VLP with a single event camera; demonstrates feasibility of GPS-denied localization using LED-based positioning; promising for real-world deployment; further work could optimize scalability, robustness, and speed.

Abstract: Event cameras, featuring high temporal resolution and high dynamic range,
offer visual sensing capabilities comparable to conventional image sensors
while capturing fast-moving objects and handling scenes with extreme lighting
contrasts such as tunnel exits. Leveraging these properties, this study
proposes a novel self-localization system that integrates visible light
communication (VLC) and visible light positioning (VLP) within a single event
camera. The system enables a vehicle to estimate its position even in
GPS-denied environments, such as tunnels, by using VLC to obtain coordinate
information from LED transmitters and VLP to estimate the distance to each
transmitter.
  Multiple LEDs are installed on the transmitter side, each assigned a unique
pilot sequence based on Walsh-Hadamard codes. The event camera identifies
individual LEDs within its field of view by correlating the received signal
with these codes, allowing clear separation and recognition of each light
source. This mechanism enables simultaneous high-capacity MISO (multi-input
single-output) communication through VLC and precise distance estimation via
phase-only correlation (POC) between multiple LED pairs.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first vehicle-mounted system to
achieve simultaneous VLC and VLP functionalities using a single event camera.
Field experiments were conducted by mounting the system on a vehicle traveling
at 30 km/h (8.3 m/s). The results demonstrated robust real-world performance,
with a root mean square error (RMSE) of distance estimation within 0.75 m for
ranges up to 100 m and a bit error rate (BER) below 0.01 across the same range.

### [505] [Pole-Image: A Self-Supervised Pole-Anchored Descriptor for Long-Term LiDAR Localization and Map Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17237)
*Wuhao Xie,Kanji Tanaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Pole-Image: a pole-based anchor with surrounding 3D structure encoded as a 2D polar image to produce a discriminative, viewpoint-invariant descriptor via contrastive learning for robust SLAM and map maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term autonomy demands robust self-localization and reliable map maintenance. Conventional landmark-based SLAM trades off detectable but non-distinctive landmarks and highly distinctive but hard-to-detect ones. Leveraging easy-to-detect poles as anchors enables high-precision references and scalable data collection for learning, addressing perceptual aliasing and map changes.

Method: Detect pole-like landmarks and surrounding environment from LiDAR; represent the pole and its surrounding in a 2D polar image with the pole as the origin (Pole-Image); use pole anchors to enable automatic, large-scale positive-pair data collection; apply Contrastive Learning to obtain a viewpoint-invariant, discriminative descriptor that encodes the relative geometry between the pole and its surroundings.

Result: The Pole-Image descriptor is viewpoint-invariant and highly discriminative, overcoming perceptual aliasing and enabling robust self-localization; its high-precision encoding also supports high-sensitivity change detection, contributing to reliable map maintenance.

Conclusion: The Pole-Image approach combines anchor-based detection with descriptor learning to improve long-term autonomy by enabling robust localization and precise map maintenance through a descriptor that is both discriminative and stable across viewpoints.

Abstract: Long-term autonomy for mobile robots requires both robust self-localization
and reliable map maintenance. Conventional landmark-based methods face a
fundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low
distinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult
stable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the
challenge of descriptively identifying a unique "signature" (local point cloud)
by leveraging a detectable, high-precision "anchor" (like a pole). To solve
this, we propose a novel canonical representation, "Pole-Image," as a hybrid
method that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding
3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding
environment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image
with the pole itself as the origin. This representation leverages the pole's
nature as a high-precision reference point, explicitly encoding the "relative
geometry" between the stable pole and the variable surrounding point cloud. The
key advantage of pole landmarks is that "detection" is extremely easy. This
ease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the
automatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive
pairs). This data acquisition feasibility makes "Contrastive Learning (CL)"
applicable. By applying CL, the model learns a viewpoint-invariant and highly
discriminative descriptor. The contributions are twofold: 1) The descriptor
overcomes perceptual aliasing, enabling robust self-localization. 2) The
high-precision encoding enables high-sensitivity change detection, contributing
to map maintenance.

Motivation: Wheeled rovers are limited to traversable surfaces; legged robots offer terrain versatility but face environmental and model uncertainty. There is a need for a robust, adaptable control framework that can handle unknown terrains and uncertain robot parameters.

Method: A modular framework integrating model-based dynamic control, online model adaptation, and adaptive footstep planning. It includes state estimation for quadrupeds with and without contact sensing, runtime reconfiguration, ROS 2 integration, and open-source release.

Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robots capable of navigating extreme
and unknown environments. While wheeled rovers have dominated past missions,
their mobility is limited to traversable surfaces. Legged robots, especially
quadrupeds, can overcome these limitations by handling uneven, obstacle-rich,
and deformable terrains. However, deploying such robots in unknown conditions
is challenging due to the need for environment-specific control, which is
infeasible when terrain and robot parameters are uncertain. This work presents
a modular control framework that combines model-based dynamic control with
online model adaptation and adaptive footstep planning to address uncertainties
in both robot and terrain properties. The framework includes state estimation
for quadrupeds with and without contact sensing, supports runtime
reconfiguration, and is integrated into ROS 2 with open-source availability.
Its performance was validated on two quadruped platforms, multiple hardware
architectures, and in a volcano field test, where the robot walked over 700 m.

*Fernando Salanova,Jesús Roche,Cristian Mahuela,Eduardo Montijano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A NWN-driven framework with Transformer anomaly detection to identify spurious multi-robot plan executions, achieving high detection accuracy for inefficiencies and violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable execution of high-level missions in heterogeneous multi-robot systems requires robust detection of spurious or deviated executions of LTL-specified missions.

Method: Structured data generation via Nets-within-Nets coordinating robot actions with LTL global specifications, plus a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline; includes ablation studies on embedding/architecture.

Result: High performance: 91.3% accuracy in detecting execution inefficiencies; 88.3% for core mission violations; 66.8% for constraint-based adaptive anomalies; ablation demonstrates superiority of the proposed representation.

Conclusion: The framework effectively detects spurious executions and deviations in multi-robot missions and the embedding/architecture choice contributes to improved detection over simpler baselines.

Abstract: The reliable execution of high-level missions in multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous agents, requires robust methods for detecting spurious behaviors.
In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of
plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task
sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or
deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a
structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN)
paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission
specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection
pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi-
mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in
identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection
capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive
anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was
carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs
better than simpler representations.

*Lucas Schulze,Juliano Decico Negri,Victor Barasuol,Vivian Suzano Medeiros,Marcelo Becker,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FeLaN introduces a physics-constrained grey-box model for floating-base robots that predicts 6x6 inertia matrices with guaranteed physical properties, improving inverse dynamics accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating-base agents (humanoids/quadrupeds) have inertia structures that violate generic DL priors. Enforcing physics-informed constraints (positive definiteness, sparsity, eigenvalue relations) should improve realism, generalization, and interpretability.

Method: Parameterize inertia matrices to satisfy constraints (e.g., PD, sparsity, eigenvalue inequalities, triangle inequality). Train neural nets to predict these inertia matrices by minimizing inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics, following a DeLaN-inspired approach. Evaluate on a released dataset of multiple quadrupeds and humanoids.

Result: FeLaN achieves competitive performance on both simulated and real robots while offering greater physical interpretability and constraint satisfaction compared to unconstrained DL baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating physically consistent inertia parameterizations in grey-box models yields better generalization and interpretability for floating-base robots; the released dataset enables broader benchmarking.

Abstract: Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with
physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving
out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of
floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models
ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is
not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input
independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base
inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this
includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational
inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of
floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that
satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN),
we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that
minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we
collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these
experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly
competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing
greater physical interpretability.

*Po-Chen Ko,Jiayuan Mao,Yu-Hsiang Fu,Hsien-Jeng Yeh,Chu-Rong Chen,Wei-Chiu Ma,Yilun Du,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A video-based planning framework that online-updates from interaction-time data to handle uncertainty and failed plans, enabling implicit state estimation and improved replanning on a new simulated manipulation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video representations support planning but struggle with interaction-time uncertainties and partial observability; there is a need for online adaptation and plan-level filtering without explicit state models.

Method: Integrates interaction-time data during planning, performs online parameter updates, and filters out previously failed plans during generation to implicitly estimate state; evaluated on a new simulated manipulation benchmark.

Result: Demonstrates improved replanning performance and adaptability in the face of interaction-time failures on the simulated benchmark, advancing video-based decision-making.

Conclusion: Online integration of interaction-time data and implicit state estimation make video-based planning more robust to uncertainties without explicit unknown-state modeling.

Abstract: Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and
decision-making due to their ability to encode rich spatiotemporal dynamics and
geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and
generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and
navigation. However, existing video planning frameworks often struggle to adapt
to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about
uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time
data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online
and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables
implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without
explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through
extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating
its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of
video-based decision-making.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable digging robot (DDBot) with a GPU-accelerated differentiable simulator enables fast identification of unknown granular dynamics and high-precision digging with zero-shot real-world deployment, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Granular material manipulation is hard due to complex contact dynamics and unknown properties; existing methods struggle to be both efficient and accurate for small-scale, high-precision tasks.

Method: A differentiable physics-based simulator for granular materials on GPU, with differentiable skill-to-action mapping, task-oriented demonstrations, gradient clipping, and line-search-based gradient descent for differentiable system identification and skill optimization.

Result: DDBot converges to identify unknown granular dynamics within 5–20 minutes and achieves high-precision digging in zero-shot real-world deployments; benchmark results show robustness and efficiency against state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The differentiable framework enables practical, robust, and efficient manipulation of granular materials with unknown properties, enabling reliable real-world deployment for precision digging tasks.

Abstract: Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant
challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties,
and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve
efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper
studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with
unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging
robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and
soil.
  Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator,
tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated
parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient
differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill
optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a
differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method,
gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.
  Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20
minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging
skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments,
highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art
baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging
tasks.

### [511] [Interactive Force-Impedance Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17341)
*Fan Shao,Satoshi Endo,Sandra Hirche,Fanny Ficuciello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified Interactive Force-Impedance Control (IFIC) framework is proposed, using a port-Hamiltonian structure to guarantee passivity and safe, effortless interaction in contact-rich human-robot collaboration by adapting to interaction power flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible human-robot collaboration requires reliable role adaptation (leader/follower) and safe interaction. Existing methods rely on sparse-contact assumptions and can lose passivity under active human interaction or non-passive environments, posing safety risks.

Method: Develop IFIC within a port-Hamiltonian framework with both interaction and task ports. The controller adapts to the interaction power flow to preserve passivity and ensure safe, energy-based stability during contact-rich interactions.

Result: The framework guarantees passivity and safe interaction in contact-rich environments, addressing safety concerns during human-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: The IFIC framework provides a passivity-guaranteed, energy-based control approach for seamless leader-follower role switching in human-robot teams by unifying force and impedance control under port-Hamiltonian formulation.

Abstract: Human collaboration with robots requires flexible role adaptation, enabling
robot to switch between active leader and passive follower. Effective role
switching depends on accurately estimating human intention, which is typically
achieved through external force analysis, nominal robot dynamics, or
data-driven approaches. However, these methods are primarily effective in
contact-sparse environments. When robots under hybrid or unified
force-impedance control physically interact with active humans or non-passive
environments, the robotic system may lose passivity and thus compromise safety.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes the unified Interactive
Force-Impedance Control (IFIC) framework that adapts to the interaction power
flow, ensuring effortless and safe interaction in contact-rich environments.
The proposed control architecture is formulated within a port-Hamiltonian
framework, incorporating both interaction and task control ports, through which
system passivity is guaranteed.

*Haochen Su,Cristian Meo,Francesco Stella,Andrea Peirone,Kai Junge,Josie Hughes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Out-of-the-box Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies fail when deployed on a soft continuum robot due to embodiment mismatch, but targeted finetuning enables the VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and π0) to perform on par with rigid manipulators, demonstrating safe and adaptable embodied AI in human-shared environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend VLA-guided control from rigid, serial-link manipulators to soft robots operating in human-centered, unstructured environments, addressing safety, adaptability, and generalization through embodied alignment.

Method: A structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and π0) on a soft continuum manipulator across representative manipulation tasks; compare out-of-the-box policies versus finetuned policies to assess embodiment gap bridging.

Result: Out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch; targeted finetuning enables the soft robot to achieve performance equal to the rigid counterpart, highlighting the need for embodiment-aware adaptation when deploying VLA models on soft systems.

Conclusion: Finetuning to bridge embodiment gaps is essential for safe and flexible embodied AI; coupling VLA models with soft robots expands the applicability of language-guided control in human-shared environments.

Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered,
unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are
essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language
guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment
has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their
rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely
interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present
the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate
autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and
deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and
$\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while
out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted
finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our
findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps,
and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and
flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.

*Zhengshen Zhang,Hao Li,Yalun Dai,Zhengbang Zhu,Lei Zhou,Chenchen Liu,Dong Wang,Francis E. H. Tay,Sijin Chen,Ziwei Liu,Yuxiao Liu,Xinghang Li,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FALCON introduces 3D spatial tokens into the action head for vision-language-action models, using spatial foundation models to inject geometric priors from RGB and an optional Embodied Spatial Model for depth/pose fusion, while keeping language reasoning intact. It achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple simulation and real-world tasks, showing robustness to clutter and scale/height variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models operate in 3D but rely on 2D encoders, creating a spatial reasoning gap that hurts generalization and adaptability. Existing 3D integration methods either require specialized sensors or offer weak cues that degrade VL alignment. A need exists for a plug-in, geometry-aware 3D representation that preserves language reasoning and is transferable across modalities.

Method: FALCON injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head (not the backbone). It leverages spatial foundation models to provide geometric priors from RGB data. An Embodied Spatial Model can optionally fuse depth and pose when available, without retraining or architectural changes. Spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head to preserve language reasoning.

Result: Across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing competitive baselines and showing robustness under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.

Conclusion: FALCON addresses limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment for VLA systems by introducing 3D spatial tokens into the action head and leveraging geometry-aware priors from RGB, with optional depth/pose fusion, achieving strong generalization across diverse tasks without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are
typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits
generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs
either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or
inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In
this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that
injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial
foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and
includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for
higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To
preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced
Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.
These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation,
modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across
three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive
baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and
variations in object scale and height.

*Mirko Mizzoni,Pieter van Goor,Barbara Bazzana,Antonio Franchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A formal switching framework for feedback-linearizable outputs using melds, with dwell-time and compatibility guarantees that preserve uniform boundedness and exponential stability, enabling seamless transitions between output sets for nonlinear control; applicable to general systems and demonstrated on a robotic manipulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Switching among multiple output sets in nonlinear control poses stability challenges across switches. There is a need for a formal construct that defines valid, feedback-linearizable subsets (melds) and guarantees stability when switching among them.

Method: Define the meld concept to specify valid, feedback-linearizable output subsets. Prove that with appropriate dwell-time and compatibility conditions, switching between melds preserves uniform boundedness of the state. Prove the error dynamics of active outputs are exponentially stable within each interval, and that outputs common to consecutive melds are tracked during transitions. Present a theory applicable to any feedback-linearizable nonlinear system; illustrate with a numerical simulation on a robotic manipulator.

Result: The study provides rigorous stability and boundedness guarantees for switching melds in feedback-linearizable nonlinear systems, including exponential stability of error dynamics within switching intervals and seamless tracking of shared outputs at transitions. The framework is general and demonstrated via a simple robotic manipulator simulation.

Conclusion: The paper offers a general, rigorous framework for switching between different melds of outputs in feedback-linearizable nonlinear systems, ensuring stability and boundedness, with broad applicability to robotics and vehicle systems and validated through simulation.

Abstract: This letter presents a systematic framework for switching between different
sets of outputs for the control of nonlinear systems via feedback
linearization. We introduce the concept of a meld to formally define a valid,
feedback-linearizable subset of outputs that can be selected from a larger deck
of possible outputs. The main contribution is a formal proof establishing that
under suitable dwell-time and compatibility conditions, it is possible to
switch between different melds while guaranteeing the uniform boundedness of
the system state. We further show that the error dynamics of the active outputs
remain exponentially stable within each switching interval and that outputs
common to consecutive melds are tracked seamlessly through transitions. The
proposed theory is valid for any feedback linearizable nonlinear system, such
as, e.g., robots, aerial and terrestrial vehicles, etc.. We demonstrate it on a
simple numerical simulation of a robotic manipulator.

*Simon Schaefer,Helen Oleynikova,Sandra Hirche,Stefan Leutenegger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces HumanMPC, a 3D MAV MPC framework for navigating among humans that combines reachability-based safety with data-driven human motion forecasting, achieving safe yet efficient navigation; validated in simulation and real-world, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe, efficient navigation around humans in 3D spaces is essential for real-world robot deployment. Existing approaches often simplify to 2D and ignore full body dynamics, leading to unsafe or overly conservative behavior. A framework that merges theoretical safety with realistic human motion forecasting is needed and valuable for broader platforms.

Method: Propose HumanMPC: an MPC-based planner that uses data-driven models to forecast 3D human motion and introduces a twist to reachability-based safety: the safety constraint is applied to the initial control input, while its effect is propagated over the entire planning horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. Validated on MAVs with real human trajectories and real-world experiments; claims generic applicability to other platforms.

Result: Simulation with real human trajectories and real-world experiments show the method is effective for tasks from goal-directed navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. It achieves safety without excessive conservatism and outperforms baseline approaches in both efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: The approach is generic and can be adapted to other platforms beyond MAVs; it provides a safety framework that is less conservative while ensuring reliable navigation in human-rich environments.

Abstract: Safe and efficient robotic navigation among humans is essential for
integrating robots into everyday environments. Most existing approaches focus
on simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity
of human body dynamics beyond root motion. We present HumanMPC, a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for 3D Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) navigation
among humans that combines theoretical safety guarantees with data-driven
models for realistic human motion forecasting. Our approach introduces a novel
twist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial
control input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning
horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both
simulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world,
demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed
navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to
MAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms. Our
results show that the method ensures safety without excessive conservatism and
outperforms baseline approaches in both efficiency and reliability.

*Xiaobo Zheng,Pan Tang,Defu Lin,Shaoming He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Distributed Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP): a two-level, fully distributed swarm trajectory optimization framework that combines ADMM for consensus with Parameterized DDP (PDDP) for fast local planning, and uses an adaptive penalty parameter (spectral gradient) to speed convergence, demonstrated on UAV swarms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, nonlinear swarm trajectory optimization is hindered by pre-setting final time and high iteration counts; existing methods struggle with scalability and distributed implementation for UAV swarms. A distributed, fast-planning approach is needed.

Method: Two-level architecture: (1) Parameterized DDP (PDDP) serves as the local trajectory optimizer for each UAV; (2) ADMM enforces local constraints and achieves spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all UAVs. The framework yields a distributed algorithm (D-PDDP). An adaptive penalty parameter tuning criterion based on the spectral gradient method is included to reduce iterations.

Result: Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating improved efficiency and scalability in coordinating large UAV swarms and achieving consensus.

Conclusion: The proposed D-PDDP framework provides a fully distributed, scalable solution for swarm trajectory optimization, enabling fast local planning with ADMM-based consensus and adaptive penalty tuning to reduce iterations; suitable for large-scale UAV deployments.

Abstract: Swarm trajectory optimization problems are a well-recognized class of
multi-agent optimal control problems with strong nonlinearity. However, the
heuristic nature of needing to set the final time for agents beforehand and the
time-consuming limitation of the significant number of iterations prohibit the
application of existing methods to large-scale swarm of Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) in practice. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal
trajectory optimization framework that accomplishes multi-UAV consensus based
on the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) and uses Differential
Dynamic Programming (DDP) for fast local planning of individual UAVs. The
introduced framework is a two-level architecture that employs Parameterized DDP
(PDDP) as the trajectory optimizer for each UAV, and ADMM to satisfy the local
constraints and accomplish the spatial-temporal parameter consensus among all
UAVs. This results in a fully distributed algorithm called Distributed
Parameterized DDP (D-PDDP). In addition, an adaptive tuning criterion based on
the spectral gradient method for the penalty parameter is proposed to reduce
the number of algorithmic iterations. Several simulation examples are presented
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A perception-to-text and LLM-based ensemble planning pipeline with verifier and a consistency filter enables robust, intent-driven multi-robot task sequences; demonstrated on EV-battery dismantling in unstructured scenes with real-world evaluation and human-in-the-loop testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planing complex manipulations with multiple robots in unstructured environments is hard due to heterogeneous end-effectors, varied objects, and the need to interpret operator intent as executable sequences. The work seeks to bridge natural-language guidance with safe, feasible multi-robot actions.

Method: Proposed pipeline: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding; (ii) an ensemble of large language models that generate candidate removal sequences from operator intent; (iii) an LLM-based verifier enforcing formatting and precedence constraints; (iv) a deterministic consistency filter to reject hallucinated objects. Evaluated on a task where two robot arms dismantle an EV battery, with 200 real scenes and 600 operator prompts across five component classes; comparisons include five LLM-based planners and ablations; also includes evaluation of the LLM-based human interface (time-to-execution, NASA TLX) with human participants.

Result: The ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort. The study includes ablation analyses and comparisons among planners, and reports favorable metrics on full-sequence and next-task correctness, as well as positive human-interface evaluations.

Conclusion: An ensemble-with-verification planning pipeline can robustly translate natural-language operator intent into safe, executable multi-robot plans in unstructured settings, reducing user burden and enabling scalable collaboration across heterogeneous robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in
which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed
by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on
a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations
in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can
robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory
input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates:
(i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language
models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's
intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence
constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects
hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two
robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for
recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in
specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order
feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with
600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of
full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare
five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components).
We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution
and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our
ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe,
executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust, low-cost bicycle localization that handles GNSS multipath and reduces TLIO cost for mobile deployment.

Method: Extend TLIO to bicycles and replace the displacement predictor with an improved Mixture-of-Experts model to lower training and inference costs; evaluate against LLIO.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to LLIO; parameters reduced by 64.7%; computational cost reduced by 81.8%.

Conclusion: MoE-enhanced TLIO enables efficient bicycle localization suitable for mobile devices without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of bike sharing and the increasing diversity of cycling
applications, accurate bicycle localization has become essential. traditional
GNSS-based methods suffer from multipath effects, while existing inertial
navigation approaches rely on precise modeling and show limited robustness.
Tight Learned Inertial Odometry (TLIO) achieves low position drift by combining
raw IMU data with predicted displacements by neural networks, but its high
computational cost restricts deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this, we
extend TLIO to bicycle localization and introduce an improved Mixture-of
Experts (MoE) model that reduces both training and inference costs. Experiments
show that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLIO framework, our method achieves
comparable accuracy while reducing parameters by 64.7% and computational cost
by 81.8%.

Motivation: Imitation datasets lack failure or recovery trajectories; VLA models struggle when states deviate from training distribution due to perturbations; need mechanisms to learn recovery from OOD states.

Method: Train an action-value network via offline RL to identify sub-optimal actions under current policy; rollout to sample potential OOD states; adaptive exploratory sampling to insert action proxies into training data; train VLA with augmented data emphasizing recovery.

Result: On LIBERO and real-world tasks, RESample improves stability and generalization of VLA models under distributional shifts.

Conclusion: RESample provides an effective OOD data augmentation framework that enhances robustness of vision-language-action models for robotic manipulation, with potential applicability to broader settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However,
existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and
lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states
where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or
errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training
distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation
framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first
leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that
accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation
policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout,
and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these
action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently,
our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and
enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive
experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation
tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and
generalization ability of VLA models.

*Simeon Adebola,Chung Min Kim,Justin Kerr,Shuangyu Xie,Prithvi Akella,Jose Luis Susa Rincon,Eugen Solowjow,Ken Goldberg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Botany-Bot is a hardware-software system for creating annotated digital twins of living plants, using stereo cameras, a turntable, a robot arm, and 3D Gaussian Splat models to overcome leaf occlusion and enable high-detail imaging; it demonstrates high accuracy in segmentation and manipulation, and provides open-source data and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial plant phenotyping with fixed cameras misses occluded details; to build detailed digital twins requires active perception and controllable imaging of occluded leaf regions.

Method: Integrates two stereo cameras, a digital turntable, industrial robot arm, and 3D segmentated Gaussian Splat models; develops robot manipulation algorithms to lift/push leaves for exposing occluded regions; captures high-resolution indexable images of underside/topside and stem buds; produces annotated digital twins.

Result: Segmentation accuracy 90.8%, leaf detection 86.2%, lift/push accuracy 77.9%, detailed overside/underside imaging 77.3%; dataset/code available at provided URL.

Conclusion: Botany-Bot demonstrates a practical approach to detailed plant phenotyping by addressing occlusion and enabling high-resolution imaging, with accessible resources for the community.

Abstract: Commercial plant phenotyping systems using fixed cameras cannot perceive many
plant details due to leaf occlusion. In this paper, we present Botany-Bot, a
system for building detailed "annotated digital twins" of living plants using
two stereo cameras, a digital turntable inside a lightbox, an industrial robot
arm, and 3D segmentated Gaussian Splat models. We also present robot algorithms
for manipulating leaves to take high-resolution indexable images of occluded
details such as stem buds and the underside/topside of leaves. Results from
experiments suggest that Botany-Bot can segment leaves with 90.8% accuracy,
detect leaves with 86.2% accuracy, lift/push leaves with 77.9% accuracy, and
take detailed overside/underside images with 77.3% accuracy. Code, videos, and
datasets are available at https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/Botany-Bot/.

### [522] [SoftMimic: Learning Compliant Whole-body Control from Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17792)
*Gabriel B. Margolis,Michelle Wang,Nolan Fey,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoftMimic learns compliant whole-body control for humanoids from an example motion clip by using an IK-generated augmented dataset to train an RL policy that emphasizes compliant responses over rigid tracking, enabling disturbance absorption and safer interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imitation learning for humanoid control often yields stiff policies that aggressively correct deviations, causing brittle and unsafe behavior under unexpected contacts. There is a need for compliant, robust responses that maintain balance while interacting with the environment.

Method: Generate a dataset of compliant motions by solving an inverse kinematics (IK) problem to augment a reference motion. Train a reinforcement learning policy to imitate these compliant responses rather than exact motion tracking, encouraging absorption of disturbances. The approach aims to generalize from a single motion clip to varied tasks.

Result: Validated in simulations and real-world experiments, the method demonstrates safe, effective interaction with the environment and the ability to absorb disturbances.

Conclusion: SoftMimic provides a pathway to compliant, robust whole-body humanoid control learned from a single motion, reducing brittleness of prior imitation-learning approaches and enabling safer interaction with dynamic environments.

Abstract: We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control
policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with
reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but
existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects
deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when
the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots
to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and
posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an
augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a
reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant
responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns
to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion
clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboBench benchmarks multimodal LLMs as embodied brains across five cognitive dimensions, 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs; uses a world-simulated evaluation to test planning feasibility; reveals major gaps in current models that impede high-level cognitive abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks either focus on execution success or high-level reasoning with incomplete coverage and limited realism. There is a need to systematically evaluate the embodied brain's cognitive capabilities across perception, reasoning, planning, and failure analysis in realistic manipulation tasks.

Method: Define five evaluation dimensions (instruction comprehension, perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, failure analysis) across 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. Curate datasets from diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects, and multi-view scenes using large-scale real robotic data. Introduce MLLM-as-world-simulator to evaluate whether predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes, i.e., embodied feasibility.

Result: Experiments on 14 MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis.

Conclusion: RoboBench provides a comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition in embodied MLLMs and guide the development of next-generation embodied agents; the project page is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Building robots that can perceive, reason, and act in dynamic, unstructured
environments remains a core challenge. Recent embodied systems often adopt a
dual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System
1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the
embodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and
decision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation
of the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution
success, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete
dimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of
cognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark
that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as
embodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation
pipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,
perception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure
analysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure
realism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,
and multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For
planning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,
MLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether
predicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14
MLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction
comprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained
affordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a
comprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the
development of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in

### [524] [Ellipsoidal Filtration for Topological Denoising of Recurrent Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16682)
*Omer Bahadir Eryilmaz,Cihan Katar,Max A. Little*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Ellipsoidal filtration uses orientation-aware, gradient-aligned ellipsoids for persistent homology to denoise recurrent signals, outperforming standard Rips-based methods, especially for low-amplitude components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Rips filtrations rely on isotropic neighborhoods and ignore the direction of signal evolution, which can limit denoising performance; a method that captures trajectory flow could improve noise reduction.

Method: Construct ellipsoids aligned with local gradients to capture trajectory flow in the data. The death scale of the most persistent H1 feature defines a data-driven neighborhood used for averaging. Applied to synthetic recurrent signals and compared against topological and moving-average filters.

Result: The proposed method achieves better noise reduction than both topological and moving-average filters, with particular gains for low-amplitude components.

Conclusion: Ellipsoidal filtration effectively encodes directional evolution in persistent homology, enabling improved denoising and suggesting broader applicability to dynamical data analysis.

Abstract: We introduce ellipsoidal filtration, a novel method for persistent homology,
and demonstrate its effectiveness in denoising recurrent signals. Unlike
standard Rips filtrations, which use isotropic neighbourhoods and ignore the
signal's direction of evolution, our approach constructs ellipsoids aligned
with local gradients to capture trajectory flow. The death scale of the most
persistent H_1 feature defines a data-driven neighbourhood for averaging.
Experiments on synthetic signals show that our method achieves better noise
reduction than both topological and moving-average filters, especially for
low-amplitude components.

### [525] [Flow-Aware Ellipsoidal Filtration for Persistent Homology of Recurrent Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17735)
*Omer Bahadir Eryilmaz,Cihan Katar,Max A. Little*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Ellipsoidal filtration for persistent homology uses anisotropic ellipsoids guided by local flow variances to model dynamical point clouds, improving denoising and recurrence-time estimation; H1 persistence provides a data-driven threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of isotropic filtrations (e.g., Vietoris-Rips) for point clouds assumed to come from dynamic flows by incorporating directional, flow-based scale variation.

Method: Construct ellipsoidal neighborhoods around points using estimated local flow variances; increase scale by enlarging ellipsoids; build a filtration and compute persistent homology (focus on H1); select the ellipsoids according to the maximum persistence of H1 to set a data-driven denoising and recurrence-time threshold.

Result: Ellipsoidal neighborhoods yield better denoising of recurrent signals and more accurate recurrence-time estimates, especially when data contain bottlenecks; the H1-persistence-based threshold improves robustness.

Conclusion: Ellipsoidal filtration is a promising, flow-aware alternative to isotropic filtrations for dynamical point clouds, offering improved denoising and timing estimates with a principled, data-driven threshold derived from H1 persistence.

Abstract: One common use of persistent homology is to explore the shape of point
clouds, where points are assumed to be sampled from a geometric object. We
propose a novel filtration, called ellipsoidal filtration, which assumes that
point clouds are sampled from a dynamic smooth flow. Instead of creating
topologies from point clouds at increasing scales using isotropic balls (for
example, Vietoris-Rips filtration), ellipsoidal filtration creates ellipsoids
around points based on local flow variances, approximating the flow's manifold
as the scale increases. We show that constructing ellipsoidal neighbourhoods
improves the denoising of recurrent signals and the estimation of recurrence
times, especially when the data contain bottlenecks. Choosing ellipsoids
according to the maximum persistence of the H1 class provides a data-driven
threshold for both denoising and recurrence-time estimation.

### [526] [Who Needs Crossings?: Noncrossing Linkages are Universal, and Deciding (Global) Rigidity is Hard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17737)
*Zachary Abel,Erik D. Demaine,Martin L. Demaine,Sarah Eisenstat,Jayson Lynch,Tao B. Schardl*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Fully classifies the complexity of graph realization, rigidity, and global rigidity across three graph families (globally noncrossing, matchstick, unrestricted with unit edges or {1,2} for global rigidity). All nine problems are complete for existsR or its complement forallR, with unit-distance realization previously known to be existsR-complete and matchstick realization now shown existsR-complete. Global rigidity with {1,2} edge lengths is forallR-complete. Develops a Kempe-universality-style result for globally noncrossing linkages: any polynomial curve can be traced, and the traced regions are exactly the compact semialgebraic regions (plus the plane), preserving drawing power under noncrossing constraints. Analogous results hold for matchstick and unit-distance linkages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolve a broad set of open questions at the intersection of computational geometry and real algebraic geometry: (i) the complexity of realizing graphs with unit edges and their rigidity properties under various crossing constraints; (ii) whether certain problems lie in NP or beyond (existsR) or in their universal counterparts (forallR); (iii) whether noncrossing restrictions reduce or preserve the drawing power of linkages, via a universality-like theorem.

Method: Construct reductions from the Existential Theory of the Reals to nine geometric problems across three graph models; develop noncrossing linkage gadgets to simulate algebraic curves; prove existence of completions witnessing that polynomial curves can be traced by noncrossing linkages; classify the regions traceable by noncrossing and unit-distance/linkage devices as precisely compact semialgebraic sets (and the entire plane); extend these universality results to the matchstick and unit-distance linkage settings.

Result: Nine decision problems (realization/rigidity/global rigidity) across glob. noncrossing, matchstick, and unrestricted unit-length graphs are complete for existsR or its complement forallR; unit-distance realization is existsR-complete (Schaefer 2013); matchstick realization is existsR-complete (membership in NP remains open prior to this work); global rigidity with edge lengths in {1,2} is forallR-complete; universality theorem for globally noncrossing linkages shows any polynomial curve can be traced and the traceable regions are exactly compact semialgebraic sets (plus the plane); analogous results hold for matchstick and unit-distance linkages.

Conclusion: The complexity landscape of graph realization and rigidity is comprehensively mapped for three graph families, revealing that noncrossing constraints do not diminish drawing power in a universality sense and that all nine problems share the same existential/universal complexity characterizations. This resolves several open questions, strengthens prior results, and provides a unified framework tying geometric constructibility to the existential theory of the reals across multiple linkage and edge-length regimes.

Abstract: We exactly settle the complexity of graph realization, graph rigidity, and
graph global rigidity as applied to three types of graphs: "globally
noncrossing" graphs, which avoid crossings in all of their configurations;
matchstick graphs, with unit-length edges and where only noncrossing
configurations are considered; and unrestricted graphs (crossings allowed) with
unit edge lengths (or in the global rigidity case, edge lengths in $\{1,2\}$).
We show that all nine of these questions are complete for the class
$\exists\mathbb{R}$, defined by the Existential Theory of the Reals, or its
complement $\forall\mathbb{R}$; in particular, each problem is (co)NP-hard.
  One of these nine results--that realization of unit-distance graphs is
$\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete--was shown previously by Schaefer (2013), but the
other eight are new. We strengthen several prior results. Matchstick graph
realization was known to be NP-hard (Eades \& Wormald 1990, or Cabello et al.\
2007), but its membership in NP remained open; we show it is complete for the
(possibly) larger class $\exists\mathbb{R}$. Global rigidity of graphs with
edge lengths in $\{1,2\}$ was known to be coNP-hard (Saxe 1979); we show it is
$\forall\mathbb{R}$-complete.
  The majority of the paper is devoted to proving an analog of Kempe's
Universality Theorem--informally, "there is a linkage to sign your name"--for
globally noncrossing linkages. In particular, we show that any polynomial curve
$\phi(x,y)=0$ can be traced by a noncrossing linkage, settling an open problem
from 2004. More generally, we show that the regions in the plane that may be
traced by a noncrossing linkage are precisely the compact semialgebraic regions
(plus the trivial case of the entire plane). Thus, no drawing power is lost by
restricting to noncrossing linkages. We prove analogous results for matchstick
linkages and unit-distance linkages as well.
