*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 5M-parameter TinyViT distilled from a large ViT and trained with 5-shot prototypical loss detects early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with ~91% accuracy and AUC ≥ 0.95 on a multi-site dataset; includes Grad-CAM explainability and outperforms 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early Batten disease MRI signs are subtle and easy to miss; there is a need for data-efficient, deployable AI to aid early diagnosis.

Method: Distill a large teacher ViT into a 5M-parameter TinyViT; fine-tune with metric-based few-shot learning using prototypical loss on 5-shot episodes; evaluate on a multi-site dataset (79 Batten MRIs across CLN3/CLN2 and early CLN2 cases plus 90 age-matched controls); apply Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: Accuracy ≈ 91% and AUC ≥ 0.95; sensitivity > 90%; specificity ≈ 90%; outperforms a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baselines.

Conclusion: TinyViT-Batten demonstrates a practical, explainable AI solution for early Batten disease detection with strong performance and low computational footprint.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

*Ranjan Sapkota,Manoj Karkee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive review of Ultralytics YOLO family from YOLOv5 to YOLOv26, detailing architectural evolution, benchmarks on COCO, deployment considerations, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize rapid YOLO developments, assess performance-accuracy trade-offs, and guide deployment in real-world applications while highlighting open questions.

Method: Literature synthesis of YOLO releases; quantitative benchmarking on MS COCO for YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLO11, YOLO26; cross-version and cross-model comparisons against YOLO12, YOLO13, RT-DETR, DEIM; analysis of metrics (precision, recall, F1, mAP, speed), deployment aspects (export formats, quantization), and application domains; identification of gaps and future directions.

Conclusion: YOLO family continues to evolve towards higher efficiency and deployment readiness, but faces open challenges in dense scenes, cross-modal/open vocabulary detection, and efficient training on edge devices; future work should focus on hybrid architectures, better label assignment, and robust edge inference.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only
Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution,
benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins
with the most recent release, YOLO26 (YOLOv26), which introduces key
innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free
inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label

is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and
efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection
head and anchor-free predictions; and YOLOv5, which established the modular
PyTorch foundation that enabled modern YOLO development. Benchmarking on the MS
COCO dataset provides a detailed quantitative comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLO11, and YOLO26, alongside cross-comparisons with YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR,
and DEIM. Metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average
Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between
accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further
discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use
in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper
identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations,
hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware
training approaches.

### [3] [TreeNet: Layered Decision Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09654)
*Zeshan Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeNet is a layered ensemble method that merges neural-network features, ensemble learning, and tree-based decisions for medical image analysis, achieving strong F1-scores and real-time capability, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis often faces limited data availability and uncertain confidence in labels; there is a need for accurate, interpretable, and fast models that perform well even with smaller datasets.

Method: A novel layered decision ensemble (TreeNet) that integrates key features from neural networks, ensemble methods, and tree-based models to deliver improved performance and interpretability for medical image tasks, with emphasis on real-time analysis.

Result: F1-score reaches up to 0.85 with full training data; 0.77 with 50% data (drop of 0.08). Real-time capability shown at 32 frames per second; training time reduced with reduced data.

Conclusion: TreeNet is efficient and applicable to real-time medical image analysis and offers interpretability, with potential adaptability across diverse and complex ML tasks.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniSAT introduces a compact, transferable action tokenizer that uses B-spline encoding and multi-stage residual quantization to compress action representations for AR VLA models, achieving 6.8x sequence shortening while preserving reconstruction and enabling faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR-based VLA models are more scalable for pretraining than diffusion models, but long, high-dimensional action sequences hinder efficiency. Prior entropy-guided compression often failed due to poor reconstruction or inefficiency, motivating a robust tokenization approach.

Method: Normalize value ranges and horizons; apply B-spline encoding; perform multi-stage residual quantization on position, rotation, and gripper subspaces to produce discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity. Pre-train on Droid dataset. Develop cross-embodiment learning to leverage robot and human demonstrations, enabling auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos.

Result: Discrete tokenization achieves a 6.8× reduction in training sequence length and lowers target entropy. OmniSAT preserves reconstruction quality while enabling faster AR training convergence and improved model performance across diverse robot and simulation experiments.

Conclusion: OmniSAT provides higher compression without compromising reconstruction, and its cross-embodiment learning broadens supervision, contributing to faster and more scalable AR training for VLA tasks.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided, multi-task Mamba framework (KAMamba) with a transition-matrix loss and SDMamba backbone improves MODIS time-series change detection and LULC classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS time-series change detection is hindered by mixed pixels, spatio-spectral-temporal information coupling, and background heterogeneity. Incorporating knowledge about class transitions via a transition-matrix-guided approach can guide learning and improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: Introduce KAMamba with: (1) knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided KAT-loss to leverage class-transition knowledge; (2) multi-task learning with PreC-loss, PostC-loss, and Chg-loss to constrain learning; (3) spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules to disentangle information; (4) sparse and deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone to improve efficiency.

Result: On the MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, the method achieves 1.5–6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge-aware, multi-task Mamba framework improves MODIS change detection and LULC classification by leveraging transition knowledge and disentangled representations, while also enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid NN-UNet and diffusion model for brain tumor MRI segmentation that refines NN-UNet masks via diffusion-based residual modeling, improving Dice and Hausdorff metrics on BraTS 2021.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address generalization, boundary precision, and data diversity limitations in CNN-based brain tumor segmentation; improve segmentation quality and robustness across MRI modalities.

Method: Combine NN-UNet as the deterministic segmentation backbone with a diffusion probabilistic model that learns the residual error between predicted masks and ground-truth masks. The diffusion model iteratively denoises and refines the NN-UNet output to correct fine structural details and tumor boundaries, enhancing cross-modality robustness. Evaluated on BraTS 2021 against U-Net and transformer baselines.

Result: Outperforms conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, with improved Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. Demonstrates robustness across MRI modalities and tumor subregions.

Conclusion: Integrating deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models is a promising direction for automated brain tumor analysis, advancing state-of-the-art performance by refining boundary precision and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

### [7] [Adaptive Fusion Network with Temporal-Ranked and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Images for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09730)
*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-representation MER framework using Temporal-ranked Dynamic Image and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Image fused by an Adaptive Fusion Network, achieving state-of-the-art results on CASME-II and strong performance on SAMM and MMEW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are extremely subtle and transient, making robust representation and fusion essential to improve recognition accuracy and generalization across datasets.

Method: Introduce two complementary representations: Temporal-ranked Dynamic Image (TRDI) emphasizing temporal progression and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Image (MIDI) highlighting subtle motions via a frame-reordering mechanism that incorporates motion intensity; develop an Adaptive Fusion Network (AFN) that automatically learns to integrate TRDI and MIDI for improved ME features and noise suppression.

Result: Experiments on CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW show: CASME-II 93.95% accuracy and 0.897 UF1 (state-of-the-art); SAMM 82.47% accuracy and 0.665 UF1 (more balanced across classes); MMEW 76.00% accuracy, demonstrating generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: The combination of complementary ME representations and adaptive fusion enhances discriminative power and robustness, providing a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in affective computing, lie detection, and HCI.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

*Muhammad Munsif,Waqas Ahmad,Amjid Ali,Mohib Ullah,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An integrated MVMC CVS survey that unifies tracking, Re-ID, and action understanding (AU); introduces a four-part taxonomy; consolidates datasets, methods, results, and metrics; and outlines open challenges and future directions including privacy and lifelong learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the research gap where multi-view, multi-camera data are treated in isolation and to enable a cohesive, robust CVS framework for real-world, dynamic environments.

Method: Systematic literature review, taxonomy construction, and synthesis of datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics for MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and their integration; critical discussion of challenges and opportunities.

Result: Proposes a unified MVMC CVS framework with a four-part taxonomy (MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, combined methods); provides a structured survey of datasets, methods, results, and metrics; identifies open research questions and emerging technologies; outlines future directions.

Conclusion: A comprehensive guide for advancing CVS robustness, efficiency, and adaptability in complex real-world settings, emphasizing lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning as key future directions.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp uses cross-attention-guided rectilinear warping to allocate higher resolution to query-relevant content in images for multimodal LLMs, improving fine-grained grounding and reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, causing errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding.

Method: At test time, AttWarp applies a rectilinear warp to the input image guided by the model's cross-modal attention, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important; this preserves all original information and context, and does not modify model weights or architecture. The approach is evaluated across multiple LLMs and benchmarks.

Result: Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four LLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, InstructBLIP), AttWarp yields consistent accuracy gains, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming baselines that modify raw images at test time.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping is an effective, plug-in test-time technique that prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving global context, enabling MLLMs to read small objects and subtle relations more accurately without retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

### [10] [Towards Understanding Ambiguity Resolution in Multimodal Inference of Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09815)
*Yufei Wang,Adriana Kovashka,Loretta Fernández,Marc N. Coutanche,Seth Wiener*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study of multimodal word learning where meanings are inferred from image-text pairs; finds limited strong predictive features for success and suggests improving AI reasoning about participant performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual and textual context aids vocabulary inference in foreign language learning and to identify predictive cues of learner success and to assess AI's ability to model/reason about such human performance.

Method: Experimental study with human participants using multiple image-text pairs, with masked or unfamiliar words; analysis of data features in images and texts and their correlation with learner success; examination of language backgrounds; evaluation of AI systems' ability to reason about participant performance.

Result: Only some intuitive features show strong correlations with performance; many predictive features remain unidentified, indicating a need for further investigation; AI systems show potential in reasoning about human performance but require improvements.

Conclusion: There is a need to identify robust predictive features for success in multimodal word learning tasks and to advance AI reasoning capabilities to better model and support human learning in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

### [11] [Task-Aware Resolution Optimization for Visual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09822)
*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Empirically determine the optimal image resolution for vision-language tasks by combining image complexity and model uncertainty, and provide a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method to extend VLLMs to that resolution; validated across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLLMs typically fix input resolution, which can degrade performance on real-world data with varying perceptual granularity. There is a need to tailor resolution to task demands and input complexity.

Method: 1) Analyze resolution preferences across vision-language tasks and quantify image complexity and VLLM uncertainty at multiple resolutions. 2) Propose an empirical formula that combines image complexity and uncertainty variance to predict the optimal resolution for a given task. 3) Introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to enable VLLMs to operate at the identified optimal resolution. 4) Validate the approach through extensive experiments on diverse V+L tasks.

Result: The empirical formula effectively predicts near-optimal resolutions per task, and the proposed tuning method allows upgrading the model's perceptual input to that resolution with minimal trainable parameters, yielding improvements over fixed-resolution baselines across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: Adaptive, task-aware resolution selection together with efficient fine-tuning enhances VLLMs’ performance and practicality in real-world vision-language applications, supporting more flexible and efficient perceptual granularity.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve segmentation clarity in satellite imagery by selecting an effective CRF, addressing the issue of low-quality feature representations.

Method: Started with different types of CRFs, studied their suitability, and evaluated them on two datasets (low-quality satellite imagery and high-quality aerial photographs) by experimenting with various CRFs to identify which yields the best results and to discuss pitfalls and potentials.

Result: The study identifies which CRF provides the best results across datasets and discusses the pitfalls and potentials of different CRF approaches; results show that effectiveness depends on data quality and CRF type.

Conclusion: CRFs can improve segmentation clarity, but their success is data-dependent; careful selection and understanding of CRF properties are necessary.

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

Motivation: Privacy concerns limit access to large-scale bona fide face datasets, creating a need to improve S-MAD generalization with synthetic data.

Method: Use diverse morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation; implement an incremental testing protocol to measure generalization as synthetic images are added; mix synthetic images with existing data and gradually add bona fide images during training.

Result: Generalization improves with carefully controlled incorporation of synthetic data; indiscriminate use leads to sub-optimal performance; relying solely on synthetic data yields the highest EER.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can aid S-MAD when used in a controlled, incremental manner, but relying exclusively on synthetic data is not advisable; a mixed training approach with bona fide data is preferable.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

### [14] [Cell Instance Segmentation: The Devil Is in the Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09848)
*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Ceb, a boundary-aware pixel clustering method for cell instance segmentation that uses boundary signatures and a classifier to merge/split regions from semantic maps, outperforming pixel-clustering baselines and reaching competitive SOTA levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise objective methods (distance maps, heat diffusion, star-shaped geometries) often discard important geometric properties (shape, curvature, convexity) of cell instances because a collection of pixels is needed to represent such properties.

Method: From semantic segmentation maps, apply a revised Watershed to extract potential fg-fg boundaries. For each boundary candidate, build a boundary signature by sampling boundary pixels and neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Use a boundary classifier to predict a binary boundary label. Partition or merge neighboring regions according to predicted boundaries to form cell instances.

Result: Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on six datasets and achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods.

Conclusion: Boundary-feature based clustering effectively preserves geometric properties of cell instances, enabling accurate cell instance segmentation from semantic probability maps.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [15] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPEL improves prompt ensembles for vision-language models by keeping cluster-based prompts and ensembling in logit space, with cluster-preserving regularization and adaptive prompt weighting to boost robustness and prevent centroid drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features can shift class centroids away from the true distribution, reducing zero-shot transfer reliability. There is a need to preserve the intrinsic cluster structure of class prompts and align them with the actual visual distribution.

Method: 1) Represent each class with multiple cluster-specific prompts. 2) Classify images into class clusters, each with its own prompt. 3) Ensemble by combining logits from prompts (logit-space ensembling) rather than averaging features. 4) Introduce a cluster-preserving regularization term to keep prompts distinct and specialized (prevent collapse). 5) Add adaptive prompt weighting to dynamically adjust attention weights for flawed/ambiguous prompts, improving robustness across datasets/tasks.

Result: The abstract does not provide quantitative results; it outlines the method and intended benefits. The paper claims improved robustness and performance through logit-space ensembling, regularization, and adaptive weighting, but specific empirical outcomes are not stated in the abstract.

Conclusion: CAPEL offers a cluster-aware alternative to standard prompt ensembling for VLMs like CLIP by preserving prompt diversity in a multi-cluster framework, performing ensembling in logit space, and incorporating regularization and adaptive weighting to maintain discriminative power and robustness across tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

### [16] [Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878)
*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised encoder fuses depth and segmentation-mask cues to create stable object representations for MOT, enabling matching without segmentation IoU. It improves tracking-by-detection (TBD) performance and is competitive on simpler benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based data association struggles when objects are similar or occluded, and computing segmentation mask IoU is costly. The work seeks robust, fine-grained cues from depth and masks without heavy IoU computations.

Method: Fuse depth maps (from a zero-shot estimator) and object masks (from a promptable segmentation model) and pass through a compact self-supervised encoder to produce stable object embeddings. Use these embeddings as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding-box IoU and ReID features for MOT data association. The encoder is self-supervised and refines segmentation masks without using masks IoU. The approach applies to joint-detection–re-identification (JDR) and especially tracking-by-detection (TBD) models.

Result: On challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowding (SportsMOT, DanceTrack), the TBD-based method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics and remains competitive on simpler, linear-motion benchmarks like MOT17.

Conclusion: A self-supervised depth-and-mask representation can refine segmentation cues and provide a robust similarity source for MOT without masks IoU, yielding strong performance, particularly for TBD methods and challenging scenes.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

TL;DR: Introduces CHUG, the first large-scale crowdsourced HDR-VQA dataset for UGC content; 856 source videos expanded to 5,992 transcoded clips, with 211,848 subjective ratings; designed to probe no-reference HDR-VQA on real-world degradations; publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in HDR-VQA datasets that focus on professional content; real-world UGC-HDR degradations from diverse capture/edit/compression remain underexplored; need for NR-VQA benchmarks and modeling.

Method: Collect subjective ratings via Amazon Mechanical Turk; transform 856 UGC-HDR sources into multiple resolution/bitrate variants to simulate real-world streaming; aggregate ~212k ratings; provide public dataset and benchmark.

Result: CHUG yields a large, diverse UGC-HDR dataset with 5,992 transcoded videos and 211,848 ratings; first large-scale study of UGC-HDR quality; provides a benchmark for NR HDR-VQA.

Conclusion: CHUG fills a critical gap, enabling NR HDR-VQA research on real-world UGC-HDR distortions; expected to advance understanding and modeling; dataset publicly available.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

### [18] [Geometry-Aware Scene Configurations for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09880)
*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scene-adaptive NeRF approach for indoor scenes that uses geometric priors to non-uniformly place representation bases and adaptive viewpoints, improving rendering quality and memory efficiency over uniform basis layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments are highly irregular with multiple rooms, clutter, and occlusions. Efficiently representing and rendering such scenes from incomplete observations requires adaptive allocation of resources guided by available geometric priors.

Method: Leverage a geometric scaffold to record observation statistics and guide non-uniform placement of basis functions; introduce scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for view-configuration deficiencies; apply regularization; compare against uniform-basis baselines in large-scale indoor scenes, analyzing rendering quality and memory usage.

Result: Significant improvements in rendering quality and memory efficiency relative to baselines that use uniform basis placements, demonstrating the effectiveness of geometry-guided adaptive representation for large-scale indoor environments.

Conclusion: Geometry-guided, scene-adaptive allocation of representation capacity and viewpoints enhances NeRF-based indoor rendering, enabling better quality with lower memory in complex indoor scenes.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

### [19] [LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881)
*Minkwan Kim,Seungmin Lee,Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTGS enables long-term, Gaussian-based scene chronology from sparse views, letting casual captures support evolving 3D environments with fast, lightweight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of capturing everyday scenes that change over time with casual, sparse data; existing methods require dense, multi-view temporally aligned observations. LTGS aims to model long-term scene changes efficiently and robustly.

Method: Start from an incomplete, unstructured Gaussian splatting representation from an initial image set. Build template Gaussian objects as reusable priors to track shared structures. Refine these priors with a few-shot adaptation to temporally varying environments. Use simple time-step transformations to generalize across multiple times. Collect real-world sparse datasets for evaluation. Compare against baselines and demonstrate faster, lighter updates with superior reconstruction quality.

Result: LTGS achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baselines while enabling fast, lightweight updates and scalable long-term evolution of 3D scenes from sparse captures.

Conclusion: LTGS provides a robust, scalable framework for long-term 3D scene chronology under sparse, casual captures, enabling persistent and adaptable representations of real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

### [20] [An uncertainty-aware framework for data-efficient multi-view animal pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09903)
*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive, uncertainty-aware multi-view pose estimation framework (MVT) that combines novel training/post-processing techniques with model distillation to enable accurate, label-efficient animal pose tracking across species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view pose estimation methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and provide poor uncertainty estimates, hindering reliable downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Method: Proposes a multi-view transformer (MVT) with pretrained backbones for simultaneous cross-view processing; introduces a patch masking scheme for robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration; for calibrated setups, uses 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss to enforce geometric consistency; extends Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) to nonlinear cases and adds variance inflation to improve uncertainty estimates; develops a distillation procedure that uses improved EKS predictions/uncertainties to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Result: Across three diverse species (flies, mice, chickadees), each component consistently enhances performance, with the integrated framework delivering improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework yields a practical, uncertainty-aware pose estimation system capable of reliable downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints, while also reducing the need for manual labeling through distillation.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

TL;DR: Hybrid 2D/3D transformer for UAV hyperspectral perception with SpectralCA cross-attention, enabling real-time navigation/object detection with improved accuracy and efficiency on WHU-Hi-HongHu.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs struggle in complex environments where conventional navigation fails; hyperspectral imaging provides material-level discrimination; there is a need to fuse spectral and spatial cues efficiently for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, environmental monitoring.

Method: Modify Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by adding SpectralCA block using bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features; design a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture; review existing HSI methods; train and benchmark.

Result: SpectralCA improves accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time; evaluated on WHU-Hi-HongHu using OA, AA, and Kappa; findings show improved UAV perception efficiency and real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring.

Conclusion: Integrating HSI into UAV perception via SpectralCA-based MDvT yields a capable real-time solution for navigation and scene understanding in challenging environments; potential extensions include semi-supervised learning and broader HSI datasets.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

### [22] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-step diffusion approach (HeadsUp) for end-to-end portrait super-resolution that jointly restores and upscales portraits, with face supervision and a reference-based identity restoration mechanism, to avoid boundary artifacts from blending face-and-background models; accompanied by a high-quality PortraitSR-4K dataset; claims state-of-the-art results on PortraitISR and competitive performance on general images and aligned faces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portrait photos typically include both difficult-to-synthesize facial regions and natural backgrounds. Existing ISR methods either target generic real-world images or strictly aligned faces; blending specialized face and general models creates boundary artifacts and facial fidelity issues that are perceptually sensitive.

Method: Built on a single-step diffusion model (HeadsUp) with a face supervision mechanism to focus the denoising process on facial regions and a reference-based module to aid identity preservation during restoration; trained and evaluated on PortraitSR-4K (a high-quality 4K portrait ISR dataset).

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on PortraitISR while maintaining or surpassing performance on general image and aligned-face benchmarks.

Conclusion: Proposes an end-to-end portrait ISR framework that eliminates boundary artifacts from model blending, improves facial fidelity, and provides a high-quality dataset to support portrait restoration research.

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using diffusion models to diversify underwater image datasets (stereo, wide-angle, macro, close-up) and ControlNet to enhance image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses poor image quality and lack of diversity in underwater datasets, which hinder generalization and the ability to study marine ecosystems.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) expand datasets with a denoising diffusion model to synthesize stereo, wide-angle, macro, and close-up underwater images; (2) apply ControlNet-based enhancement to improve image quality and evaluate dataset improvements.

Result: The abstract outlines a plan without presenting empirical results.

Conclusion: If adopted, this plan could improve dataset diversity and image quality, enabling better underwater image analysis for ocean research; it calls for community action to diversify datasets and enhance data quality.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

### [24] [Semi-disentangled spatiotemporal implicit neural representations of longitudinal neuroimaging data for trajectory classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09936)
*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven method uses Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model continuous brain aging trajectories from longitudinal T1 MRI, with an INR that partly disentangles spatial/temporal factors and classifies aging trajectories in INR parameter space. On simulated data with irregular sampling, it achieves 81.3% accuracy, beating a 73.7% DL baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal neuroimaging data are irregular and discretely sampled, making it hard for traditional deep learning to capture underlying, continuous aging processes. There is a need for a continuous, subject-specific representation of brain aging trajectories to better characterize typical and atypical aging (e.g., dementia).

Method: Develop a novel INR architecture that partially disentangles spatial and temporal trajectory parameters. Operate directly on the INR parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. Validate using biologically grounded trajectory simulations of 3D T1-weighted MRI for 450 subjects (healthy and dementia-like) with both regular and irregular sampling.

Result: In the irregular sampling scenario, the INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for brain aging trajectory classification, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline at 73.7%.

Conclusion: Implicit Neural Representations enable continuous, data-driven modeling of brain aging trajectories and improved classification under irregular sampling. While promising, validation on real-world data is needed, and future work could enhance disentanglement and generalization across modalities and populations.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

### [25] [Explainable Human-in-the-Loop Segmentation via Critic Feedback Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09945)
*Pouya Shaeri,Ryan T. Woo,Yasaman Mohammadpour,Ariane Middel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop interactive framework for segmentation that uses targeted corrections as interventional signals to reduce reliance on spurious cues, propagates edits across visually similar images, and improves generalization while reducing annotation effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models achieve high benchmark accuracy but rely on superficial correlations and artifacts that fail in real-world domains; there is a need to identify failure modes and correct them efficiently rather than simply adding data.

Method: Treat human corrections as interventional signals; propagate correction-informed edits across visually similar images; iterative feedback to steer the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features; aims to resist dataset biases and artifacts.

Result: Up to 9 mIoU points (12-15% relative) improvement on challenging cubemap data; 3-4x reduction in annotation effort versus standard retraining; maintains competitive performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework offers a practical approach to building segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on

*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-strategy framework REAS-Det for Shatian pomelo detection under real-world orchard variability, combining multi-scenario data, data augmentations, and novel modules to handle scale and occlusion, achieving high P, R, and mAP metrics and outperforming SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of Shatian pomelo is needed due to a large market, but real-world conditions (device diversity, lighting, scale, occlusion) degrade existing specialized networks. The paper aims to bridge the domain gap by addressing these factors.

Method: Create STP-AgriData by merging real orchard images with internet data; apply contrast/brightness augmentations; design REAS-Det with RFAConv and C3RFEM for scale; MultiSEAM and soft-NMS for occlusion; evaluate with P, R, mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95.

Result: Achieves P 87.6%, R 74.9%, mAP@0.5 82.8%, mAP@0.5:0.95 53.3%; outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on the task.

Conclusion: The multi-strategy approach effectively mitigates device, illumination, scale, and occlusion challenges in pomelo detection, enabling reliable automated inspection applicable to lean production and similar agricultural detection tasks.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

### [27] [J-RAS: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Retrieval-Augmented Joint Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09953)
*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS) jointly trains a segmentation model with a retrieval model to leverage retrieved image–mask pairs, improving medical image segmentation across backbones and datasets, demonstrated on ACDC and M&Ms with notable gains (e.g., SegFormer on ACDC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of annotated medical images and poor generalization across varied imaging conditions and inter-patient variability; leveraging retrieval-derived contextual cues can enrich segmentation beyond pixel similarity and reduce annotation burden.

Method: Propose J-RAS, a joint optimization framework where a retrieval model fetches relevant image–mask pairs and a segmentation model leverages these cues for boundary delineation. Validated across backbones (U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, SegFormer) on ACDC and M&Ms, with retrieval-guided segmentation enhancing performance.

Result: J-RAS yields consistent improvements across architectures and datasets; e.g., SegFormer on ACDC: Dice improves from 0.8708±0.042 to 0.9115±0.031, HD improves from 1.8130±2.49 to 1.1489±0.30.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing retrieval and segmentation yields better accuracy and robustness, leveraging contextual cues to guide segmentation while reducing reliance on large annotated datasets; method demonstrates strong generalizability across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

### [28] [Scaling Traffic Insights with AI and Language Model-Powered Camera Systems for Data-Driven Transportation Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09981)
*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, AI-powered traffic-monitoring framework using existing cameras, combining a fine-tuned YOLOv11, graph-based viewpoint normalization, and an LLM for automated summaries; validated on NYC congestion-pricing rollout with million-scale image data, showing policy-relevant trends and minimized human input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses high costs and limited sensor deployment for traffic monitoring, particularly during disruptions; video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data from large camera networks; aims to enable accurate, real-time, and long-term monitoring at scale using existing infrastructure.

Method: An end-to-end AI pipeline: (1) fine-tuned YOLOv11 on localized urban scenes to extract multimodal traffic density and classifications in real time; (2) a graph-based viewpoint normalization to handle non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras; (3) a domain-specific large language model processing continuous video data to generate frequent automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns; (4) validation on ~9 million images from ~1,000 cameras during NYC congestion pricing rollout in 2025.

Result: Nine percent reduction in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone; early truck-volume reductions with signs of rebound; sustained increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales; prompt engineering (example-based prompts) improved the LLM’s numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, infrastructure-ready framework for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention, potentially enabling timely decision support during disruptions and policy implementations.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [29] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-informed flare data generation pipeline (FlareX) combines 2D templates and 3D rendering to create diverse, physically grounded flare datasets for robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare datasets rely on 2D overlays of artificial templates with limited diversity and neglect physical illumination principles, hindering real-world generalization; there is also a need for realistic real-world flare-free references.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) parameterized template creation to generate diverse flare templates, (2) illumination-aware 2D synthesis following physical illumination laws, (3) physics-based 3D rendering to produce flare images; includes a masking approach to derive real-world flare-free images from corrupted ones to evaluate models.

Result: FlareX comprises 9,500 2D templates (from 95 flare patterns) and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D scenes, enabling both 2D and 3D perspectives and offering a mixed, more realistic dataset.

Conclusion: Physics-informed generation and mixed 2D/3D data improve the generalization of flare-removal/normalization models to real-world data; extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach and dataset.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

### [30] [BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09996)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BurstDeflicker: a scalable flicker-removal benchmark built with a Retinex-based synthesis pipeline, 4,000 real flicker images, and a green-screen motion augmentation method to cover diverse flicker patterns and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker artifacts from rolling shutter cameras under AC lighting degrade image quality and hinder high-level tasks; there is a lack of large, realistic datasets to drive progress in flicker removal.

Method: 1) Retinex-based synthesis to controllably manipulate flicker attributes (intensity, area, frequency); 2) capture of 4,000 real-world flicker images across scenes; 3) a green-screen technique to insert motion into image pairs while preserving flicker degradation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show the dataset is effective and capable of advancing flicker removal research by improving model generalization to real-world flicker patterns.

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker provides a scalable, realistic benchmark and dataset suite that facilitates development and evaluation of flicker-removal approaches in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

*Yanyuan Chen,Dexuan Xu,Yu Huang,Songkun Zhan,Hanpin Wang,Dongxue Chen,Xueping Wang,Meikang Qiu,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MIMO, a medical vision-language model with visual referring input and pixel-grounding output, plus MIMOSeg dataset; shows effectiveness on medical multimodal tasks by grounding outputs to image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VQA models struggle because they rely only on text and emit text, lacking direct visual grounding and localization within medical images; need joint visual understanding and grounded outputs.

Method: Propose MIMO architecture enabling visual referring multimodal input and pixel-grounding multimodal output; build MIMOSeg dataset (~895k samples) from four perspectives including instruction following and complex QA; conduct experiments on multiple medical multimodal tasks.

Result: MIMO uniquely combines visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities, outperforming previous models on tasks requiring alignment between text and image regions; MIMOSeg helps scale training in data-scarce medical domain.

Conclusion: A unified approach with grounded outputs and diverse data enables more interpretable and accurate medical VLMs, representing a step forward for grounded medical multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

### [32] [Q-Adapter: Visual Query Adapter for Extracting Textually-related Features in Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10022)
*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight Q-Adapter improves PEFT for video captioning in multimodal LMs; achieves state-of-the-art among PEFT methods on MSR-VTT and MSVD with 1.4% of parameters; competitive with full fine-tuning on standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large video-language models is computationally expensive. PEFT traditionally focuses on language components; multimodal PEFT remains underexplored and lacks effective use of visual information during fine-tuning. There is a need to enable efficient, caption-relevant visual feature extraction without external textual supervision.

Method: Propose Q-Adapter, a visual adapter module inserted into the Vision Encoder with learnable query tokens and a gating layer. It enables sparse, caption-relevant feature extraction without external textual supervision and supports efficient fine-tuning for video captioning. Evaluated on MSR-VTT and MSVD against PEFT and full fine-tuning baselines, with ablation studies on hyperparameters.

Result: On MSR-VTT and MSVD, Q-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr. It is competitive with full fine-tuning while using only 1.4% of parameters. Ablation analyses show the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on tuning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Q-Adapter demonstrates strong potential for balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency in video-language modeling, highlighting the scalability of adapter-based tuning for multimodal tasks and guiding optimization strategies for such approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

*Henan Wang,Hanxin Zhu,Xinliang Gong,Tianyu He,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS introduces a compact 4D dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representation by predicting 3D anchor points across time and compressing them with adaptive quantization and entropy coding, achieving high RD performance with minimal storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3DGaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles with memory growth due to temporal/spatial redundancies in 4D scenes; a compact, fast, high-quality reconstruction is needed.

Method: Develop a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module that exploits intra/inter-frame correlations among Gaussian primitives, plus adaptive quantization and context-based entropy coding to compress anchor points for efficient 4D modeling.

Result: On synthetic and real datasets, P-4DGS attains state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and fastest rendering, with storage around 1 MB on average and compression gains up to 40x (synthetic) and 90x (real-world) over prior dynamic 3DGS methods.

Conclusion: P-4DGS delivers strong rate-distortion performance, enabling practical, high-fidelity, real-time rendering of compact 4D scenes.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CCFormer, a Transformer-based AVS framework combining Early Integration, Multi-query Transformer, and Bi-modal Contrastive Learning to capture spatial-temporal context and cross-modal alignment, achieving state-of-the-art on AVS benchmarks; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome CNN-based limits (local receptive fields) and Transformer gaps (insufficient multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics) in audio-visual segmentation.

Method: Early Integration Module (EIM): parallel bilateral architecture merging multi-scale visual features with audio; Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM): dynamic audio queries and frame/video-level relation modeling; Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL): aligns audio-visual representations in a unified space.

Result: States achieved new SOTA on S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CCFormer effectively fuses local/global info and temporal context, advancing AVS performance and providing public code upon release.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTAR introduces an iterative think-act-rethink-answer framework for medical vision-language models, enabling multi-step visual reasoning that mirrors expert clinicians. It is aided by curated interactive and VQA datasets and a two-stage training regime, resulting in stronger performance and more grounded, trustworthy reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image interpretation is inherently iterative and region-focused; conventional single-pass VLMs often miss localized cues and lack interpretability. The work aims to close the perception gap between machine and clinicians by embedding cognitive reasoning steps into VLMs.

Method: Proposes ViTAR, a dual-stage VLM framework with interactive object-centric visual reasoning using a think-act-rethink-answer loop. It leverages a 1k interactive instruction dataset encoding expert-like diagnostic behaviors and a 16k visual question answering dataset for fine-grained diagnosis, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making.

Result: ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual-attention analyses reveal increasing grounding in clinically critical regions from think to rethink rounds, with sustained attention to visual tokens, offering mechanistic insight into improved performance.

Conclusion: Embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into medical VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

TL;DR: DREAM is a new benchmark for deepfake realism assessment, featuring a diverse deepfake video dataset, 140k realism scores with textual descriptions from 3.5k annotators, and evaluation of 16 realism assessment methods, including a description-aligned CLIP approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective perception of deepfakes is under-studied and crucial for understanding deception, informing evaluation, and guiding improvement of deepfake generation models.

Method: Introduce a comprehensive benchmark DREAM (Deepfake Realism Assessment) with a diverse quality video dataset, collect large-scale realism annotations (140,000 scores) and textual descriptions from 3,500 human annotators, and evaluate 16 realism assessment methods, including recent large vision-language models and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method.

Result: Provided DREAM as a benchmarking resource and performed comprehensive evaluation of 16 realism assessment methods; introduced a description-aligned CLIP method; generated large-scale human-annotated realism data and textual descriptions to enable future research.

Conclusion: DREAM establishes a foundational benchmark for subjective realism assessment in deepfakes, enabling robust evaluation, comparison, and potential improvements in deepfake generation guided by human-aligned realism metrics.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete labels in multi-label recognition hinder performance; need to exploit semantic correlations and bridge visual-semantic spaces; develop a coordinated framework to learn robust features and recover labels.

Method: 1) semantic-related feature learning module discovers semantic information and label correlations to learn semantic-related features; 2) semantic-guided feature enhancement aligns visual and semantic spaces to produce discriminative semantic-aware features; 3) collaborative learning loop jointly updates feature learning and label recovery, enabling mutual reinforcement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, NUS-WIDE).

Conclusion: The CLSL framework effectively integrates feature learning and label recovery, improving recognition under incomplete labels and enabling mutual reinforcement between learning and recovery.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

### [38] [Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Multiple Randomly Masked Autoencoders for Semi-supervised Multi-modal Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10068)
*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PHG-MAE, a probabilistic hyper-graph model that fuses masked autoencoders with neural graphs to enable multi-modal, self-supervised pretraining, single-loop fine-tuning, and inference-time ensembles for improved robustness and efficiency, with a data-pipeline for automated Dronescapes extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage abundant unlabeled multi-modal data and unify graph-based semi-supervised learning with modern masked autoencoder pretraining. Aim to improve performance and robustness in multi-modal tasks (e.g., UAV, autonomous driving) while enabling lightweight, distillable models and automated data pipelines.

Method: Random masking of entire modalities to sample hyper-edges in a probabilistic hyper-graph during forward passes; integrate pretraining and fine-tuning in a single training loop; construct inference-time ensembles via aggregation; apply knowledge distillation on ensembles to produce small models; provide and release data-pipeline software for multi-modal, multi-task learning and Dronescapes dataset extension.

Result: Demonstrates that ensembles yield boosted prediction performance and consistency; distillation on top of ensembles can maintain performance with very small models (sub-1M parameters); targeted evaluation on outdoor UAV scenes; datasets and code extended/released to support automation in multi-modal CV tasks.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE offers a unifying, end-to-end framework for multi-modal self-supervised learning that benefits from ensemble inference and distillation, with practical tooling for automated data pipelines and dataset extensions, and broad applicability to autonomous systems and robotics.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

### [39] [Tracking the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Landslide Scars Using a Vision Foundation Model: A Novel and Universal Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10084)
*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A universal framework that tracks spatiotemporal evolution of large landslide scars by converting remote sensing images into video-like sequences and applying a vision-based video segmentation model within a knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, interactive refinement pipeline; validated on two cases to enable continuous scar tracking and early-warning indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies struggle to track landslide scar evolution beyond single-phase or post-failure identification, limiting understanding of evolution mechanisms and failure precursors and hindering early warning and long-term hazard assessment.

Method: Transform discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence; employ a vision foundation model designed for video segmentation; implement a knowledge-guided auto-propagation and interactive refinement framework to maintain accurate, continuous scar delineation across time; validate on Baige (post-failure) and Sela (active 2017–2025).

Result: The framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing failure precursors relevant to early warning and post-failure evolution relevant for secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Conclusion: A universal, model-based approach for spatiotemporal landslide scar tracking that leverages video-segmentation foundations and user-guided refinement to monitor evolution across active and post-failure phases, with potential for improved early-warning and hazard assessment.

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat enables robust novel view synthesis and geometry from unposed sparse images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging VGGT for initialization, and introducing a hybrid Gaussian representation, graph-guided refinement, and flow-based depth regularization to outperform pose-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF/3DGS rely on accurate poses and dense viewpoint coverage; sparse-view scenarios suffer from unreliable pose estimation and limited supervision, hindering reconstruction and view synthesis.

Method: Integrates VGGT-based initial poses and dense point clouds; hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization and inter-view matching consistency; graph-guided attribute refinement module; flow-based depth regularization to improve depth supervision.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show improved robustness on forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Conclusion: Gesplat demonstrates robust, geometrically consistent reconstruction and novel view synthesis in pose-free sparse-image settings, leveraging VGGT-derived initialization to achieve better performance than prior pose-free approaches.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

### [41] [Cooperative Pseudo Labeling for Unsupervised Federated Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10100)
*Kuangpu Guo,Lijun Sheng,Yongcan Yu,Jian Liang,Zilei Wang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedCoPL is a new unsupervised federated learning method that adapts CLIP for classification. Clients upload pseudo-label distributions; the server rebalances these to mitigate global class imbalance, and a partial prompt-aggregation scheme combines shared visual prompts with locally retained text prompts to personalize models. Empirical results show it outperforms baselines, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised federated learning for classification remains challenging due to lack of labels and class imbalance. CLIP offers strong zero-shot capabilities that can be leveraged in a federated setting. The work aims to bring CLIP-based classification into UFL and address both global balance and personalization.

Method: FedCoPL collects pseudo-label distributions from clients and has the server adjust and redistribute them to reduce global class imbalance. It uses a partial prompt aggregation protocol: visual prompts are aggregated at the server to share general features, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge stay on-device to preserve personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedCoPL achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods in the UFL classification setting. Ablation studies likely show the impact of pseudo-label balancing and prompt aggregation.

Conclusion: FedCoPL enables CLIP-based unsupervised federated classification with improved performance and personalization by balancing pseudo-label distributions and separating visual/text prompts. The code is made available to the community.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [42] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACRE introduces an Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning approach that enforces alignment between reasoning traces and final answers by adding a post-reasoning consistency check: after generating a chain of thought and an initial answer, the model re-predicts with shuffled options to verify consistency. This yields modest gains on video and multimodal math benchmarks over GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcome-driven RL can improve correctness but may detach the reasoning trace from the final answer, causing inconsistencies and making models rely on spurious patterns (e.g., option order). There is a need to enforce reasoning-answer consistency in multimodal LLMs.

Method: Modify the GRPO framework by adding an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer, shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. Introduce a consistency-verification reward that is high only if both the original and post-shuffle answers are correct and agree; otherwise, reward is lowered. This discourages misalignment and reliance on superficial cues.

Result: ACRE was evaluated on Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving average improvements of 2.2 percentage points for Video Reasoning and 1.5 percentage points for Math Reasoning over the GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: ACRE effectively reduces reasoning-answer misalignment and boosts performance on multimodal reasoning tasks by enforcing consistency between the reasoning trace and the final answer, while mitigating biases such as option ordering.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight post-detection refinement boosts fire/smoke detection in compact detectors by rescoring with uncertainty and domain cues, improving precision/recall/mAP with modest overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compact detectors like YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n deployed on UAVs and IoT devices sacrifice accuracy; traditional post-processing (NMS/Soft-NMS) relies only on IoU and can miss true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered scenes. A robust, low-cost post-detection step is needed to improve reliability without changing the base model.

Method: Introduce an uncertainty aware post-detection framework. A Confidence Refinement Network (CRN) lightweightly fuses statistical uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to rescore detections, modifying confidences without retraining or altering the base detector.

Result: On the D-Fire dataset, the approach yields higher precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) than baselines, with only modest additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: Post-detection rescoring using uncertainty and domain cues enhances robustness of compact fire/smoke detectors in real-world conditions, supporting safer and more reliable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, multi-modal LLM-based framework (ICFC) for interpretable image manipulation localization using progressive reasoning and a knowledge-base of objectified rules; achieves strong results on benchmarks, competitive with supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliance on costly pixel-level annotations in supervised IML and the underperformance and lack of interpretability in existing weakly supervised/training-free methods.

Method: Introduce In-Context Forensic Chain: objectified rule construction + adaptive filtering to build a knowledge base; multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline using MLLMs to go from coarse proposals to fine-grained localization; training-free, enabling image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods across multiple benchmarks and is competitive or superior to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Conclusion: ICFC provides a practical, interpretable, training-free solution for image manipulation localization that leverages MLLMs and expert-forensic workflows, showing strong generalization without labeled pixel data.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale off-axis iris dataset for immersive recognition, and a normalization-free learning approach that outperforms traditional normalization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of off-axis iris data in immersive VR/AR and the failure of normalization-based recognition under perspective distortions in wearable setups.

Method: Collected ImmerIris with 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects; defined benchmarks for various challenges; proposed a normalization-free paradigm that learns directly from raw ocular images with minimal adjustment.

Result: Normalization-free model consistently outperforms normalization-based methods; ImmerIris is the largest public off-axis iris dataset to date; established evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: Normalization-free learning is a promising direction for robust immersive iris recognition; dedicated datasets and methods are needed for off-axis conditions.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

TL;DR: A multi-class Parkinson's disease severity detection method from finger-tapping videos using an attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM that fuses spatial-temporal features to classify five severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease severity assessment is critical for management, yet existing gesture-based approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and non-invasive, scalable solutions are needed.

Method: Collect finger-tapping videos and derive temporal, frequency, and amplitude-based features from wrist and hand movements. Propose a hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification. Input sequences are reshaped and passed through a Conv1D MaxPooling block, followed by a BiLSTM to model temporal dynamics. An attention mechanism selects informative temporal features to produce a context vector, processed by a second BiLSTM. CNN features and attended BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, then fed through dense and dropout layers to a final softmax classifier predicting five severity classes.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve automated PD severity detection.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN-derived spatial features with attention-enhanced BiLSTM temporal dynamics improves non-invasive PD severity assessment and can support clinicians in monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

*Halil Hüseyin Çalışkan,Talha Koruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet enables efficient low-light enhancement and autoencoder-based super-resolution with strong performance at a fraction of the parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light/dark images hinder computer vision tasks; traditional autoencoders improve brightness but are computationally heavy and exhibit suboptimal SSIM/PSNR; a lightweight, high-quality solution is needed.

Method: Proposes the DeepFusionNet architecture for dark-image enhancement and extends it to an autoencoder-based super-resolution pipeline. On LOL-v1, the dark-image module uses ~2.5M parameters to achieve high-quality restoration; the SR module uses the same architecture with ~100k parameters.

Result: Dark-image enhancement on LOL-v1 yielded SSIM 0.928 and PSNR 26.30 with ~2.5M parameters. The autoencoder-based SR variant using DeepFusionNet achieved PSNR 25.30 and SSIM 0.807 on validation with ~100k parameters.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet delivers competitive restoration quality with far fewer parameters, supporting efficient real-time enhancement and light-weight SR without relying on GANs.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi is suitable for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchards and demonstrates potential for broader precision-agriculture applications.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

### [49] [Color3D: Controllable and Consistent 3D Colorization with Personalized Colorizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10152)
*Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Renlong Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D reframes 3D colorization as a single-image colorization task by training a scene-specific, personalized colorizer from a single reference view to propagate colors across novel views and time steps, enabling consistent, diverse, and user-controlled colorizations for static and dynamic scenes using a Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D colorization methods often enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations, which reduces chromatic richness and controllability. There is a need for retaining color diversity and user steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency in static and dynamic scenes.

Method: Train a personalized colorizer on a single key view to learn a deterministic, scene-specific color mapping. Use this colorizer to propagate colors to novel views and video frames. Represent color with a Lab-space Gaussian splatting approach. Recast 3D colorization as a single-image paradigm, allowing integration of arbitrary image colorization models. Apply to both static and dynamic 3D scenes with controllable user guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks show improved chromatic richness, cross-view/time consistency, and user control compared to averaging-based baselines. Demonstrates robust performance across diverse scenes and under user-guided manipulations. Project page provided for reference.

Conclusion: Color3D offers a flexible, controllable, and consistent 3D colorization framework by leveraging a personalized colorizer learned from a single reference view, enabling arbitrary image colorization models to colorize 3D content while maintaining cross-view and cross-time coherence.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

*Mohamed Hamad,Muhammad Khan,Tamer Khattab,Mohamed Mabrok*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stroke Locus Net proposes an end-to-end pipeline combining lesion segmentation and arterial atlas-based vessel localization with MRI-to-MRA synthesis to localize occluded vessels in ischemic stroke.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches in ischemic stroke focus mainly on lesion segmentation, with limited work on accurate vessel localization; precise occluded-vessel localization could improve diagnostic speed and treatment planning.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline with (1) a segmentation branch using nnUNet for lesion detection, (2) an arterial atlas for vessel mapping/localization, and (3) a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MR angiography from MRI, enabling simultaneous detection, segmentation, and occluded-vessel localization.

Result: The approach demonstrates promising capability to localize occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, indicating potential for faster and more informed stroke diagnosis.

Conclusion: The study shows feasibility of integrating segmentation with atlas-based vessel localization and MRI-to-MRA synthesis to localize occluded vessels, suggesting a viable path toward clinically useful tools; further validation on larger datasets is needed.

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

### [51] [ReMix: Towards a Unified View of Consistent Character Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10156)
*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix is a unified diffusion-based framework for character-consistent generation and editing, built from a ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet that align semantics and layout without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generation and editing methods are largely separate and struggle to consistently preserve identity while maintaining spatial control. A single framework is needed to unify tasks like personalized generation, editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis.

Method: Two core components: (1) ReMix Module, which uses multimodal LLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the DiT backbone without fine-tuning; (2) IP-ControlNet, an extension of ControlNet that decouples semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an epsilon-equivariant latent space to jointly denoise reference and target images in a shared noise space, promoting hidden-space feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the framework’s effectiveness and efficiency across a range of tasks (personalized generation, editing, style transfer, multi-condition synthesis) with improved identity consistency and spatial control.

Conclusion: ReMix provides a cohesive, scalable approach to character-consistent image generation and editing, bridging the gap between generation and editing within a single framework and enabling versatile tasks without heavy fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

### [52] [SaFiRe: Saccade-Fixation Reiteration with Mamba for Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10160)
*Zhenjie Mao,Yuhuan Yang,Chaofan Ma,Dongsheng Jiang,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFiRe introduces a two-phase RIS framework inspired by human cognition and Mamba's scan-update property to handle ambiguous referring expressions, plus a new aRefCOCO benchmark; it achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear-time multi-cycle refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS models struggle with referential ambiguity due to expressions containing multiple entities or implicit categories. Existing methods over-rely on keyword matching of simple phrases, limiting robustness. The paper aims to enable global understanding before detailed refinement and to evaluate these scenarios with a dedicated benchmark.

Method: Two-phase SaFiRe framework: (1) global understanding from the expression and image; (2) iterative, detail-oriented refinement guided by a scan-update mechanism (Mamba) that allows multiple refinement cycles with linear complexity. Also introduces aRefCOCO benchmark to test RIS under ambiguous referring expressions.

Result: Empirical results on standard RIS benchmarks and the proposed aRefCOCO dataset show SaFiRe outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in object-distracting and category-implicit scenarios.

Conclusion: A two-phase cognitive-inspired RIS approach with an efficient scan-update refinement and a dedicated ambiguous-expression benchmark effectively addresses referential ambiguity, marking a promising direction for robust RIS in realistic settings.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [53] [SparseUWSeg: Active Sparse Point-Label Augmentation for Underwater Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10163)
*César Borja,Carlos Plou,Rubén Martinez-Cantín,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called SparseUWSeg uses active sampling to select sparse points for annotation and a hybrid label-propagation strategy (SAM2 + superpixels) to produce dense underwater segmentation masks, aimed at efficient ecology monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense, expert-annotated segmentation labels are expensive in underwater imagery. Sparse point-labels are easier but require effective annotation guidance and propagation. The work aims to maximize information gain from sparse labels and convert them into high-quality masks for ecological analysis.

Method: An active sampling strategy selects informative annotation points for experts. Sparse labels are then propagated via a hybrid method that combines SAM2-based segmentation with superpixel-based propagation.

Result: On two diverse underwater datasets, SparseUWSeg achieves up to +5 percentage points mIoU over D+NN, outperforming state-of-the-art. An interactive annotation tool is released to help researchers generate segmentation masks efficiently.

Conclusion: The proposed simple yet effective pipeline demonstrates that well-chosen sparse labels, guided by active sampling and combined propagation, can yield competitive segmentation quality while enabling practical, tool-assisted annotation for ecology researchers.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

*Cristiano Patrício,Luís F. Teixeira,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med is a transformer-based framework that jointly predicts and localizes visual concepts using multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention, achieving improved concept detection and localization, with performance competitive to black-box models in medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based explanations treat concepts as numerical attributes and lack complementary visual localization, limiting interpretability and usefulness in high-stakes domains like medicine. There is a need for models that provide both concept-level predictions and spatial localization maps.

Method: Propose ViConEx-Med, a transformer-based framework with multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers to process visual and text-based concept tokens. The model jointly predicts concepts and generates concept-level localization maps without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets show ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in both concept detection and localization precision.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med demonstrates a promising direction for inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts and provides a publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

### [55] [HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \& Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177)
*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences by predicting 3D coordinates for both front and back object surfaces and densely sampling between them, enabled by Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE); shows improved pose estimation on seven BOP core datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense-3D coordinate methods mainly exploit front-surface information and efficient encoding, neglecting back surface and interior data that could improve PnP-based pose estimation.

Method: Predict 3D coordinates for front and back surfaces, densely sample coordinates between them to form ultra-dense correspondences; introduce Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for efficient and accurate surface representations; use PnP for pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on seven classic BOP core datasets as reported on the BOP website.

Conclusion: Leveraging full surface (front + back) and interior sampling, with HCCE, yields more accurate pose estimates and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

### [56] [TCMA: Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment for Drone Cross-Modal Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10180)
*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD) and the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework for UAV video-text retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results on drone benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV videos generate massive, real-time data with diverse semantics; existing drone caption datasets are coarse and redundant, hindering effective text-video retrieval and downstream urban/security applications.

Method: Construct DVTMD with 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained captions covering actions, objects, background, conditions, and style. Propose TCMA that uses global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment; introduce Word & Patch Selection to filter irrelevant content and a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism to adapt attention sharpness to text type.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on both DVTMD and CapERA, e.g., 45.5% R@1 for text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 for video-to-text retrieval; dataset and code will be released.

Conclusion: The dataset and TCMA framework advance drone text-video retrieval by enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment and robust localization of content, with strong practical implications for urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pseudo-balancing for debiasing semi-supervised face gender classifiers by balancing pseudo-labels using race-balanced unlabeled data; improves fairness with minimal loss in accuracy on the All-Age-Faces benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in face gender classifiers due to biased training data leads to uneven performance across gender/race subgroups; seeks a label-free approach leveraging unlabeled data to promote demographic balance.

Method: During pseudo-label selection in semi-supervised learning, enforce demographic balance using unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset; no ground-truth labels required.

Result: In two setups—fine-tuning with unlabeled FairFace data and stress-testing with imbalanced data—the method achieved 79.81% accuracy (up 6.53%), and reduced gender accuracy gap by 44.17%; East Asian subgroup gap reduced from >49% to 5.01%; improved fairness while maintaining/enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: Demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled data can serve as a powerful resource for debiasing computer vision models without requiring label supervision.

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

### [58] [B2N3D: Progressive Learning from Binary to N-ary Relationships for 3D Object Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10194)
*Feng Xiao,Hongbin Xu,Hai Ci,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a progressive n-ary relational learning framework for 3D object grounding from natural language, using grouped supervision and a hybrid-attention multi-modal network, achieving state-of-the-art results on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer by leveraging higher-order relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-language grounding often relies on pairwise relationships, but natural descriptions commonly use multiple spatial relations. Existing methods underutilize the global perceptual significance of n-ary relations, limiting localization accuracy. Extending relational learning from binary to n-ary and providing supervision to guide this process can improve 3D grounding.

Method: Introduce a progressive relational learning framework that expands from binary to n-ary relations. Use a grouped supervision loss to cope with the lack of explicit referred-object annotations. Build a scene graph with n-ary relationships and apply a multi-modal network with hybrid attention to localize targets within these n-ary combinations.

Result: Experiments and ablations on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation confirms the advantages of incorporating n-ary relational perception for 3D localization.

Conclusion: Modeling higher-order (n-ary) relationships enhances 3D object grounding from language and offers a scalable approach for global relational understanding in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CerS-Path is a two-stage, cervical-subspecialty foundation model that combines self-supervised tissue-patch learning with image-text multimodal pretraining to deliver eight diagnostic functions, showing high multicenter sensitivity and strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer requires extensive, nuanced histopathological assessment. Current DL models struggle with accuracy and generalization; broad foundation models lack subspecialty specificity and adaptability. A cervical-focused, multimodal system could improve diagnostic support and screening.

Method: Stage 1: self-supervised pretraining on ~190 million tissue patches from ~140,000 slides to learn cervical-specific features. Stage 2: multimodal pretraining with ~2.5 million image-text pairs, followed by integration into multiple downstream diagnostic functions. The system supports eight functions, including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&A.

Result: Prospective evaluation on 3,173 cases across five centers achieving 99.38% screening sensitivity and strong generalizability, with CerS-Path surpassing prior foundation models in scope and clinical applicability.

Conclusion: CerS-Path represents a substantive advance in cervical pathology, enabling subspecialty diagnostic translation and enhancing cervical cancer screening; its multimodal, task-adaptive design broadens clinical usefulness beyond traditional DL models.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

*Dingyi Yao,Xinyao Han,Ruibo Ming,Zhihang Song,Lihui Peng,Jianming Hu,Danya Yao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD), a Gram-based style-embedding metric and framework to quantify the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving, with a public benchmark and empirical validation across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the synthetic-to-real (sim-to-real) gap in autonomous driving perception, addressing the domain gap bottleneck and enabling evaluation of dataset utility and targeted improvements when real-world testing is impractical.

Method: Proposes a systematic framework for quantifying the sim-to-real gap. It uses Gram matrix-based style extraction to obtain style embeddings and employs metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation. A benchmark on publicly available datasets is established, and experiments across various datasets and sim-to-real methods assess the capability of the proposed metric to quantify the gap.

Result: SEDD successfully quantifies the synthetic-to-real gap and provides a standardized quality-control tool. The benchmark confirms its applicability across multiple datasets and sim-to-real pipelines, aiding diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic data for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The framework and SEDD enable standardized evaluation of synthetic datasets and guide improvements in data-driven autonomous driving systems, contributing toward more reliable sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: AnomReason introduces a large-scale semantic anomaly benchmark for AI-generated images, paired with AnomAgent for scalable annotations. Fine-tuned models outperform vision-language baselines on semantic matching (SemAP/SemF1) and enable explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. The work provides data, metrics, and models to advance semantic plausibility in AIGC, with release plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many AI-generated images contain semantic-level inconsistencies that undermine plausibility. There is a need for scalable, high-quality benchmarks and models that reason about semantic anomalies to assess trustworthiness and guide improvements in AIGC systems.

Method: Propose AnomReason: a benchmark of quadruples (Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity) for semantic anomalies. Use a modular multi-agent pipeline (AnomAgent) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification to scale annotations, leveraging ~4.17B GPT-4o tokens. Fine-tune models on AnomReason and evaluate with semantic matching metrics SemAP and SemF1.

Result: AnomReason-finetuned models achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines on SemAP/SemF1. The approach enables explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment. The authors plan to release code, data, metrics, and models to support reproducible research.

Conclusion: AnomReason and AnomAgent establish a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images, facilitating better detection, explanation, and governance of semantic authenticity in AIGC.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

### [63] [Are Video Models Emerging as Zero-Shot Learners and Reasoners in Medical Imaging?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10254)
*Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Ming Li,Yuheng Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot medical video modeling with a large vision model yields competitive organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and state-of-the-art motion prediction on 4D CT without medical fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether autoregressive video modeling principles from large generative models can transfer to medical imaging tasks without domain-specific training, aiming for a unified, foundation-model pathway in medical AI.

Method: Evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in zero-shot across four tasks (organs segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, motion prediction) on 4D CT data from 122 patients (~1,820 volumes). No medical-domain fine-tuning; compare against specialized baselines for motion prediction.

Result: Competitive performance in segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. In motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases from prior phases with anatomical fidelity and temporal coherence, surpassing DVF-based and generative baselines and achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy.

Conclusion: Zero-shot emergence of medical video-model capabilities; suggests general-purpose video models can serve as unified learners and reasoning engines, underpinning future medical foundation models built on video models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

### [64] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An efficiency-focused revision of 3D Gaussian Splatting for few-shot view synthesis yields far fewer primitives with only modest quality loss, achieving a new Pareto-optimal frontier for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot settings due to adaptive density control causing overfitting and bloated reconstructions; existing state-of-the-art (e.g., FSGS) improves quality at the cost of many more primitives; there is a need to prioritize efficiency without sacrificing too much quality.

Method: Replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with an opacity-gradient-based densification trigger; aggressively densify only when paired with a conservative pruning schedule to avoid destructive optimization cycles; incorporate a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance.

Result: On LLFF (3-view): ~32k primitives vs FSGS ~57k (over 40% reduction). On Mip-NeRF 360: ~70% reduction. Slight trade-off in reconstruction metrics but overall state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.

Conclusion: A fundamental efficiency improvement for 3DGS: densification guided by opacity gradient and prudent pruning yields compact representations with competitive quality, establishing a new Pareto frontier for few-shot inference.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

### [65] [VividAnimator: An End-to-End Audio and Pose-driven Half-Body Human Animation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10269)
*Donglin Huang,Yongyuan Li,Tianhang Liu,Junming Huang,Xiaoda Yang,Chi Wang,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividAnimator is an end-to-end audio- and pose-driven half-body animation framework that pre-trains a Hand Clarity Codebook to enhance hand fidelity, uses a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module to separate lip-sync and head dynamics, and applies a Pose Calibration Trick for smoother pose transitions, achieving state-of-the-art hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio- and pose-driven animation methods struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands due to weak correlations between audio and head motion and the structural complexity of hands; there is a need for higher-fidelity hand texture priors and more natural coordination between lip movement and head pose.

Method: Introduce three innovations: (1) a pre-trained Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) to encode rich hand texture priors and reduce hand degradation; (2) a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) that models lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while allowing interaction; (3) a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that relaxes rigid pose constraints to refine and align pose conditions for smooth gesture transitions, all within an end-to-end framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with videos showcasing superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, supported by quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: VividAnimator effectively addresses prior shortcomings by delivering high-quality half-body animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose cues, leveraging HCC, DSAA, and PCT to achieve natural, consistent gestures and detailed hand visuals.

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

*Markus Käppeler,Özgün Çiçek,Daniele Cattaneo,Claudius Gläser,Yakov Miron,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid PV+BEV camera-based 3D detection and tracking using DualViewDistill: BEV maps guided by foundation-model features (DINOv2) distilled into BEV, fused with PV features via deformable aggregation to achieve state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Argoverse 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D perception from cameras often relies on either perspective-view (PV) or BEV features, which separately capture fine-grained object details and spatial scene structure. A hybrid approach that leverages both views and a distillation-based BEV representation can better utilize complementary strengths for robust autonomous-driving perception.

Method: Introduce DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection/tracking framework. Build BEV maps guided by foundation models by distilling descriptive DINOv2 features into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. Integrate PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric information from DINOv2. Use deformable aggregation to fuse PV and BEV representations for improved 3D detection and tracking. Evaluate on nuScenes and Argoverse 2; provide code and pre-trained models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation-model-guided BEV maps for reliable autonomous-driving perception.

Conclusion: Foundation-model-guided BEV maps, when combined with PV features via deformable aggregation, enable more reliable and accurate 3D object detection and tracking in autonomous driving, highlighting a promising direction for leveraging foundation models in BEV representations.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

*Sayan Mandal,Divyadarshini Karthikeyan,Manas Paldhe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA presents a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for SAM2 in fundus image segmentation by inserting low-rank adapters into both the image encoder and mask decoder, achieving <5% trainable parameters and state-of-the-art cross-dataset performance on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective adaptation of large foundation models (SAM2) to medical fundus segmentation under resource constraints, addressing high training costs and limited labeled data while aiming for strong cross-dataset generalization.

Method: Integrate low-rank adapters (LoRA) into the image encoder and mask decoder of SAM2; leverage SAM2's masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale decoding; train with a composite loss combining segmentation BCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky to enhance cross-dataset tuning.

Result: On 11 fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA achieves Dice scores up to 0.86 for blood vessels and 0.93 for optic discs, with AUC up to 0.98 and 0.99 respectively, delivering state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA demonstrates that targeted, parameter-efficient fine-tuning of a foundation model can deliver robust, high-accuracy fundus segmentation in cross-dataset settings with a small fraction of trainable parameters.

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

*Joy Hsu,Emily Jin,Jiajun Wu,Niloy J. Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactoredScenes presents a structured, programmatic approach to synthesize realistic 3D indoor scenes by factoring layout priors and object pose variation, leveraging a library of reusable room programs and LLM-generated high-level programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world indoor datasets (e.g., ScanNet) are scarce and hard to capture; there is a need for diverse, realistic scene synthesis to train and evaluate scene understanding models.

Method: Propose a factored representation decomposing scenes into room programs and object poses. Learn a library of reusable layout patterns; use large language models to generate high-level scene programs regularized by the library; train a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses and place 3D objects accordingly.

Result: The method yields realistic indoor scenes that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes, demonstrating convincing synthesis quality.

Conclusion: FactoredScenes effectively combines structure-aware layout generation with pose variation learning to synthesize realistic 3D indoor scenes, offering a scalable approach grounded in real-world room priors.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework for ordinal traffic congestion classification using CLIP, YOLO-World, and MOG2, achieving ~76.7% accuracy and QWK 0.684, improving over unimodal baselines; future work includes vehicle sizing and density metrics.


<details>

Motivation: Addresses the need for accurate, interpretable, real-time congestion labeling by leveraging visual-language reasoning, object detection, and motion cues to preserve ordinal structure and enhance interpretability.

Method: Integrates open-vocabulary CLIP-based visual-language reasoning, YOLO-World object detection, and MOG2 background subtraction for motion analysis; outputs congestion level 1-5 with motion-based confidence weighting and annotated visuals.

Result: Achieves 76.7% accuracy, F1 score 0.752, Quadratic Weighted Kappa 0.684; outperforms unimodal baselines, indicating effective cross-modal fusion and preservation of ordinal structure.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness of combining visual-language and motion modalities for semantically aligned, temporally consistent congestion classification; suggests future improvements in vehicle sizing and density metrics.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse uses optical-flow to synthesize intermediate frames and reduce required image overlap for orthomosaic reconstruction by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photogrammetric orthomosaic generation demands high inter-image overlap (70-80%), hindering AI-driven crop monitoring under resource constraints; improving robustness and uptake.

Method: An optical-flow-based framework that estimates intermediate frames between successive aerial images to augment feature correspondences, enabling reliable geometric reconstruction with lower overlap.

Result: Experimental validation shows a 20% reduction in minimum overlap requirements; improved reconstruction reliability in sparse imagery; includes adoption barriers analysis for precision agriculture.

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse enables reliable orthomosaic generation with reduced overlap, facilitating broader adoption of AI-driven crop health monitoring; highlights integration pathways to overcome adoption barriers.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

*Linlian Jiang,Rui Ma,Li Gu,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointMAC uses meta-learned test-time adaptation with self-supervised auxiliary objectives to refine point cloud encoders per-sample for robust completion, achieving state-of-the-art results without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point cloud completion models are static and rely on inductive biases learned during training, which hurts adaptability to novel structural patterns and sensor distortions at test time.

Method: Two self-supervised auxiliary objectives simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) based meta-auxiliary strategy aligns auxiliary-driven adaptation with the main completion task. During inference, the shared encoder is adapted online using auxiliary losses while the decoder stays fixed. Adaptive λ-Calibration meta-learns gradient balancing between primary and auxiliary objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world data show PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually for high-quality completions; claimed to be the first to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.

Conclusion: PointMAC enables per-sample refinement at test time to improve completion quality, introducing a new meta-learning approach for robust 3D perception and opening avenues for future meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation in point clouds.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-based foundation models applied to PPG by converting 1D signals into 2D representations (e.g., STFT). Fine-tuned VFMs like DINOv3/SIGLIP-2 yield SOTA results on BP estimation and other tasks, with good generalization and efficiency via PEFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG offers noninvasive real-time physiological insights, but robust, general models are needed. Vision models, especially foundation models, may transfer well to time-series data when cast as images.

Method: Transform 1D PPG into 2D inputs (STFT, phase, recurrence plots). Fine-tune vision foundation models (DINOv3, SIGLIP-2) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Compare to time-series FMs across six tasks; test generalization to other 2D representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tasks, notably blood pressure estimation; demonstrates strong performance on other vital signs and lab measurements; shows generalization across different 2D representations; efficient training via PEFT.

Conclusion: Vision4PPG opens a new use of vision foundation models for PPG, offering SOTA potential and broad applicability with efficient fine-tuning, enabling clinicians to leverage powerful 2D-FM tools.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully self-supervised framework, Crack-Segmenter, achieves pixel-level pavement crack segmentation without manual annotations and outperforms 13 supervised methods across 10 public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crack detection traditionally requires costly pixel-level annotations, hindering scalable, large-scale infrastructure monitoring; a calibration-free, annotation-free approach could enable widespread, cost-effective maintenance.

Method: Crack-Segmenter combines three modules: Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for multi-scale feature extraction, Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for preserving linear crack continuity, and Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) for adaptive feature integration, all trained in a self-supervised manner and evaluated on 10 public datasets.

Result: Consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods on major metrics (mIoU, Dice, XOR, Hausdorff Distance) across ten datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of annotation-free crack detection.

Conclusion: Annotation-free crack detection is feasible and superior, enabling scalable, cost-effective pavement monitoring and advancing self-supervised learning in infrastructure image analysis.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised

*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes methods to detect and separate contextual bias vs background noise in CNNs; uses tile-shuffling and image transforms; validated on six datasets; enables bias awareness without labeled background data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are powerful yet opaque; their decisions can rely on hidden contextual cues and background information, leading to biased or spurious results. There is a need to identify such biases and differentiate context from noise.

Method: Two approaches: (1) divide images into smaller non-overlapping tiles of varying sizes and shuffle them to disrupt context; (2) apply several image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet, Median filter) and combinations to reveal background noise information used by CNNs; tested on six datasets including natural, synthetic, and hybrid.

Result: Transform-based and tiling methods help recover and identify background noise cues; the approaches can effectively distinguish contextual information from background noise and alert users to the presence of background noise even without background data.

Conclusion: The study offers practical techniques to diagnose CNN biases, enabling practitioners to separate context from foreground signals and to flag background noise that may drive classification decisions.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance

### [76] [Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10406)
*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait: an end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that reconstructs 3D heatmaps from 2D silhouettes to fuse 3D geometry with silhouette-based features for robust, efficient recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition is vulnerable to viewpoint changes, occlusions, and noise. While multi-modal 3D methods improve robustness, they are often too computationally expensive for real-time use. A lightweight approach that leverages 3D information without full 3D reconstruction is needed.

Method: Introduce 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation reconstructed from 2D silhouettes. Train with supervised losses comparing reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes to ground truth. Extract discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps for efficient fusion, enabling robust gait dynamics capture without heavy RGB-based 3D reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art accuracy, validating the effectiveness of the intermediate 3D heatmap approach and the multi-modal fusion strategy.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait offers a computationally efficient, end-to-end framework that leverages 3D geometry through intermediate heatmaps, achieving high accuracy while avoiding costly full 3D reconstruction; code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [77] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A progressive feature-matching method that leverages feature spatial order to prune candidate matches and improve efficiency, augmented by epipolar geometry and rotation-invariant image alignment, yielding faster and more accurate matching on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature matching remains slow for images with many detected features. Feature spatial order is independent of epipolar geometry and can guide match search to reduce computation and improve robustness.

Method: Build a model of feature spatial order from initial matches; use it to predict spatial ranges for subsequent matches; filter candidates; integrate with epipolar constraints; handle image rotation by aligning via the fundamental matrix; evaluate on standard and synthetic/real datasets.

Result: Experiments show significantly higher efficiency and accuracy than traditional methods, validating the approach across benchmark, simulated, and real-image tests.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial order into progressive matching and aligning with epipolar geometry yields faster, more accurate feature matching and demonstrates potential for scalable matching tasks.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

*Zhao-Yang Wang,Zhimin Shao,Jieneng Chen,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal, multi-task gait analysis framework leveraging 2D silhouettes and 3D SMPL features, fused via a transformer, with multitask learning for gait recognition plus age, BMI, and gender estimation; demonstrates superior performance on challenging BRIAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality gait representations (2D silhouettes or 3D meshes) often fail to capture full geometric and dynamic walking patterns, especially in unconstrained, long-range, or extreme-view scenarios. The work aims to improve recognition robustness and add human attribute estimation.

Method: Integrates 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features; uses a unified transformer to fuse multi-modal gait features; applies multitask learning to jointly perform gait recognition and attribute estimation (age, BMI, gender); evaluated on large-scale BRIAR datasets with long-range distances and extreme pitch angles.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods and provides accurate human attribute estimation under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Multi-modal, multitask learning with transformer-based fusion enhances gait-based identification and human attribute understanding in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

*Kangjian Zhu,Haobo Jiang,Yigong Zhang,Jianjun Qian,Jian Yang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular SE(3) pose estimation via diffusion-based denoising with visibility constraints improves training diversity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited generalization from fixed-scale pose perturbations and lack of robust image-based monocular SE(3) pose estimation.

Method: Two diffusion processes: visibility-constrained pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse denoising process; diffusion perturbs ground-truth poses within camera view; reverse process uses denoising network and posterior sampling with coarse-to-fine refinement; timestep encodes transformation scale.

Result: Improved generalization and robustness; AUC 66.75 on the hardest dataset; 32.3% improvement over SOTA on DREAM and RoboKeyGen.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based, visibility-aware pose estimation with timesteps is effective for image-based monocular pose estimation, yielding stronger performance and generalization.

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

### [80] [Towards Cybersickness Severity Classification from VR Gameplay Videos Using Transfer Learning and Temporal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10422)
*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-based temporal modeling using InceptionV3 features and LSTM predicts cybersickness severity with 68.4% accuracy, addressing the gap where video data alone was underexplored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersickness limits VR adoption. While multimodal sensor approaches exist (eye/head tracking), there is limited work using video-based features for cybersickness prediction. A video-based temporal model could offer a practical, non-intrusive tool for developers to assess and mitigate discomfort.

Method: Apply transfer learning: extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos using InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet. Feed the time-series features into an LSTM to capture temporal dynamics and predict cybersickness severity over time (classification task).

Result: Achieves 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. Outperforms existing models trained solely on video data, suggesting the approach is competitive and practical for VR development.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of video-based temporal modeling for predicting cybersickness and improving user comfort in VR. Lays groundwork for future work in video-based analyses and prompts exploration of multimodal extensions and more diverse VR scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

### [81] [Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426)
*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage retrieval-augmented generation framework (HuLiRAG) that mimics human-like processing to ground multimodal QA on visual referents via what-where-reweight, improving grounding and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often hallucinate due to lack of fine-grained grounding; existing RAG is global and ignores local detail; need human-like anchored reasoning to align queries with specific visual referents.

Method: What: open-vocabulary object detection anchors queries to referents; Where: SAM-derived masks provide spatially precise grounding; Reweight: adaptive local-global alignment to prioritize relational context; Mask-guided fine-tuning injects spatial evidence as constraints in generation.

Result: Empirical results show improved grounding fidelity and factual consistency, reductions in hallucinations, and stronger trustworthy reasoning on multimodal QA tasks.

Conclusion: HuLiRAG demonstrates a scalable, human-like reasoning cascade for MLLMs, potentially generalizable to other multimodal tasks while mitigating hallucinations; further work may address detector reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV presents dense keypoint-level fusion from multi-view RGB to estimate 6D pose of textureless objects without depth data, using a three-stage optimization and symmetry-aware, attentional keypoint network; achieves state-of-the-art among RGB-based multi-view methods and often outperforms RGB-D methods on ROBI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Textureless object pose estimation remains challenging due to depth data loss; existing multi-view RGB methods underutilize geometric cues or rely on depth. There is a need for robust dense keypoint fusion using only RGB across views.

Method: A three-stage progressive pose optimization pipeline (DKPMV) that performs dense keypoint fusion from multi-view RGB. The keypoint network is enhanced with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training to improve accuracy and resolve symmetries. The approach operates purely on RGB data across multiple views.

Result: On ROBI dataset, DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB methods and often surpasses RGB-D methods. The authors report strong improvements across experiments, indicating the effectiveness of dense keypoint fusion and symmetry-aware training.

Conclusion: Dense multi-view RGB pose estimation with attentive, symmetry-aware keypoint fusion and a staged optimization can rival, and in many cases exceed, RGB-D approaches for textureless object 6D pose, highlighting the value of dense multi-view geometric cues and robust keypoint predictions.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDeGraph uses neighbor-burnout to detect and filter consistent anomalies, building an image-level graph to isolate anomalies; this yields strong zero-shot AC/AS performance on MVTec AD across ViT and DINOv2 backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial quality control requires zero-shot anomaly detection and segmentation without labeled defect data. Existing representation-based methods struggle with consistent, recurring anomalies across images, limiting AC/AS performance.

Method: Identify stable normal-patch similarities and abrupt similarity spikes for consistent anomalies (neighbor-burnout). Construct an image-level graph where nodes are images and edges connect images sharing consistent-anomaly patterns; apply community detection to filter anomalies. Provide theoretical grounding via Extreme Value Theory.

Result: On MVTec AD with ViT-L-14-336: AC AUROC 98.3%; AS: F1 66.8% (+4.2%), AP 68.1% (+5.4%). With DINOv2 backbone: F1 69.1% (+6.5%), AP 71.9% (+9.2%). Demonstrates robustness across architectures and surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot methods.

Conclusion: CoDeGraph effectively filters consistent anomalies through a graph-based community-detection approach grounded in Extreme Value Theory, delivering strong zero-shot AC/AS performance and generalizing across backbones.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-rater variability in medical image segmentation arises from differences in annotator expertise and inherent image blurriness; simply averaging labels discards useful clinical uncertainty.

Method: Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns a latent space representing individual annotator styles; Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) samples from this space to generate the final segmentation, mimicking a clinical panel decision.

Result: State-of-the-art Dice scores on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets: 92.11% and 90.72%.

Conclusion: Treat expert disagreement as a useful signal rather than noise, paving the way for more robust and trustworthy AI systems in healthcare.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Public dataset MultiTIPS enables multimodal, multi-task prognosis for TIPS with a robust segmentation framework and superior cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIPS prognosis is challenged by ROI annotation burden, unimodal limitations, and single-endpoint predictions; public data is lacking, hindering progress.

Method: Three-module framework: (1) dual-option segmentation (semi-supervised + foundation-model-based); (2) multimodal interaction (MGRA, POD, CGPE) for cross-modal feature fusion; (3) multi-task prediction with staged training for survival, portal pressure gradient, and OHE; evaluation on MultiTIPS shows improved accuracy and generalization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability; reliable ROI segmentation with limited annotations; provides dataset and code.

Conclusion: MultiTIPS advances TIPS prognosis research by offering a public resource and a robust, interpretable multimodal framework suitable for clinical translation.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The

### [87] [When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10466)
*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Modal Guidance (CMG) is a training-free decoding method that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by degrading visual-language attention to emphasize visual context, improving alignment without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models often hallucinate by exploiting language priors; there is a need for a decoding-time mechanism that mitigates language bias without retraining.

Method: During decoding, CMG adaptively masks the attention weights of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to degrade visual-language perception, then uses the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the degraded-model to guide decoding.

Result: CMG reduces language bias and hallucinations across hallucination-specific benchmarks, improves different VLMs' performance on such benchmarks, and generalizes effectively, all without additional training or cost.

Conclusion: A training-free decoding-time intervention that strengthens visual grounding in VLMs by perturbing visual-context attention, yielding better alignment with images without sacrificing fluency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

*Chuang Chen,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAGLFNet is a real-time pseudo-image-based LiDAR semantic segmentation framework that uses global-local feature fusion, multi-branch extraction, and attention-guided feature fusion to achieve competitive results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently converting unstructured LiDAR point clouds into structured semantic representations while preserving structural and semantic details; existing pseudo-image methods trade discriminability for speed.

Method: Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding to enhance local-to-global relations; Multi-Branch Feature Extraction to capture varied neighborhood information and refine contour features; Deep Feature-guided Attention for cross-channel feature fusion.

Result: Reported validation accuracies of 69.83% on SemanticKITTI and 78.65% on nuScenes, indicating strong accuracy with real-time capability.

Conclusion: The architecture achieves discriminative, robust segmentation with a balance of accuracy and efficiency, showing potential for real-time LiDAR-based applications.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

### [89] [MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10478)
*Deng Li,Jun Shao,Bohao Xing,Rong Gao,Bihan Wen,Heikki Kälviäinen,Xin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba+ introduce motion-aware local spatiotemporal fusion to the Mamba framework, enabling efficient, state-space-based MGR with multiscale fusion and adaptive weighting, achieving state-of-the-art results on two MGR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address MGR's need to model both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local motion; vanilla Mamba is 1D and lacks local modeling; CNNs/Transformers tradeoffs; goal is a lightweight yet accurate model that is motion-aware.

Method: Add motion-aware state fusion module using central frame difference to fuse neighboring states into the Mamba update; extend to multiscale MSF-Mamba+ with adaptive scale weighting to combine information across scales.

Result: MSF-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public MGR datasets, outperforming CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while preserving high efficiency; the lightweight version already SoTA.

Conclusion: Motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling via state fusion effectively captures subtle micro-gestures in MGR; multiscale extension offers flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency; MSF-Mamba family advances MGR modeling over vanilla Mamba.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

### [90] [Towards Self-Refinement of Vision-Language Models with Triangular Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10487)
*Yunlong Deng,Guangyi Chen,Tianpei Gu,Lingjing Kong,Yan Li,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models can self-refine and learn autonomously from unlabeled data by generating and filtering pseudo supervision via a Triangular Consistency principle, yielding consistent but modest gains without external supervision when initialized from LLaVA-1.5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction and whether they can leverage self-generated data for autonomous learning.

Method: Introduce Triangular Consistency within an image-query-answer triangle. Step 1: enable instruction generation via multi-task instruction tuning (image→question-answer; image-answer→question). Step 2: generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and filter using Triangular Consistency. Step 3: update the model with the filtered synthetic data. Supplement with a causal-perspective theoretical analysis. Baseline: LLaVA-1.5; evaluation on multiple benchmarks; code provided.

Result: Experiments show autonomous, consistent improvements across several benchmarks without external supervision; improvements are modest but robust. The approach demonstrates the viability of self-generated supervision in VLMs.

Conclusion: Self-refinement via Triangular Consistency enables VLMs to learn from unlabeled data, offering a path toward reducing reliance on labeled data and stimulating future research on VLM learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

*Jiaye Li,Baoyou Chen,Hui Li,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARoPE: a lightweight head-wise adaptive extension to RoPE that inserts a learnable linear transformation (via SVD) before rotary mapping to enable dynamic frequency allocation, semantic alignment of planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields for image generation. It preserves RoPE's relative-position property and acts as a drop-in replacement with improved performance on image-generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE's standard multi-dimensional, axis-wise independent, and uniformly treated frequency allocation struggles to capture fine-grained spatial relations, color cues, and object counting in 2D image generation, limiting RoPE's effectiveness beyond 1D domains.

Method: Introduce HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that applies a learnable linear transformation (parameterized by SVD) before the rotary mapping. This enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific receptive fields, while preserving RoPE's relative-position property. It remains a lightweight modification suitable as a drop-in replacement.

Result: Empirical evaluation on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image tasks (Flux and MMDiT) shows HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions, validating its effectiveness across diverse image-generation settings.

Conclusion: HARoPE provides a principled, adaptable, and lightweight mechanism to enhance positional awareness in transformer-based image generators, outperforming standard RoPE and serving as an effective drop-in replacement.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

### [92] [Jigsaw3D: Disentangled 3D Style Transfer via Patch Shuffling and Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10497)
*Yuteng Ye,Zheng Zhang,Qinchuan Zhang,Di Wang,Youjia Zhang,Wenxiao Zhang,Wei Yang,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D is a diffusion-based 3D style transfer pipeline that decouples style from content using a jigsaw operation on reference patches, enabling fast, multi-view consistent stylization and texture baking onto the mesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D stylization methods either inject style tokens or distill from 2D diffusion models, which entangles style with content and incurs heavy per-scene optimization or high latency. A clean separation of style and content with view-consistent guidance is needed for faster, more robust 3D stylization.

Method: Apply a jigsaw operation (spatial shuffling and random masking) on reference patches to suppress object semantics and extract stylistic statistics. Use multi-view diffusion with reference-to-view cross-attention to generate view-consistent stylizations conditioned on the input mesh. Bake the style-rendered views onto the surface to obtain seamless textures.

Result: On standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and strong multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and generalizes to masked partial-reference stylization, multi-object scenes, and tileable texture generation.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D demonstrates that decoupling content and style via jigsaw references and cross-attentive diffusion can deliver fast, view-consistent 3D stylization with broad generalization, reducing optimization burden while enabling flexible styling scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

### [94] [Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables for Vision Inference: Advancing from Low-level to High-level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10522)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a LUT-based CNN inference framework that expands receptive field under fixed table size by learning a lattice vector quantizer (LVQ) that allocates quantization resolution adaptively across dimensions. Adds irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT to capture multi-level context, achieving better speed-accuracy-memory tradeoffs than existing LUT methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LUT-based CNN inference methods trade speed for limited receptive field because the LUT size grows combinatorially with kernel size and dimension. The goal is to expand the receptive field without increasing the fixed table size, maintaining space complexity while improving performance.

Method: Introduce a lattice vector quantizer that adaptively assigns quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their importance, yielding more accurate kernel approximations than scalar quantizers. Also propose irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure to capture multi-level contextual information without enlarging the LUT size.

Result: Claims significant improvements over existing LUT methods in speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, due to the expanded receptive field and more accurate kernel approximation while preserving fixed table size.

Conclusion: The approach achieves a favorable balance among speed, accuracy, and memory use for LUT-driven CNN inference and demonstrates the practicality of LVQ-based LUTs combined with receptive-field-expansion techniques.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

TL;DR: COSINE is a unified open-world segmentation model that merges open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation using multi-modal prompts to improve generalization and mask generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge gaps between disparate pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation, which have different architectures, objectives, and representations.

Method: Extract representations from the input image and multi-modal prompts via foundation models; a SegDecoder aligns these representations, models their interaction, and produces masks guided by prompts across multiple granularities.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance gains on both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks; analyses show that combining visual and textual prompts improves generalization beyond single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: COSINE shows that a cross-modal, prompt-guided unified segmentation framework can effectively handle open-world segmentation with improved generalization.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

TL;DR: Pattern-aware ALPR system with a high-precision detector and a transformer-based recognition stage that uses iterative language modeling to jointly optimize visual and linguistic cues, enabling layout-independent recognition across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR faces diverse plate layouts, fonts, noise, and distortion. A unified approach that leverages plate-specific patterns and contextual language cues can improve accuracy without manual layout classification.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: high-precision plate detection followed by a recognition stage that fuses a transformer-based visual model with iterative language modeling. The recognition stage performs character identification and post-OCR refinement, learning formatting rules and patterns directly, without heuristic layout corrections, by jointly optimizing visual and linguistic cues and enabling iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms recent segmentation-free approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. Demonstrates layout-independent recognition across IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP datasets, showing strong generalization to diverse layouts, fonts, and noise.

Conclusion: Bridges computer vision and language modeling within ALPR, enabling adaptable, pattern-aware recognition suitable for intelligent transportation and surveillance across diverse plate layouts.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) framework tackles imbalanced missing modalities in multi-modal learning by jointly enhancing learning dynamics (LCE) and feature representation (RCE), yielding consistent gains across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced missing rates across modalities create a vicious cycle where higher-missing modalities receive fewer updates and degrade feature quality; existing global dataset balancing neglects sample-level modality utility.

Method: MCE has Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) with multi-level factors to adaptively balance modality-specific learning progress, and Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) employing subset prediction and cross-modal completion to improve semantics and robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations.

Conclusion: MCE effectively mitigates missing-modality issues, improving both learning dynamics and representation; code and preprint available and demonstrate practical utility.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal, open dataset (GLOFNet) for monitoring and predicting glacial lake outburst floods, integrating Sentinel-2 imagery, ITS_LIVE glacier velocity, and MODIS LST for Shisper Glacier; with preprocessing and cross-modal harmonization to enable multimodal ML for rare hazard prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods are rare but highly destructive; advancing forecasting requires harmonized, multimodal datasets that combine visual indicators with physical precursors. Prior work focuses on post-event mapping, leaving a gap for predictive datasets and model benchmarking.

Method: Assemble and preprocess three data streams (Sentinel-2, ITS_LIVE velocity, MODIS LST) with cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding; harmonize modalities for joint analysis; provide a baseline exploratory analysis of dynamics.

Result: GLOFNet dataset assembled and publicly released, enabling multimodal deep learning for rare hazard prediction. Exploratory findings show seasonal glacier velocity cycles, a long-term warming trend (~0.8 K per decade), and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions; the dataset addresses issues like class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution.

Conclusion: GLOFNet fills a critical gap by providing a structured, multimodal resource for benchmarking predictive models of GLOFs, promoting reproducibility and collaboration in rare hazard forecasting and enabling future research in glacial hazard prediction.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

TL;DR: An enhanced MRS-YOLO for railway line foreign object detection that integrates a multi-scale adaptive kernel feature fusion and a recalibration fusion pyramid neck with a specialized detection head, plus channel pruning for efficiency, yielding higher accuracy with notably reduced parameters and FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address missed detections, false alarms, and low detection efficiency in detecting foreign objects on transmission lines within railway environments.

Method: Incorporates MAKDF within C3k2 to form C3k2_MAKDF for improved multi-scale feature extraction; introduces a Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (RCFPN) as the neck for better multi-level feature fusion; develops a Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) to enhance detection; applies channel pruning to reduce model size and computational cost (Parameters and GFLOPs).

Result: On the MRS-YOLO model, mAP50 reaches 94.8% and mAP50:95 reaches 86.4%, each improving by 0.7 and 2.3 percentage points over the baseline, respectively. Parameters and GFLOPs decrease by 44.2% and 17.5%. These gains demonstrate improved foreign object detection performance and efficiency for railway transmission line applications.

Conclusion: The proposed MRS-YOLO architecture effectively boosts detection accuracy for foreign objects in railway environments while significantly reducing model complexity, making it more suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection

Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

### [100] [Deep semi-supervised approach based on consistency regularization and similarity learning for weeds classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10573)
*Farouq Benchallal,Adel Hafiane,Nicolas Ragot,Raphael Canals*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning method combining consistency regularization and similarity learning with a deep auto-encoder improves weed species classification under label scarcity and noisy conditions, outperforming fully supervised baselines on DeepWeeds with ablation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high labeling cost and variability in weed images; leverage unlabeled data to improve robustness of weed classification in precision agriculture.

Method: Proposes a deep semi-supervised framework that integrates consistency regularization with similarity learning, implemented via a deep auto-encoder architecture; trained on labeled and unlabeled data; evaluated on DeepWeeds; includes ablation studies.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness and robustness versus state-of-the-art fully supervised models on DeepWeeds under noisy conditions; ablation studies reveal contributions of the joint learning components.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised joint learning with consistency and similarity objectives improves weed classification under data scarcity and noise, aiding robust automated precision agriculture; future work could extend to other datasets and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

### [101] [UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10575)
*Zhengrong Yue,Haiyu Zhang,Xiangyu Zeng,Boyu Chen,Chenting Wang,Shaobin Zhuang,Lu Dong,KunPeng Du,Yi Wang,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFlow is a generic, unified tokenizer for vision that harmonizes understanding and generation by adapting pretrained visual encoders with layer-wise adaptive self-distillation and a patch-wise pixel flow decoder, achieving strong performance across 13 benchmarks (7 tasks) and outperforming larger baselines on understanding while remaining competitive in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conflict between high-level semantic understanding and low-level pixel reconstruction in existing tokenizers prevents a single tokenizer from excelling at both understanding and generation. A universal tokenizer is needed to bridge this gap without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: - Apply layer-wise adaptive self-distillation to pretrained visual encoders to retain strong semantic features while enabling fine-grained detail adaptation. - Introduce a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder that constructs high-fidelity pixel reconstructions by modeling a conditional flow from noisy to patch-wise pixel space, guided by semantic features as decoder conditions. - Employ patch-wise learning to simplify data distribution and improve training efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 benchmarks on 7 tasks show UniFlow achieves a win-win between understanding and generation. The 7B UniFlow-XL outperforms 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks and reaches competitive scores in reconstruction and generation, beating UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without guidance).

Conclusion: UniFlow demonstrates that a generic, unified tokenizer can simultaneously preserve semantic understanding and enable high-quality visual generation when built with adaptive self-distillation and a patch-wise flow decoder, offering improved efficiency and broad applicability across vision tasks.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

### [102] [Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577)
*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-ABFlow uses diffusion models to map noisy optical-flow estimates to clean flows by fusing frame-based appearance with event-based boundary information, addressing degradation in high-speed/low-light scenes where traditional appearance cues fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In degraded capture conditions, frame appearance features weaken and hamper discriminative models; event cameras offer complementary boundary information but not full appearance cues, causing boundary-full but appearance-poor data. A diffusion-based approach could learn robust mappings from noisy to clean flows independent of deteriorated visuals.

Method: Introduce Diff-ABFlow, a diffusion-model-based framework that fuses frame and event data for appearance-boundary information; train a denoising diffusion model to convert noised flow into clean flow, leveraging both modalities.

Result: The abstract does not provide empirical results; expected to demonstrate improved robustness to motion blur and low light, outperforming frame-only or simple fusion baselines on degraded sequences.

Conclusion: Diff-ABFlow represents a principled diffusion-based solution that capitalizes on frame-event appearance-boundary fusion to enhance optical flow under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

### [103] [Equipping Vision Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10584)
*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision foundations (notably DINOv2) already offer highly discriminative features for OOD detection without fine-tuning, and surprisingly rival SOTA. To address large semantic spaces, the paper introduces Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) and Dynamic-β Mixup, which substantially improve performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection with vision foundation models and the underexplored impact of pre-trained features. The authors aim to understand how pre-trained features contribute to OOD detection and to address optimization challenges that arise when the semantic space is large.

Method: Systematic evaluation of representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Analysis of fine-tuning on in-domain data. Introduction of Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) that partitions features into subspaces to better capture complex data distributions, and Dynamic-β Mixup that samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution to adapt to category difficulty. Extensive experiments showing effectiveness against baselines.

Result: A pre-trained DINOv2 model provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection without ID fine-tuning, achieving performance on par with SOTA. Fine-tuning helps but struggles in large semantic spaces. The MoFE module and Dynamic-β Mixup strategy significantly improve OOD detection, outperforming strong baselines across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models offer strong OOD detection capabilities even without fine-tuning. When faced with many categories, simple fine-tuning is insufficient, but the proposed MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup mitigate optimization challenges and boost performance, delivering substantial gains over baselines.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

### [104] [A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10587)
*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSVG is a feature-selection based baseline for visual grounding that eliminates iterative multi-scale processing by directly integrating language guidance with visual features, using a similarity-based selection to focus on language-related visual features, achieving a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead in text-conditioned visual grounding, which often relies on iterative, multi-scale processing and heavy caching of linguistic and visual features.

Method: A single architecture that jointly encodes language and vision without iterative sweeps. Language acts as a parallel guiding signal to enhance interaction between modalities, while a similarity-based feature selection mechanism prunes features to retain language-relevant visual information.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that FSVG achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods; code is available at the given GitHub repository.

Conclusion: FSVG offers a simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding by combining direct language-vision interaction with feature selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

### [105] [ViSurf: Visual Supervised-and-Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Large Vision-and-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10606)
*Yuqi Liu,Liangyu Chen,Jiazhen Liu,Mingkang Zhu,Zhisheng Zhong,Bei Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf is a unified LVLM post-training paradigm that combines SFT and RLVR in a single stage by injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts and employing three reward-control strategies, achieving superior performance over SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT→RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT can underperform by over-reliance on external guidance, while RLVR can fail when tasks surpass the model's internal knowledge. A unified approach aims to leverage the strengths of both paradigms in one stage to improve LVLM performance and stability.

Method: Derive the ViSurf objective from SFT and RLVR formulations, implement a single-stage post-training method that injects ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts, and introduce three novel reward-control strategies to stabilize and optimize training.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show ViSurf outperforms individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT→RLVR; ablations and analyses validate the derivation and design principles.

Conclusion: ViSurf provides a unified perspective and practical mechanism to integrate external supervision and internal reinforcement in LVLM post-training, delivering superior performance and offering guidance for designing single-stage post-training frameworks.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

### [106] [OmniQuality-R: Advancing Reward Models Through All-Encompassing Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10609)
*Yiting Lu,Fengbin Guan,Yixin Gao,Yan Zhong,Xinge Peng,Jiakang Yuan,Yihao Liu,Bo Zhang,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R introduces a unified reward modeling framework for multi-task visual quality assessment, turning multi-dimensional reasoning into continuous reward signals for policy optimization. It builds a CoT-based SFT dataset, uses GRPO with Gaussian rewards, and applies STD filtering and entropy gating to stabilize RL, evaluated on aesthetic quality, technical quality, and text–image alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual evaluation is typically task-specific, limiting holistic multi-task quality reasoning. A unified, interpretable reward signal could enable policy optimization across diverse IQA tasks.

Method: 1) Build a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset via rejection sampling to create a chain-of-thought-like supervised dataset for fine-tuning. 2) Use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a Gaussian reward for continuous score prediction during post-training. 3) Apply STD filtering and entropy gating to stabilize training and reduce variance during RL. 4) Evaluate on three IQA tasks: aesthetic quality, technical quality, and text-image alignment.

Result: OmniQuality-R is evaluated on three key IQA tasks, demonstrating the framework’s applicability to multi-task quality reasoning with continuous reward signals and improved training stability.

Conclusion: A unified, interpretable multi-task reward modeling framework enables continuous scoring and robust policy optimization across diverse IQA tasks, with stabilized RL and potential for better generalization.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

### [107] [GraphTARIF: Linear Graph Transformer with Augmented Rank and Improved Focus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631)
*Zhaolin Hu,Kun Li,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid linear-attention Graph Transformer that boosts expressiveness by (1) attaching a gated local graph network to the value path to raise the attention map's rank, and (2) introducing a learnable log-power function on attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus, achieving competitive performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs while maintaining linear-time scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention in Graph Transformers provides efficiency but often sacrifices expressiveness due to low-rank projections and overly uniform attention, which harms class separability. A scalable method that preserves discriminative power is needed.

Method: Introduce a hybrid framework: (i) attach a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix to increase the rank of the attention map, and (ii) apply a learnable log-power function to attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. Theoretical analysis shows improved separability of embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances both the rank and focus of attention, improving the separability of learned embeddings without sacrificing linear-time complexity, suggesting broad applicability for graph transformers across graph regimes.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

### [108] [DEMO: Disentangled Motion Latent Flow Matching for Fine-Grained Controllable Talking Portrait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10650)
*Peiyin Chen,Zhuowei Yang,Hui Feng,Sheng Jiang,Rui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEMO is a flow-based, disentangled, audio-driven talking-head generation framework that uses a motion auto-encoder to independently model lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze, followed by OT-based flow matching and a transformer predictor for temporally smooth motion conditioned on audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based talking-head methods struggle with temporal coherence and fine-grained, controllable motion. There is a need for a structured latent space where motion factors are disentangled and approximately orthogonal to enable precise control of lip-sync, head pose, and gaze.

Method: Train a motion auto-encoder to create a structured, approximately orthogonal latent space for motion factors; apply optimal-transport-based flow matching on this space with a transformer predictor to generate temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple benchmarks shows DEMO surpasses prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity.

Conclusion: Disentangled motion representation together with flow-based generative modeling provides a scalable and controllable framework for talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

### [109] [A Machine Learning Perspective on Automated Driving Corner Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10653)
*Sebastian Schmidt,Julius Körner,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a distribution-aware framework for corner-case recognition in perception that unifies taxonomies, improves detection on benchmarks, and enables analysis of complex corner cases with a fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes systems require safe operation. Traditional corner-case handling is manual and scalable-limited, lacking a data-coverage perspective that accounts for the underlying data distribution and generalization to training data.

Method: Introduces a novel machine learning approach framed around data distribution to perform corner-case recognition on a per-sample basis. Unifies existing corner-case taxonomies under a distributional view, extends out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and introduces a fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset to study combined corner cases.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on corner-case detection across standard benchmarks, extends benchmarks with distributional considerations, and enables analysis of combined corner cases via the fog-augmented dataset.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, manual-specification-free foundation for corner-case recognition and highlights the benefits of a distributional perspective for safe perception in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

*Hao Shan,Ruikai Li,Han Jiang,Yizhe Fan,Ziyang Yan,Bohan Li,Xiaoshuai Hao,Hao Zhao,Zhiyong Cui,Yilong Ren,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark for temporal stability in online HD mapping, introducing Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability metrics aggregated into a mean Average Stability (mAS) score; shows stability and accuracy are largely independent and provides design guidance; public benchmark to follow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online HD map accuracy fluctuates due to sensor displacement in dynamic driving scenarios. Existing work focuses on per-frame accuracy and neglects temporal stability, which is crucial for reliable downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes a multi-dimensional stability framework with Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability metrics, aggregated into mAS. Conducts extensive experiments on 42 models/variants to analyze how architectural and training choices impact both accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS). Provides a benchmark toolkit and intends to release public data/models.

Result: Findings suggest that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) are largely independent performance dimensions. The study identifies architectural and training factors that can boost either metric or both, offering insights into how to design more stable online HD mapping systems.

Conclusion: Temporal stability should be treated as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy. The work lays the groundwork for more reliable autonomous driving by providing a public benchmark and analysis of factors influencing stability.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

### [111] [Scalable Face Security Vision Foundation Model for Deepfake, Diffusion, and Spoofing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10663)
*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VFM is a self-supervised pre-training framework for real-face representations that combines masked image modeling and instance discrimination via CRFR-P masking and a self-distillation mechanism, enabling ViT-based universal face foundation models for cross-dataset/domain face security tasks; it introduces FS-Adapter for efficient transfer with competitive results across 11 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain needs robust, transferable facial representations learned from abundant unlabeled real faces to generalize across diverse face security tasks (e.g., cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain anti-spoofing, unseen diffusion facial forensics). Existing approaches struggle with cross-task generalization and rely on labeled data or task-specific designs.

Method: Three learning objectives (3C): combine masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID); design CRFR-P masking to promote intra-region consistency and inter-region coherency; a self-distillation mechanism coupling MIM and ID to learn local-to-global correspondence; pre-train vanilla Vision Transformers (ViTs) as universal Face Foundation Models; propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight bottleneck on top of the frozen backbone with a real-anchor contrastive objective for efficient transfer.

Result: On 11 public benchmarks, FS-VFM generalizes better than diverse vision foundation models across natural and facial domains and across fully/weakly/self-supervised paradigms and model scales; it even outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods; FS-Adapter provides favorable efficiency-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: FS-VFM yields universal facial foundation models capable of robust cross-dataset/domain face security performance; the approach, along with FS-Adapter, offers effective transfer with high efficiency, and code/models are publicly available.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

*Yu Li,Menghan Xia,Gongye Liu,Jianhong Bai,Xintao Wang,Conglang Zhang,Yuxuan Lin,Ruihang Chu,Pengfei Wan,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage approach adapts pre-trained text-to-video models to predict camera viewpoints from 4D scenes by injecting scene content and applying a diffusion-based extrinsic denoising, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage video generation priors to enable implicit world models for viewpoint planning in dynamic 4D scenes; natural viewpoints accompany videos, enabling learned priors for viewpoint prediction.

Method: Stage 1: inject 4D scene representation into T2V via an adaptive learning branch; 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic; conditional generated video embeds viewpoints visually. Stage 2: add a camera extrinsic diffusion branch to the T2V model to perform viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided denoising process, using the generated video and 4D scene as inputs.

Result: Experimental results show superiority over existing competitors; ablations validate effectiveness of key components.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of video generation models to support 4D interaction and viewpoint planning in real-world scenarios; suggests path for integrating video priors into 4D understanding.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey that analyzes image-to-video transfer learning using Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM). It classifies transfer strategies into frozen features vs modified features, surveys tasks from fine-grained to coarse-grained video understanding, includes experimental analyses, and provides a roadmap with challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-Language Foundation Models excel at image-text tasks, and extending them to video can reduce the data and compute needed to build video-language models from scratch. There is a need for a structured, comprehensive review of image-to-video transfer learning strategies and their effectiveness.

Method: Systematic literature review that (1) summarizes widely used ILFM, (2) classifies image-to-video transfer strategies into two categories (frozen features and modified features), (3) elaborates these strategies across a range of video-text tasks, (4) conducts detailed experimental analyses to compare paradigms, and (5) discusses challenges and future directions.

Result: Provides a comprehensive, structured overview of image-to-video transfer learning from ILFM, including taxonomy, task coverage from fine-grained to coarse-grained videos, empirical insights on different transfer paradigms, and actionable guidance for researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: The survey offers a roadmap for advancing video-text learning using existing ILFM, highlights key challenges, and suggests promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Yuxiang Luo,Qing Xu,Hai Huang,Yuqi Ouyang,Zhen Chen,Wenting Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSM-Seg introduces a dual-memory segmentation framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation that uses cross-modal and inter-slice information with a category-agnostic prompt. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MRI datasets through MSMA, MCP-Encoder, and MF-Decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt-based segmentation methods for brain tumors rely on labor-intensive, category-specific prompts and often ignore cross-modal correlations and inter-slice context, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: MSM-Seg employs a dual-memory segmentation paradigm: (1) modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to capture cross-modal and inter-slice relations; (2) multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide guidance for decoding without category-specific prompts; (3) modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) to fuse decoding information across modalities. The framework integrates multi-modal MRI data with efficient prompts to guide segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on various MRI datasets show MSM-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed MSM-Seg framework effectively leverages cross-modal and inter-slice information with category-agnostic prompts to improve brain tumor segmentation accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

*Xinyu Yang,Zheheng Jiang,Feixiang Zhou,Yihang Zhu,Na Lv,Nan Xing,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes State-Specific Model (SSM) to unify action detection and anticipation by compressing untrimmed video to critical states, learning action dynamics via a multi-edge state-transition graph, and using cross-temporal interactions to incorporate intention, achieving strong results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untrimmed videos contain substantial redundancy and noise; current action understanding often overlooks the agent's intention. A unified model that captures both action dynamics and intention could improve both detection and anticipation.

Method: 1) Critical State-Based Memory Compression to shorten frame sequences into key states; 2) Action Pattern Learning with a multi-dimensional-edge state-transition graph to model action dynamics and generate potential future cues reflecting intention; 3) Cross-Temporal Interaction to model mutual influence between past/present information and intentions, enabling simultaneous detection and anticipation.

Result: Extensive experiments on EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and the PDMB dataset show the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the value of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions.

Conclusion: SSM effectively unifies detection and anticipation by focusing on critical states, modeling dynamics via a state-transition graph, and integrating intention through cross-temporal interactions, thus guiding future action-understanding research.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

### [116] [Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Defocused and Motion-blurred Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10691)
*Xuankai Zhang,Junjin Xiao,Qing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, per-pixel blur-aware framework enabling high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos for photorealistic novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defocus blur and motion blur arise from different formation processes; existing methods usually handle only one type and struggle with joint modeling. Estimating accurate blur kernels is hard, limiting joint approaches.

Method: Propose a blur prediction network to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using blur-related scene and camera cues under a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Introduce dynamic Gaussian densification to address missing Gaussians in incomplete regions. Leverage unseen view information during optimization to constrain the scene and improve novel-view synthesis in a unified framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for photorealistic novel-view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Code and trained models will be publicly released.

Conclusion: A unified, blur-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework effectively handles both defocus and motion blur, enabling robust novel-view synthesis from monocular videos and offering a practical path toward versatile video-to-3D reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldMirror is a unified feed-forward model that ingests diverse geometric priors (camera poses, intrinsics, depth) and jointly predicts multiple 3D representations (dense point clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D Gaussians) in a single forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art across a range of 3D tasks with efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D methods are often constrained to image-only inputs or tailored to a single task, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies. A unified framework that can leverage available priors and produce geometrically consistent outputs across multiple representations is desirable.

Method: A single architecture that flexibly integrates priors such as camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps, and outputs multiple 3D representations (dense point clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, normals, and 3D Gaussians) in a single forward pass. The approach implies multi-task, multi-output, feed-forward design with shared representations and task-specific heads.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks spanning camera estimation, point map estimation, depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, along with the efficiency of feed-forward inference.

Conclusion: WorldMirror offers a versatile, efficient all-in-one solution for 3D geometry prediction by effectively leveraging available priors to produce consistent, multi-representations in one forward pass; code/models to be released.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates
diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps,
while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,
depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining
the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly

TL;DR: A hierarchical, intention-aware framework predicts fine-grained VR/AR user behaviors by modeling cognitive intentions and interactions with the environment, using a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network to forecast gaze and actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve VR/AR adaptivity by accurately modeling the cognitive processes behind human-environment interactions, enabling proactive, personalized responses and more natural user experiences.

Method: Develop a hierarchical, intention-aware model that uses historical user dynamics and scene context to identify potential interaction targets and forecast detailed future behaviors. It employs a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture human-environment relationships and predicts gaze direction and object interactions.

Result: Experimental evaluation on challenging real-world benchmarks and live VR environments shows superior performance across metrics, validating the framework's ability to anticipate user behaviors and support proactive VR adaptation.

Conclusion: Incorporating cognitive-inspired mechanisms and a dynamic GCN enables accurate prediction of detailed situated behaviors, facilitating responsive VR/AR systems and practical proactive applications.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

*Laura Weihl,Nejc Novak,Stefan H. Bengtson,Malte Pedersen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark for underwater visual anomaly detection (VAD); reveals VAD performance is highly sensitive to training data and scene variability, and that soft/consensus labels improve reliability for scalable biodiversity monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual review of vast underwater footage is infeasible; automatic detection of anomalous events is needed to efficiently monitor marine biodiversity.

Method: Proposes AURA dataset with multiple annotators; evaluates four VAD models across two marine scenes; analyzes frame selection strategies; compares model outputs to annotations, emphasizing soft and consensus labeling.

Result: VAD performance varies dramatically across models and is highly affected by training data quantity and the variability of what constitutes 'normal' scenes; consensus and soft labels help stabilize performance and provide practical workflows for monitoring.

Conclusion: VAD can support scalable underwater biodiversity monitoring, but reliability hinges on labeling quality and data diversity. Soft/consensus labeling and robust frame selection are key to practical deployment.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

### [120] [Restricted Receptive Fields for Face Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10753)
*Kagan Ozturk,Aman Bhatta,Haiyu Wu,Patrick Flynn,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locally additive, patch-based face similarity metric enabling inherently interpretable decisions; maintains competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for interpretable models and reliable evaluation of post-hoc explanations in computer vision. The paper proposes an inherently interpretable approach to face similarity by decomposing decisions into patch-level contributions, addressing the limitations of post-hoc methods.

Method: Define face similarity as the sum of patch-level similarity scores computed over restricted receptive fields within 112x112 face images, with patch sizes of 28x28 and 56x56 to provide locally additive explanations without post-hoc analysis.

Result: Achieves competitive verification performance using 28x28 patches and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: An inherently interpretable model is achieved through a patch-based, locally additive similarity measure; this provides explanations without post-hoc analysis and maintains strong performance, especially at larger patch sizes.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

TL;DR: EGD-YOLOv8n is a lightweight multi-spectral detector for drones and birds using RGB, IR, and fused data (VIP CUP 2025). It enhances feature extraction with attention and a specialized detection head for scale variation, achieving real-time performance on common GPUs, with the fusion model performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safely and securely separate drones from birds while enabling real-time detection. The VIP CUP 2025 dataset provides both RGB and infrared imagery, enabling multispectral fusion to improve robustness and accuracy in varied conditions.

Method: EGD-YOLOv8n is a lightweight YOLOv8n-based detector with enhanced feature-capture blocks and attention layers, plus a specialized detection head to handle objects across scales.

Conclusion: A multi-spectral fusion approach with a lightweight detector can effectively detect drones and birds in RGB and IR imagery, with fusion offering the strongest performance. This supports deployment in real-world airspace monitoring with potential for further refinement.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 2.5D graph-based framework for 3D chest CT multi-label classification using axial slice triplets as nodes with spectral graph convolution to capture inter-slice dependencies, achieving strong cross-dataset generalization and competitive performance with SOTA encoders, with ablations and transfer experiments indicating broader applicability to tasks like report generation and abdominal CT; extends MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated CT tools are increasingly needed to manage radiologist workload. Multi-label classification on 3D chest CT is challenging due to complex spatial relationships and variability of abnormalities. 3D CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies; Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training. A lightweight, generalizable approach that captures inter-slice dependencies efficiently is desirable.

Method: Represent 3D CT volumes as structured graphs where axial slice triplets form nodes. Apply spectral graph convolution to reason over inter-slice dependencies. Explore aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Train and evaluate on three independent datasets to assess cross-dataset generalization. Conduct ablation studies. Demonstrate transferability to automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Result: The method achieves strong cross-dataset generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. Ablation studies clarify the impact of aggregation methods, edge weighting, and connectivity. Transfer experiments indicate broader applicability beyond chest CT tasks.

Conclusion: A 2.5D graph-based representation is effective for 3D chest CT multi-label classification, balancing performance with deployment-ready efficiency, and generalizes well across datasets; the work extends prior MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop contributions.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

*Sneha Varur,Anirudh R Hanchinamani,Tarun S Bagewadi,Uma Mudenagudi,Chaitra D Desai,Sujata C,Padmashree Desai,Sumit Meharwade*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A disentangled style-content GAN (DISC-GAN) for photorealistic underwater image synthesis using K-means style clustering and per-cluster training with separate style/content encoders and AdaIN, achieving SSIM 0.9012, PSNR 32.51 dB, FID 13.37.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging suffers from optical effects (color attenuation, turbidity) that vary across waterbodies. These non-uniform conditions create distinct style domains; a model must capture style-content disentanglement across these domains to synthesize realistic underwater images.

Method: Two encoders extract latent style and content representations; Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) fuses them. K-means clusters the dataset into style-specific domains. The model is trained independently on each cluster; a decoder generates the final image.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art metrics: SSIM 0.9012, PSNR 32.5118 dB, FID 13.3728.

Conclusion: The proposed DISC-GAN effectively models style variations in underwater environments via style-content disentanglement and cluster-specific training, improving photorealistic underwater synthesis. Nonetheless, cluster choice and cross-cluster generalization warrant further ablations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Motivation: Traditional 3D morphable models are constrained by fixed topology and linearity, limiting complex full-head shapes. Deep implicit functions offer flexible, high-fidelity modeling, but scalable, editable head representations with localized control are still needed.

Method: Propose imHead, an implicit 3DMM that keeps a compact global identity latent and adds region-specific latent representations to enable localized edits. Train on a large-scale dataset of 4K identities, enabling scalable 3D head modeling with editable regions.

Result: Demonstrates strong expressive power to represent diverse identities and expressions, outperforming prior approaches, and provides an interpretable mechanism for localized facial edits.

Conclusion: imHead offers a scalable, expressive, and editable implicit 3D head model, advancing the ability to model and manipulate 3D heads with region-wise control.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

### [125] [Full segmentation annotations of 3D time-lapse microscopy images of MDA231 cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10797)
*Aleksandra Melnikova,Petr Matula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations for migrating cells, with validation against existing markers and 2D gold truth; dataset and experiments described beyond the earlier paper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality segmentation annotations for volumetric/time-resolved data are scarce and costly to produce; enabling robust training, testing, and analysis of dynamic 3D cellular shapes.

Method: Three human annotators labeled two sequences of MDA231 breast carcinoma cells (CTC dataset); validated 3D annotations against CTC tracking markers and 2D gold truth; compared with automatically generated silver truth; assessed inter-annotator variability; detailed dataset description and experiments not in the earlier paper.

Result: 3D annotations are consistent with tracking markers; segmentation accuracy falls within inter-annotator variability margins; annotations better capture input image complexity than silver truth; dataset is suitable for testing/training cell segmentation and 3D shape analysis of dynamic objects.

Conclusion: Provides a public resource for 3D time-lapse cell segmentation annotation; first of its kind; enables improved testing, training, and analysis of dynamic 3D cellular structures.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSCloudCAM is a cross-attention, multi-scale network for multispectral cloud segmentation (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for four classes (clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, cloud shadow).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds hinder optical satellite analysis; robust, scale-aware, multisensor cloud segmentation is needed for reliable environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research.

Method: A Swin Transformer backbone with ASPP/PSP multi-scale context modules; a Cross-Attention block for multisensor/multispectral feature fusion; Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module for adaptive refinement; outputs four semantic categories.

Result: On CloudSEN12 and L8Biome benchmarks, MSCloudCAM achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baselines while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM is effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

### [127] [From Detection to Mitigation: Addressing Bias in Deep Learning Models for Chest X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10822)
*Clemence Mottez,Louisa Fay,Maya Varma,Sophie Ostmeier,Curtis Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bias detection and mitigation framework for chest X-ray diagnosis using a CNN-XGBoost adapter improves fairness across sex, age, and race without sacrificing accuracy; it is model-agnostic, data-efficient, and scalable, outperforming traditional bias mitigation methods in many cases, especially when combined with active learning on CheXpert and MIMIC datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address healthcare disparities arising from demographic-dependent performance in deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnostics by developing a practical, scalable bias mitigation approach that preserves accuracy.

Method: Extend a CNN-XGBoost pipeline to multi-label classification; replace the CNN final layer with an XGBoost classifier; evaluate on DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50 backbones; compare against adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning; apply retraining of XGBoost plus active learning; test on four medical conditions; assess fairness across sex, age, and race; validate on CheXpert and MIMIC datasets.

Result: Replacing the final CNN layer with an XGBoost classifier improves fairness across demographic subgroups while maintaining or improving overall predictive performance; the approach is model-agnostic (works with DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50) and offers competitive or superior bias reduction with lower computational cost compared to traditional bias mitigation techniques; combining XGBoost retraining with active learning yields the largest bias reduction across all subgroups and distribution settings.

Conclusion: A practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology, via a lightweight, model-agnostic bias mitigation strategy that scales across backbones and outperforms traditional methods, particularly when coupled with active learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

### [128] [FastHMR: Accelerating Human Mesh Recovery via Token and Layer Merging with Diffusion Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10868)
*Soroush Mehraban,Andrea Iaboni,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces two HMR-specific merging strategies, ECLM and Mask-ToMe, plus a diffusion-based decoder to reduce compute while maintaining or improving accuracy, achieving up to 2.3x speed-up on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based 3D HMR models achieve strong accuracy but incur high computational cost due to deep architectures and redundant tokens; there is a need to reduce complexity without sacrificing performance.

Method: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) selectively merges transformer layers with minimal impact on MPJPE. Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe) merges background tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. A diffusion-based decoder is introduced to incorporate temporal context and leverage pose priors learned from large-scale motion capture datasets.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show up to 2.3x speed-up with performance that slightly improves over the baseline.

Conclusion: Efficient HMR is attainable by combining targeted layer/token merging with a diffusion-based decoder that leverages temporal context and pose priors, offering practical gains in speed without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

### [129] [rareboost3d: a synthetic lidar dataset with enhanced rare classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10876)
*Shutong Lin,Zhengkang Xiang,Jianzhong Qi,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareBoost3D introduces a synthetic point cloud dataset to alleviate long-tail issues in LiDAR segmentation by providing more instances of rare classes, and uses a cross-domain semantic alignment loss (CSC loss) to align class features across synthetic and real domains, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tail class imbalance in real-world LiDAR datasets leads to poor performance on rare object classes. Synthetic data can augment real data to provide more instances of rare classes. A cross-domain alignment mechanism is needed to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real data.

Method: - Propose RareBoost3D, a synthetic LiDAR point cloud dataset to increase rare-class instances. - Propose CSC loss that encourages feature representations of the same class to be aligned across synthetic and real domains during segmentation training.

Result: Experimental results show that applying CSC loss to align domain-specific features improves LiDAR point cloud segmentation performance when training with both synthetic and real data compared to using real data alone.

Conclusion: Combining synthetic data with a cross-domain feature alignment loss effectively mitigates long-tail problems in LiDAR perception, improving segmentation performance and suggesting broader applicability to other cross-domain vision tasks.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

### [130] [Where on Earth? A Vision-Language Benchmark for Probing Model Geolocation Skills Across Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10880)
*Zhaofang Qian,Hardy Chen,Zeyu Wang,Li Zhang,Zijun Wang,Xiaoke Huang,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Zeyu Zheng,Haoqin Tu,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthWhere introduces a comprehensive VLM geolocation benchmark with 810 global images across two scales (WhereCountry and WhereStreet), evaluating final location accuracy, textual localization, and intermediate reasoning via human-verified clues and Shapley-based crediting. It benchmarks 13 VLMs, finding Gemini-2.5-Pro strongest (56.32% avg) and GLM-4.5V best open-weight (34.71%), while highlighting biases and the limited gains from web search when visual clues are scarce; the dataset is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in evaluating vision-language models on image-grounded geolocation under open-world, real-world conditions. Existing benchmarks often focus on final accuracy without examining intermediate reasoning, evidence use, or bias robustness. EarthWhere aims to provide a holistic, multi-faceted evaluation to push robust, explainable geolocation capabilities.

Method: Construct EarthWhere with 810 globally distributed images split into WhereCountry (500 MCQ country-level with panoramas) and WhereStreet (310 fine-grained street-level, multi-step reasoning with optional web search). Use final-prediction metrics (Acc@k for coordinates; hierarchical path scores for textual localization) and introduce intermediate reasoning scoring via human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score to quantify clue contribution. Benchmark 13 SOTA VLMs with web search tools.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average accuracy at 56.32% across tasks. GLM-4.5V is the strongest open-weight model with 34.71% average accuracy. Web search and reasoning do not universally boost performance when visual cues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases, achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in some regions than others.

Conclusion: EarthWhere provides a rigorous, multi-faceted benchmark for open-world image geolocation, highlighting both the promise and challenges of VLMs in robust, fine-grained localization. The benchmark is open-source, enabling community evaluation and progress toward bias-mitigated, reasoning-enabled geolocation models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP: a topology-aware multilingual CLIP using persistent homology to align cross-modal embedding spaces, preserving global topology, yielding better multilingual coherence and zero-shot/multilingual retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models exhibit English-centric bias due to limited multilingual multimodal data and existing multilingual extensions emphasize instance-level alignment, neglecting global geometric structure of the shared embedding space.

Method: Introduce ToMCLIP with topology-preserving constraints. Use persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximate the persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds via graph sparsification. Validate on multilingual and zero-shot tasks (e.g., CIFAR-100, xFlickr&CO).

Result: Improved structural coherence of multilingual representations; higher zero-shot accuracy on CIFAR-100; stronger multilingual retrieval on xFlickr&CO.

Conclusion: Topology-aware alignment is a promising general approach for representation learning beyond vision-language models, enabling incorporation of topological constraints into multilingual, multimodal representations.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

### [132] [SceneTextStylizer: A Training-Free Scene Text Style Transfer Framework with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10910)
*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion-based framework, SceneTextStylizer, enables prompt-guided, region-aware, high-fidelity style transfer for text in scene images, preserving readability while enriching style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localized style editing for scene text is underdeveloped; existing methods focus on global transfer or content replacement and fail to balance style flexibility with text readability.

Method: Proposes SceneTextStylizer: a training-free diffusion-based framework with a feature injection module using diffusion model inversion and self-attention for style transfer; a region control mechanism using a distance-based changing mask at each denoising step for spatial control; a Fourier-based style enhancement module to boost stylistic richness.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming state-of-the-art in visual fidelity and text preservation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that flexible, high-fidelity, prompt-guided text style transfer in scenes is achievable without training, with strong readability preservation and stylistic consistency; supports broader adoption for text-aware image editing.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

Conclusion: DreamMakup provides improved customization with identity preservation and controllability in a training-free diffusion framework, offering a practical, scalable solution for real-image makeup editing and seamless integration with text-based guidance.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled
advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2 advances bilingual fine-grained vision-language alignment for English and Chinese, using region-text supervision, long-caption modeling, and a Textual Intra-modal Contrastive loss, trained on mixed EN/ZH data, achieving SOTA across 29 datasets/8 tasks, and accompanied by a new Chinese benchmark and released resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) excel at global alignment but struggle with fine-grained attributes, spatial relations, linguistic expressions, and limited bilingual/fine-grained support. There is a need for bilingual models capable of fine-grained alignment to support non-English settings.

Method: Proposes FG-CLIP 2: a bilingual vision-language model that leverages fine-grained supervision (region-text matching, long-caption modeling) and multiple discriminative objectives. Introduces Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data.

Result: FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance and state-of-the-art results in both English and Chinese. Evaluated on 29 datasets across 8 tasks, with strong performance on long-caption retrieval and bounding-box classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2 effectively improves bilingual fine-grained alignment and provides a robust benchmark suite and resources to advance multilingual vision-language research.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

### [135] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An instance-level, calibration-free uncertainty indicator detects distribution shift in generative-prior-based inverse problems by measuring reconstruction stability under random measurement variations; demonstrated on MNIST with a proximal network trained only on digit 0, showing higher instability and error for OOD digits and enabling guardrails for undersampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uncertainty quantification for generative priors in inverse problems relies on calibration data, heuristic estimates, or attributes uncertainty to model capacity or measurement limits. There is a need for a calibration-free, instance-level method that detects distribution shift without knowing the training distribution.

Method: Compute reconstruction stability under random measurement perturbations. Images are reconstructed with a learned proximal network trained on a single class (digit 0) and evaluated across all digits. The instability of reconstructions serves as an OOD indicator, requiring no retraining and applicable to any computational imaging inverse problem.

Result: Reconstructions of out-of-distribution digits exhibit higher variability (instability) and higher reconstruction error compared to in-distribution digits, validating the proposed OOD indicator.

Conclusion: The instability-based OOD indicator offers calibration-free, instance-level detection of distribution shift, enabling a deployment strategy that uses generative priors with lightweight guardrails: aggressive undersampling for in-distribution cases and automatic warning when priors are applied out of distribution.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

*Zeteng Lin,Xingxing Li,Wen You,Xiaoyang Li,Zehan Lu,Yujun Cai,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces IUT-Plug with an Image Understanding Tree to enforce structured reasoning in interleaved VLMs, reducing context drift in logic, object identity, and style, and improving QA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle to preserve logical consistency, object identity, and style when generating text from images, limiting generalization in complex multimodal tasks.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) dynamic IUT-Plug extraction parses scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures (IUT); (2) a coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism enforces cross-modal consistency. A dynamic benchmark with 3,000 real human-generated QA pairs evaluates context drift in interleaved VLMs.

Result: Empirical results show higher accuracy on standard benchmarks and reduced context drift across logic, identity, and style in diverse multimodal QA scenarios.

Conclusion: IUT-Plug provides a viable path to explicit structured reasoning in VLMs, improving generalization and cross-modal consistency; future work could scale the IUT and extend evaluation.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Oana Frunza,Kashif Rasul,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chart-RVR fine-tunes LVLMs with GRPO and verifiable rewards to improve chart reasoning, boosting robustness to OOD data and making chain-of-thought rationales more faithful; 3B-parameter models achieve state-of-the-art on six benchmarks, surpassing comparable-size models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel at chart reasoning but struggle with out-of-distribution data and degrade when CoT rationales are required, hindering explainability. There is a need for training frameworks that yield robust, faithful explanations.

Method: Fine-tune LVLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by three automatically verifiable rewards: (1) correct chart-type classification, (2) faithful reconstruction of the chart table, (3) process conformity. The approach targets 3B-parameter LVLMs to improve both accuracy and rationale fidelity under in-domain and OOD conditions.

Result: Chart-RVR-3B models outperform standard supervised fine-tuning on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, closing the OOD gap and achieving state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks for models of comparable size. Rationale explanations (CoT) are more faithful and interpretable.

Conclusion: Verifiable rewards with GRPO can train reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models, demonstrating that structured incentive design improves robustness and explanation quality in LVLMs.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

*Xiaoyu Ma,Ding Ding,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multimodal Mixup (MM) and Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) to mitigate overfitting and modality imbalance in multimodal video understanding by performing mixup at the aggregated feature level and dynamically balancing modality contributions; shows improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models tend to overfit strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress weaker ones. There is a need to account for modality imbalance during training to achieve robust multimodal fusion.

Method: 1) Multimodal Mixup (MM) applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to create virtual feature-label pairs and improve generalization. 2) Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) extends MM by dynamically adjusting the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective, addressing modality imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on several datasets show improved generalization and multimodal robustness due to the proposed methods.

Conclusion: MM enhances generalization in multimodal video understanding; B-MM further mitigates modality imbalance during training, offering more robust multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys Agentic Multimodal LLMs (Agentic MLLMs), proposing a three‑dimensional framework and providing resources, datasets, and directions to accelerate research, with a public repo for updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the rise of agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, the work clarifies concepts, distinguishes agentic MLLMs from conventional MLLMs, and aims to accelerate research through shared resources and evaluation pipelines.

Method: The authors present a conceptual framework organized along three dimensions: (i) internal intelligence as the system's commander for long-horizon planning via reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) external tool invocation for proactive use of external tools; and (iii) environment interaction enabling action in virtual/physical settings. They compile open-source training frameworks and datasets, review downstream applications, and outline future directions, plus maintain a public repository.

Result: The paper establishes a structured framework for agentic MLLMs, curates open-source resources and datasets, surveys applications, and outlines future research directions, aiming to standardize and accelerate progress in the field.

Conclusion: Agentic MLLMs constitute a rapidly evolving research area with strong prospects toward AGI; ongoing community collaboration and resource sharing (e.g., the public repo) will be crucial to track developments and advance capabilities.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAInpainter improves 3D Gaussian inpainting with perspective-aware content propagation and multi-view consistency verification, outperforming prior methods on SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust multi-view consistency and high texture fidelity in 3D Gaussian inpainting, addressing limitations of current diffusion-based methods.

Method: Iteratively refine inpainting and optimize 3D Gaussian representation using adaptively sampled multiple views from a perspective graph; propagate inpainted images as priors and verify cross-view consistency with neighboring views.

Result: Significant gains in 3D inpainting quality, with PSNR 26.03 dB on SPIn-NeRF and 29.51 dB on NeRFiller; outperforming existing methods; improved global consistency and texture fidelity; generalization demonstrated.

Conclusion: PAInpainter advances practical 3D Gaussian inpainting by combining perspective-aware propagation and cross-view verification, enabling better VR/multimedia inpainting results and broader applicability.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and
generalization capability.

### [141] [ContextGen: Contextual Layout Anchoring for Identity-Consistent Multi-Instance Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11000)
*Ruihang Xu,Dewei Zhou,Fan Ma,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextGen, a Diffusion Transformer for multi-instance image generation guided by layout and references; introduces CLA and ICA; releases IMIG-100K; reports state-of-the-art results in control precision, identity fidelity, and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-instance image generation with diffusion models struggles to precisely position and preserve identities of multiple subjects. There is a lack of robust layout anchoring mechanisms and identity-consistent attention, and a lack of large, annotated datasets for this task.

Method: ContextGen introduces two main components: (1) Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) that injects the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor objects at desired positions, and (2) Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) that uses contextual reference images to maintain identity fidelity across multiple instances. It also introduces IMIG-100K, a large dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations for training and evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments show ContextGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: ContextGen advances multi-instance diffusion-based generation by providing precise layout control and reliable identity preservation, supported by a new, richly annotated dataset (IMIG-100K).

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

### [142] [Frequency Domain Unlocks New Perspectives for Abdominal Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11005)
*Kai Han,Siqi Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Jun Chen,Chongwen Lyu,Yuqing Song,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework improves tumor/normal tissue segmentation in low-contrast medical images by (1) emphasizing foreground separation, (2) using wavelet-based high-frequency features for boundary/detail recognition, and (3) enforcing edge continuity; yielding superior, robust performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often fails to differentiate foreground tumors from closely resembling normal tissues in low-contrast backgrounds. Foundation models struggle to focus on foreground areas amid complex context, necessitating mechanisms to amplify foreground, sharpen boundaries, and preserve geometric continuity.

Method: Introduce a foreground-aware module to enhance foreground-background separation. Apply a feature-level frequency enhancement module using wavelet transforms to extract discriminative high-frequency features for boundary delineation. Include an edge constraint module to enforce geometric continuity of segmentation boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets show superior performance across metrics, with robust results in complex conditions and improved fine-structure recognition, particularly improving performance on low-contrast images.

Conclusion: FASS effectively boosts segmentation accuracy for challenging low-contrast medical images and is likely beneficial for broader, more complex imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

### [143] [COCO-Tree: Compositional Hierarchical Concept Trees for Enhanced Reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11012)
*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Tree adds neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to augment VLM outputs and enable beam-search–like, interpretable reasoning to improve compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional reasoning remains a weakness in vision-language models. Existing tricks (prompt design, chain-of-thought) or heavy LLM augmentation either lack interpretability or are resource-intensive. There is a need for an efficient, interpretable method to enhance linguistic reasoning in VLMs.

Method: Introduce COCO-Tree: neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs that augment VLM outputs. Employ a beam-search–inspired reasoning process over the trees to derive a rationale and improve compositionality. Evaluate across multiple VLMs and benchmarks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four compositionality benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, SugarCrepe) across seven open-source VLMs shows COCO-Tree yields 5–10% improvements in compositional generalization over baselines.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree provides a scalable, interpretable neurosymbolic augmentation that enhances linguistic reasoning in VLMs and improves compositional generalization without prohibitive resource demands; performance gains are demonstrated across diverse models and datasets.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

### [144] [High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017)
*Runyang Feng,Hyung Jin Chang,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Boeun Kim,Yi Chang,Yixing Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VHPE framework that combines global 6D spatiotemporal Mamba with a windowed local refinement Mamba to jointly model global dynamics and local high-frequency keypoint motion, achieving linear-complexity scaling and state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VHPE models typically rely on a single modeling structure (convolution or attention) which biases toward either global or local dynamics and suffer from quadratic complexity when modeling global dependencies. Extending Mamba (a linear-complexity state-space model) to 2D spatiotemporal domains enables scalable, long-range dependencies and a principled separation of global vs. local representations.

Method: 1) Global Spatiotemporal Mamba: 6D selective space-time scan with spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. 2) Local Refinement Mamba: windowed space-time scan-based module to enhance high-frequency local keypoint motion details. The two modules are designed to complement each other in an end-to-end VHPE framework.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmark VHPE datasets shows the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while offering better computational trade-offs, particularly in capturing both global dynamics and local motion details at high resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed global+local Mamba framework effectively balances global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal modeling in video-based human pose estimation with scalable linear complexity, delivering superior accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An open-source LVLM, GeoVLMath, learns auxiliary-line reasoning in solid geometry by generating textual auxiliary-line constructions and aligning them with diagrams via a cross-modal RL reward, fueled by the AuxSolidMath dataset; it achieves strong performance at 3B/7B scales on auxiliary-line benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auxiliary lines are central to solving geometric problems but are hard for large vision-language models to handle. Editing diagrams is impractical; textual constructions can leverage LVLM strengths, but require alignment between text and spatial structure.

Method: Introduce a cross-modal reward that measures how well the generated auxiliary-line description matches the ground-truth diagram. Train GeoVLMath with a GRPO-based RL stage to optimize diagram-text alignment. Build a scalable data pipeline and AuxSolidMath (3,018 problems) with diagrams and aligned textual fields.

Result: GeoVLMath at 3B and 7B scales achieves competitive or superior performance on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs.

Conclusion: Text-based auxiliary-line reasoning, guided by a cross-modal RL signal, effectively enhances geometry problem solving. The open-source GeoVLMath and AuxSolidMath dataset provide a reproducible foundation for future research in diagram-text alignment and geometry reasoning.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

*Hongxiang Li,Yaowei Li,Bin Lin,Yuwei Niu,Yuhang Yang,Xiaoshuang Huang,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Yao Hu,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIR-Bench is a reasoning-centric, multimodal benchmark for unified models, with three evaluation pillars—understanding-generation consistency (UGC), reasoning-based text-to-image generation (T2I), and multi-step editing—showing a persistent gap between understanding and generation but enabling fine-grained, interpretable evaluation with public data/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a rigorous benchmark that focuses on reasoning-centric alignment between understanding and generation in multimodal models and their generalization to complex visual tasks, beyond relying on LLM judges.

Method: Introduce three task-specific evaluation pipelines: GIR-Bench-UGC (consistency between understanding and generation), GIR-Bench-T2I (reasoning-centric, constraint-driven text-to-image generation), and GIR-Bench-Edit (multi-step editing). Each subset uses tailored evaluation protocols to enable fine-grained, bias-mitigated assessment; ablations are performed across unified models and generation-only systems; data and code are released at the project site.

Result: Experiments show unified models are stronger at reasoning-driven visual tasks but still exhibit a gap between understanding and generation; the benchmark reveals persistent misalignment between the two capabilities.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench provides a rigorous, interpretable framework to evaluate alignment and generalization of understanding and generation in unified multimodal models, facilitating targeted improvements, with resources publicly available.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Vlaser, a Vision-Language-Action Model that fuses high-level embodied reasoning with low-level control, trained on the Vlaser-6M dataset; claims state-of-the-art performance on embodied reasoning benchmarks and strong results on WidowX and Google Robot, with analysis of VLM initialization effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between upstream Vision-Language Model (VLM) based reasoning and downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy learning for embodied agents; addresses domain shift between internet-scale pretraining and embodied-specific policy data.

Method: Proposes Vlaser, a foundational VLM designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents, built on the Vlaser-6M dataset; evaluates on embodied reasoning benchmarks (spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, task planning); systematically examines how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning to mitigate domain shift.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across embodied reasoning benchmarks; sets new SOTA on WidowX; shows competitive performance on Google Robot.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that integrating embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning is effective; provides insights into the role of VLM initialization in reducing domain gap, and establishes Vlaser as a strong foundation for embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

*Yanning Hou,Ke Xu,Junfa Li,Yanran Ruan,Jianfeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage framework for zero-shot anomaly segmentation leveraging CLIP for localization and SAM for segmentation, with Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation and Cascaded Prompts for SAM; achieves state-of-the-art on Visa dataset, notably +10.3% F1-max and +7.7% AP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong generalization but guiding them for specific tasks like anomaly segmentation is difficult; need targeted prompts to focus on anomalous areas and refine boundaries.

Method: Stage 1 PPG: co-uses CLIP and SAM to create positive/negative prompts guiding SAM to segment anomalous regions rather than whole objects. Stage 2 CPS: cascaded hybrid prompts + lightweight decoder to refine segmentation, reducing rough edges and noise.

Result: State-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation across multiple datasets; notably on Visa dataset, F1-max improved by 10.3 percentage points and AP by 7.7 percentage points over prior SOTA.

Conclusion: PPG and CPS effectively combine CLIP and SAM for precise zero-shot anomaly segmentation, demonstrating a strong, scalable approach for industrial anomaly detection with foundation models.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

*Nivea Roy,Son Tran,Atul Sajjanhar,K. Devaraja,Prakashini Koteshwara,Yong Xiang,Divya Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaryngealCT provides a standardized, open benchmark of 1,029 laryngeal CT scans with uniform 1 mm VOIs, enabling reproducible deep learning research; 3D CNNs and ResNet variants outperform baselines, with GradCAM-based explanations, offering pretrained models and tools for clinical AI in laryngeal oncology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of standardized, reproducible datasets for DL in laryngeal cancer imaging and provide a benchmark for model development, evaluation, and explainability.

Method: Aggregate 1,029 CT scans from TCIA into LaryngealCT; extract uniform 1 mm isotropic VOIs around the larynx using a weakly supervised parameter search validated by clinicians; benchmark 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18/50/101, DenseNet121) on two tasks: (i) early (Tis/T1/T2) vs advanced (T3/T4) and (ii) T4 vs non-T4; evaluate with AUC and F1-macro; assess explainability with 3D GradCAMs overlaid on thyroid cartilage.

Result: 3D CNN (AUC 0.881, F1-macro 0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC 0.892, F1-macro 0.646) outperformed other models for the two tasks; GradCAM-based explanations showed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 and focal activations in T4; dataset and pretrained models, with integrated explainability tools, are open under LaryngealCT.

Conclusion: LaryngealCT provides a reproducible foundation for AI-driven laryngeal oncology research, enabling open data, pretrained models, and explainability to support clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

### [150] [Zero-shot Face Editing via ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11050)
*Yang Hou,Minggu Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot face-editing method that decouples identity (ID) and attributes in the diffusion inversion process, enabling independent control over ID and facial attributes with text prompts, while preserving identity and structure and achieving DDIM-speed performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided diffusion editing often loses identity and facial structure in real-face editing; a robust method is needed to preserve ID and geometry while allowing flexible attribute edits.

Method: Decompose face representations into separate identity and attribute features and use them as joint conditions to guide both the inversion and reverse diffusion steps, enabling independent ID and attribute manipulation via text prompts without region-specific inputs.

Result: Demonstrates strong identity preservation and structural consistency during edits, supports a wide range of multi-attribute edits using only text prompts, and operates at DDIM inversion speed; validated through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion enables reliable zero-shot face editing with diffusion models by independently controlling identity and attributes, offering practical speed and broad applicability without region-based inputs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025 introduces Complex VOS (MOSEv2) with harder long-term scenarios, retains classic VOS/RVOS tracks, adopts J&dot{F} as the primary MOSEv2 metric, and highlights trends like LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation toward language-aware video segmentation in the wild.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push robust, long-term video object segmentation in realistic, diverse conditions beyond curated benchmarks, by increasing task difficulty and evaluating cross-scale and appearance-disappearance dynamics.

Method: Introduce MOSEv2 as a new, more challenging track featuring denser small objects, frequent disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, and adverse weather/lighting; continue with Classic VOS and RVOS tracks using J, F, and J&F metrics, while adopting J&dot{F} as the primary ranking metric for MOSEv2; summarize datasets/protocols; report top-performing solutions; identify trends such as integration of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation.

Result: The abstract reports on datasets and protocols, highlights top-performing solutions for the tracks, and distills emergent trends, notably the rising role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation in advancing resilient, language-aware video segmentation.

Conclusion: MOSEv2 is positioned to push long-term consistency, generalization, and language-aware capabilities in challenging real-world video segmentation, guiding future research toward resilient, cross-scale, and language-integrated VOS.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

TL;DR: ROFI is a deep-learning privacy-protection framework for ophthalmology that anonymizes patient face images while preserving ocular disease signals, enabling secure AI diagnosis with reversible anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect patient privacy in face-containing ophthalmology images without sacrificing diagnostic utility, enabling audits and long-term care.

Method: Weakly supervised learning and neural identity translation to anonymize facial features while preserving disease-related features; evaluated across three cohorts and eleven eye diseases; measured diagnostic accuracy, kappa, anonymization rate, and reversibility.

Result: Anonymized over 95% of images; disease detection achieves 100% sensitivity and kappa > 0.90 across eleven diseases; AI system diagnoses preserved with kappa > 0.80; secure reversal with >98% similarity; supports audits.

Conclusion: ROFI effectively protects patient privacy in digital ophthalmology while maintaining high diagnostic performance and enabling reversible anonymization for audits and long-term care.

Abstract: Patient face images provide a convenient mean for evaluating eye diseases,
while also raising privacy concerns. Here, we introduce ROFI, a deep
learning-based privacy protection framework for ophthalmology. Using weakly
supervised learning and neural identity translation, ROFI anonymizes facial
features while retaining disease features (over 98\% accuracy, $\kappa >
0.90$). It achieves 100\% diagnostic sensitivity and high agreement ($\kappa >
0.90$) across eleven eye diseases in three cohorts, anonymizing over 95\% of
images. ROFI works with AI systems, maintaining original diagnoses ($\kappa >
0.80$), and supports secure image reversal (over 98\% similarity), enabling
audits and long-term care. These results show ROFI's effectiveness of
protecting patient privacy in the digital medicine era.

### [153] [Source-Free Object Detection with Detection Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11090)
*Huizai Yao,Sicheng Zhao,Shuo Lu,Hui Chen,Yangyang Li,Guoping Liu,Tengfei Xing,Chenggang Yan,Jianhua Tao,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DETR-tailored, source-free object detection framework (FRANCK) uses objectness-based sample reweighting, memory-based multi-level contrastive learning, uncertainty-aware query feature distillation, and a dynamic teacher update to adapt a source-pretrained DETR to a new domain, achieving state-of-the-art performance among DETR-based SFOD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address SFOD specifically for DETR architectures, overcoming limitations of prior SFOD work that mostly targets Faster R-CNN or generic pipelines, and to improve cross-domain robustness for DETR-based detectors.

Method: FRANCK comprises four components: (1) OSSR to reweight multi-scale encoder features using objectness scores during training; (2) CMMB to build a memory bank that stores multi-level features for class-wise contrastive learning; (3) UQFD to weight feature distillation by prediction uncertainty and fuse query features; (4) DTUI to dynamically update the teacher model interval for higher-quality pseudo-labels. The integration yields a source-free adaptation pipeline for DETR-based detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance for DETR-based SFOD methods, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to target domains.

Conclusion: FRANCK provides an effective DETR-focused SFOD solution, validating that query-centric feature reweighting, memory-based contrastive learning, and uncertainty-aware distillation, combined with dynamic teacher updates, enhance cross-domain detection without access to source data.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

### [154] [Text-Enhanced Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11091)
*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A panoptic symbol spotting framework for CAD drawings that jointly models geometric and textual primitives using a CNN backbone followed by a Transformer with type-aware attention, achieving superior performance and robustness on CAD symbol spotting with annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD drawings contain rich textual annotations; existing methods focus on geometric primitives and ignore relations, limiting holistic understanding and downstream tasks like CAD automation.

Method: Unified representation of geometric and textual primitives; initial features from pretrained CNN; Transformer backbone; type-aware attention to capture spatial dependencies across primitive types; multi-modal fusion of text and geometry.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations; shows robustness on complex CAD drawings using real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating textual annotations with geometric primitives via a type-aware Transformer improves panoptic symbol spotting in CAD, enabling better downstream CAD tasks and suggesting future multi-modal CAD analysis directions.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeerDrive presents an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that jointly predicts future scene evolution and vehicle trajectories in a closed loop, using predicted BEV features to inform planning and iterative optimization between scene modeling and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-shot end-to-end methods over-rely on current scene context and neglect how dynamic scene evolution and bidirectional influence between the vehicle and environment affect planning, leading to less adaptive behavior in complex scenarios.

Method: The approach first predicts future bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations to forecast scene dynamics; then uses this foresight to generate trajectories that are aware of future context. It includes (1) future-aware planning by injecting predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning that collaboratively refine future scene prediction and trajectory generation.

Result: Experiments on NAVSIM and nuScenes show SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Modeling future scene evolution and the bidirectional influence between the vehicle and its environment, in a closed-loop framework, improves trajectory planning and yields more adaptive behavior in complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [156] [CoDefend: Cross-Modal Collaborative Defense via Diffusion Purification and Prompt Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11096)
*Fengling Zhu,Boshi Liu,Jingyu Hua,Sheng Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A supervised diffusion-based denoising defense for the visual modality of multimodal LLMs that surpasses unsupervised purification and enhances robustness to adversarial attacks, with prompt optimization as a complementary defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in visual and/or textual inputs. The visual channel often acts as the primary attack surface, which can degrade multimodal tasks like image captioning and VQA. Traditional defenses (adversarial training, input purification) have high costs or poor generalization. A robust, generalizable defense for the visual modality is needed to secure real-world deployment.

Method: A supervised diffusion-based denoising framework trained with paired adversarial-clean image datasets. The diffusion model is fine-tuned with directional, task-specific guidance. Additionally, prompt optimization is introduced as a complementary defense to bolster resilience against unseen attack strategies.

Result: Experiments on image captioning and VQA show substantial robustness gains and higher-quality reconstructions compared to prior unsupervised methods (e.g., DiffPure). The approach exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks, indicating effective generalization in multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: Supervised diffusion-based denoising, enhanced by prompt optimization, provides an effective defense for the visual modality in multimodal LLMs, enabling more reliable and secure deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

### [157] [Compositional Zero-Shot Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11106)
*Ans Munir,Faisal Z. Qureshi,Mohsen Ali,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) that introduces a disentanglement-based taxonomy (no disentanglement, textual, visual, cross-modal), analyzes methods across closed-world and open-world settings, highlights strengths/weaknesses, and outlines open challenges and future directions, with a GitHub resource for papers and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CZSL is important for recognizing unseen attribute–object combinations, addressing the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. Visual primitives are highly contextual (e.g., small vs. old, wet vs. dry), making robust compositional modeling essential. A systematic survey fills a gap by organizing methods, comparing approaches, and guiding future research.

Method: Systematic literature review of CZSL methods and related works. Proposes a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement with four families: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement. Provides a comparative analysis of core advantages/limitations, discusses performance in closed-world and open-world CZSL, and identifies significant open challenges and future research directions. Compiles studied papers and official code, available at a GitHub repository.

Result: A structured synthesis of the CZSL landscape: (1) a clear taxonomy based on disentanglement, (2) a comparative framework for evaluating methods across problem settings, (3) a synthesis of strengths, limitations, and practical considerations, and (4) a roadmap of open challenges and future directions, along with a curated resource hub (GitHub).

Conclusion: This survey establishes a foundational resource for CZSL, enabling researchers to navigate existing approaches, understand where contextuality and compositionality are best addressed, and identify fruitful directions for advancing robust CZSL in both closed-world and open-world contexts.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

*Jiahui Lei,Kyle Genova,George Kopanas,Noah Snavely,Leonidas Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a pixel-aligned 3D motion representation (MoMap) learned from real videos to predict future 3D scene motion from a single image, using diffusion on a large MoMap dataset and a pipeline that generates MoMaps, warps images, and renders warped point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain semantically meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world data for single-image future motion prediction, addressing limitations of existing 3D motion representations and data scarcity.

Method: Define MoMap as a pixel-aligned representation of 3D motion; generate MoMaps from existing generative image models; assemble a large MoMap dataset from 50,000 real videos; train a diffusion model on MoMaps to learn motion distributions; propose a 2D video synthesis pipeline: generate MoMap, warp a source image accordingly, and complete the warped point-based renderings.

Result: The approach yields plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion, demonstrating that diffusion on MoMaps can predict realistic 3D motion trajectories.

Conclusion: MoMap enables efficient learning of semantically meaningful 3D motion priors from real videos and provides a practical pipeline for 2D video synthesis by leveraging MoMaps to guide 3D motion and subsequent image warping and rendering.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro is a framework that disentangles static anatomy and dynamic pathology in longitudinal chest X-rays (CXRs) and aligns them with asynchronous EHR data at multiple timescales to model disease progression and enhance ICU prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal multimodal data (EHR + CXRs) can inform disease trajectories but are underutilized due to two issues: redundancy where static anatomy drowns out dynamic pathology, and temporal misalignment between sparse imaging and continuous EHR signals.

Method: Region-aware disentanglement to separate static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) CXR features; hierarchical, multi-timescale alignment that synchronizes these CXR features with EHR data using local (pairwise interval-level) and global (full-sequence) strategies to capture coherent progression pathways.

Result: On the MIMIC dataset, DiPro effectively extracts temporal clinical dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance for disease progression identification and general ICU prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DiPro demonstrates that region-aware disentanglement combined with multi-timescale alignment enables robust modeling of longitudinal clinical progression from multimodal data, with strong empirical gains on ICU prognosis and progression tasks.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

*Hao Tang,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework (SynTrans) that transfers diverse knowledge from large multimodal models to a basic few-shot learner, using CLIP as teacher, bridging visual and semantic spaces, to achieve state-of-the-art results on four FSL datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning is hampered by data scarcity and the bias/noise introduced when relying on semantic knowledge from small models; large multimodal models offer richer, complementary knowledge that should be leveraged effectively.

Method: 1) Distill semantic-aligned visual knowledge from CLIP to a weak student via an unsupervised proxy task. 2) A training-free synergistic knowledge mining module enables collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality semantic knowledge. 3) A visual-semantic bridging module enables bi-directional transfer between visual and semantic spaces, turning explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into category-specific classifier weights. 4) A visual weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor adaptively construct multimodal FSL classifiers.

Result: Experimental results on four FSL datasets show SynTrans significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, even with a simple few-shot vision encoder.

Conclusion: SynTrans effectively leverages large multimodal knowledge to empower off-the-shelf FSL learners, demonstrating robust cross-modal knowledge transfer and adaptive classifier construction for few-shot settings.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scaling up data and model size does not fix numerosity in diffusion-based image generation; a count-aware layout injected into the noise prior dramatically improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether diffusion models can inherently generate the specified number of objects with larger models/datasets and to identify the underlying cause and a remedy.

Method: Create two synthetic benchmarks GrayCount250 and NaturalCount6; evaluate counting accuracy under scaling; analyze noise priors; propose injecting count-aware layout into the noise prior; measure improvements.

Result: Scaling alone fails to improve numerosity. Noise priors bias counts. With count-aware layout injection, accuracy improves from 20.0% to 85.3% on GrayCount250 and from 74.8% to 86.3% on NaturalCount6.

Conclusion: Numerosity control in diffusion models requires targeted conditioning beyond scale; the proposed noise-prior layout injection generalizes across settings and benchmarks.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

### [162] [video-SALMONN S: Streaming Audio-Visual LLMs Beyond Length Limits via Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11129)
*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An 8B-parameter streaming audio-visual LLM (video-SALMONN S) processes multi-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p under fixed memory using a test-time-training memory module and a prompt-dependent memory reader, achieving strong long-context video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for continuous, high-frame-rate, long-context video understanding for future AI agents. Existing offline fixed-frame methods and streaming methods either require adaptable frame rates or discard information to fit memory, leading to loss of long-range information.

Method: Introduce a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations by replacing token merging to capture long-range dependencies, and a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves content from a fixed-size memory. The TTT is optimized with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation. Evaluate a model with ~8B parameters on long-video benchmarks, achieving 1 FPS processing with 3-hour videos and 10k frames / 1M tokens under a fixed memory budget.

Result: Video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos across Video-MME, LVBench, and VideoEvalPro benchmarks, achieving 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that streaming AV LLMs with a memory-refining TTT module and a selective memory reader can achieve competitive long-duration video understanding under fixed memory. This advances scalable long-context video processing and supports practical deployment of AI agents that must reason over multi-hour streams.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

### [163] [Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool for the Detection of Sperm DNA Fragmentation Using the TUNEL In Situ Hybridization Assay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11142)
*Byron Alexander Jacobs,Aqeel Morris,Ifthakaar Shaik,Frando Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based method detects sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) from phase-contrast images using TUNEL as the gold standard. It uses a morphology-assisted ensemble model combining image processing with a GC-ViT transformer, outperforms morphology-only and pure transformer baselines, with 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity, enabling non-destructive real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDF is a key indicator of male fertility that conventional semen analysis misses. There is a need for non-destructive, rapid in-situ assessment of DNA fragmentation in sperm to improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic decision-making.

Method: Developed a morphology-assisted ensemble AI model that fuses phase-contrast image processing with a transformer-based GC-ViT architecture to predict DNA fragmentation, using TUNEL assay as the gold standard. Benchmarked against a pure transformer 'vision' model and a 'morphology-only' model.

Result: The ensemble model achieved 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity in predicting SDF from phase-contrast images, showing promise as a non-destructive tool for real-time sperm selection and clinical decision support.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant advancement in reproductive medicine by enabling non-destructive, real-time assessment of DNA integrity in sperm, with potential clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### [164] [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171)
*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) to fuse PolSAR covariance matrices (HPD manifold) and multi-features (Grassmann manifold) via kernel metric learning and Dempster-Shafer evidential fusion, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in PolSAR classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PolSAR analysis benefits from multiple, complementary views (covariance matrices and hand-crafted features) that live on different geometric manifolds. Traditional fusion methods ignore manifold geometry and view-specific uncertainty, potentially reducing reliability.

Method: Represent covariance on the HPD manifold and features on the Grassmann manifold; use two kernel metric learning networks to learn their representations; apply a trusted multiview evidential fusion to estimate belief mass and view uncertainty; fuse evidence with Dempster-Shafer theory to produce final decisions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets show that MMEFnet consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: MMEFnet provides a unified architecture that integrates manifold learning with evidential fusion, yielding more reliable and interpretable PolSAR classification by explicitly handling view-specific uncertainty and geometry.

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

### [165] [CoPRS: Learning Positional Prior from Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11173)
*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS introduces a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) approach that generates a differentiable heatmap as a positional prior to connect reasoning with segmentation, yielding interpretable masks and strong performance on RefCOCO and ReasonSeg datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning-segmentation methods either directly connect language features to a mask decoder or rely on text-position representations, which hurts interpretability and semantic detail. A transparent, dense, learnable prior could improve both interpretability and segmentation accuracy.

Method: Propose CoPRS, where a learnable concentration token aggregates image features and reasoning text to produce a dense, differentiable heatmap (positional prior) via Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This heatmap is decoded by a lightweight decoder to produce precise masks. Training emphasizes the link between reasoning output (heatmap) and downstream segmentation, with evaluations on RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg.

Result: CoPRS matches or surpasses the best reported metrics on standard splits across RefCOCO and ReasonSeg, with performance at or above prior state-of-the-art on both validation and test sets. Experiments show heatmap quality strongly influences mask quality, supporting a robust association between reasoning and segmentation and improving interpretability and concentration.

Conclusion: The findings validate the paradigm of bridging reasoning and segmentation via a differentiable heatmap as a positional prior. Reasoning-driven concentration enhances mask precision and interpretability, with code and checkpoints released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

### [166] [Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11175)
*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO suppresses style interference in cross-modal embedding by weighting feature columns by semantic probability and iteratively refining prototypes with performance feedback, yielding robust improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal alignment hinges on semantic consistency, but non-semantic style information introduces bias and information loss. Existing methods rely on feature-column separation and fail to capture the complex semantic–style coupling, necessitating a framework that suppresses style during embedding interaction.

Method: For each feature column, quantify the probability that it encodes semantic information and treat this as a weight during embedding interaction. Propose a prototype iterative construction method with a performance-feedback-based weighting function that increases weight for prototypes yielding higher performance gains, with theoretical justification.

Result: Empirical evaluations on diverse benchmarks and backbones show that PICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%–14.1%.

Conclusion: PICO effectively suppresses style interference in cross-modal embedding interactions and generalizes across models and datasets, offering a principled, performance-validated approach to semantic-focused alignment.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

### [167] [G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176)
*Yesung Cho,Sungmin Lee,Geongyu Lee,Minkyung Lee,Jongbae Park,Dongmyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework (G2L) transfers giga-scale foundation model capabilities to a 15%-size large-scale model using only 1,000 target-cancer slides, achieving competitive or superior performance on cancer-specific tasks with improved robustness and reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational and data demands of giga-scale foundation models in pathology by enabling giga-scale-level performance with far fewer parameters and far less data, making practical deployment feasible for cancer-specific tasks.

Method: Knowledge distillation from a giga-scale teacher model to a large-scale student model. The student uses only ~1,000 slides from a target cancer type and ends up with ~15% of the teacher's parameters. The approach likely includes training regimes that transfer representations and capabilities, evaluated across multiple cancer-specific benchmarks and robustness across institutions.

Result: The distilled 15%-size model outperforms state-of-the-art large-scale models on several benchmarks, and in some cases matches or surpasses the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models. It also shows a higher robustness index, indicating better resilience to image variations from multiple institutions.

Conclusion: A data- and parameter-efficient distillation approach can achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific tasks without the prohibitive computational costs associated with training and deploying giga-scale models.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

### [168] [BLEnD-Vis: Benchmarking Multimodal Cultural Understanding in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11178)
*Bryan Chen Zhengyu Tan,Zheng Weihua,Zhengyuan Liu,Nancy F. Chen,Hwaran Lee,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis is a multimodal, multicultural benchmark to test robustness of cultural knowledge in vision-language models across linguistic rephrasings and visual inputs; it reveals fragility and limited cross-modal grounding, especially for lower-resource regions, and provides a testbed for improving culturally competent VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs operate globally, they must understand culturally situated knowledge; current evaluations focus on static recall or isolated grounding and do not test robustness/transferability across language and modalities.

Method: Extend BLEnD with 313 templates across 16 regions; produce three MCQ formats: (i) text-only region-to-entity, (ii) inverted text-only entity-to-region, (iii) VQA-style with generated images; 4,916 images and 21k MCQs; human-annotated validation.

Result: Models show large drops with linguistic rephrasings; visual cues help but cross-modal consistency is weak; lower-resource regions particularly affected.

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis provides a crucial testbed to systematically analyze cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T5-based SSL translation benefits significantly from pre-training on ASL data (YouTubeASL), achieving ~3x BLEU-4 gains; demonstrates cross-linguistic transfer and value of large-scale ASL data for SSL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL translation is limited by small datasets and distinctive sign-language features (e.g., face coverings). This work explores cross-linguistic transfer by pre-training T5 models on a large ASL corpus (YouTubeASL) and evaluating on a novel SSL dataset with three testing protocols.

Method: Train T5 models on the SSL dataset; compare models pre-trained on YouTubeASL versus models trained directly on SSL; evaluate across three testing protocols; analyze impact of SSL-specific challenges like face coverings; release code.

Result: Pre-training on YouTubeASL yields substantial BLEU-4 gains (roughly 3x) over SSL-only models, indicating strong cross-linguistic transferability and effectiveness of leveraging large-scale ASL data for SSL translation.

Conclusion: Cross-linguistic pre-training on large ASL data benefits SSL translation; the SSL dataset with challenging protocols provides robust evaluation; supports development of more effective sign language translation systems; code released.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [170] [FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11190)
*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexAC is a training-free framework that enables flexible, task-dependent control of associative reasoning in multimodal LLMs by using hallucination-guided intermediate representations to construct steering vectors and adaptively calibrate their strength, including task-specific vectors from few-shot samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity in multimodal LLMs. Existing models lack a flexible mechanism to modulate associative reasoning strength across factual and creative tasks, hindering adaptability.

Method: 1) Analyze internal associative dynamics, finding middle layers shape associative tendencies. 2) Use hallucination signals to derive steering vectors. 3) Construct high-association steering vectors from selected instances and adaptively calibrate their strengths. 4) Introduce task-specific associative vectors from few target-domain samples via a forward pass to enable diverse directions. 5) Deliver a lightweight, training-free framework (FlexAC) for controllable associative reasoning.

Result: FlexAC yields up to 5.8x improvements in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, outperforming baselines. Code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: FlexAC offers an effective, lightweight approach to modulating associative reasoning in MLLMs, enabling flexible adaptation to creative and factual tasks without additional training, and suggesting avenues for further multi-dimensional steering in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

### [171] [Class Prototypes based Contrastive Learning for Classifying Multi-Label and Fine-Grained Educational Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11204)
*Rohit Gupta,Anirban Roy,Claire Christensen,Sujeong Kim,Sarah Gerard,Madeline Cincebeaux,Ajay Divakaran,Todd Grindal,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel prototype-based supervised contrastive learning framework for fine-grained, multi-label educational content detection in online videos, leveraging a multimodal transformer and a new dataset (APPROVE) that achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of children's online media necessitates automated filtering of educational content aligned with standards; existing methods struggle with fine-grained, multi-label, and multimodal settings.

Method: Proposes class prototypes for each educational content class; uses a supervised contrastive loss to pull samples toward their class prototypes and push away others; handles multi-label by jointly considering prototypes; employs a multimodal transformer to fuse visual and audio cues for video embedding; introduces APPROVE dataset with expert labels (193 hours, 19 classes).

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and benchmarks like Youtube-8M and COIN; demonstrates effectiveness of prototype-based contrastive learning in a multimodal, fine-grained setting.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective, scalable solution for fine-grained, multi-label educational content detection in videos and contributes a high-quality dataset; could enable better content filtering for early childhood education.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

### [172] [Investigating Identity Signals in Conversational Facial Dynamics via Disentangled Expression Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11223)
*Masoumeh Chapariniya,Pierre Vuillecard,Jean-Marc Odobez,Volker Dellwo,Teodora Vukovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faces can be identified from dynamics alone, using FLAME to disentangle shape from expression; a Conformer with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way identification on the CANDOR dataset, far above chance; a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) quantifies reliability of shape-expression separation and negatively correlates with recognition performance; findings suggest robust person-specific dynamic facial signatures with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether dynamic facial expressions carry enough person-specific identity information independent of static facial appearance, addressing fundamental questions in social perception and potential clinical applications; to develop a metric (DNR) for assessing reliability of dynamic-identity extraction.

Method: Disentangle facial shape from expression dynamics using the FLAME 3D morphable model; extract frame-by-frame parameters retaining expression and jaw coefficients; train a Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning on conversational videos from the CANDOR dataset (1,429 speakers); evaluate on 1,429-way identification; introduce drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) to quantify cross-session shape-change versus within-session variability and correlate with recognition performance.

Result: Achieved 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way identification (458x above chance); DNR negatively correlates with recognition performance, indicating more reliable shape-expression separation yields better dynamic identification.

Conclusion: Dynamic facial expression dynamics carry person-specific identity information when disentangled from static appearance; this has implications for theories of social perception and potential clinical assessments, but raises privacy and generalization concerns; stable shape estimation is important for reliable dynamic-ID, and the DNR metric provides a diagnostic tool for reliability.

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Result: On an independent test set, LightPneumoNet achieved overall accuracy 0.942, precision 0.92, F1-score 0.96, and a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, indicating near-perfect true positive detection with low false negatives.

Conclusion: The model offers a highly efficient pneumonia diagnostic tool suitable for underserved clinics, providing high recall and acceptable precision while maintaining a small memory footprint, potentially serving as a reliable second-opinion aid.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

*Weixuan Li,Quanjun Li,Guang Yu,Song Yang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DTEA, a skip-connection framework with STR and EPG for medical image segmentation, leveraging a dynamic hypergraph to fuse multi-scale features and entropy-based channel gating to refine spatial attention; achieves state-of-the-art results and better generalization on three datasets; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skip connections in medical image segmentation often suffer from limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, leading to weaker generalization in complex clinical scenarios.

Method: STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic hypergraph to capture cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing structural and semantic representation. EPG evaluates channel stability after perturbation and gates out high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions, thereby improving spatial attention. These modules are integrated into a new skip-connection framework (DTEA).

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across diverse clinical settings.

Conclusion: The DTEA framework with STR and EPG improves structural and semantic representation and spatial attention, yielding improved generalization in medical image segmentation; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

### [176] [A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11260)
*Yuxuan Chen,Ruotong Yang,Zhengyang Zhang,Mehreen Ahmed,Yanming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal automated SEM scale-bar detection framework leveraging Auto-DG dataset generation, multi-task detection, hybrid OCR, and an LLM agent to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in scale-bar localization and information extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scale-bar annotation in SEM is time-consuming and error-prone; a robust, generalizable automated pipeline is needed for accurate microscopy measurements and broader reproducibility.

Method: Four-phase framework: (i) Auto-DG synthesizes diverse SEM-like images; (ii) scale-bar object detection; (iii) OCR-based information extraction combining DenseNet and CRNN; (iv) an LLM agent validates and reasons about results and suggests follow-ups.

Result: Object detection: precision 100%, recall 95.8%, mAP 99.2% at IoU=0.5; 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. OCR: 89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 on Auto-DG; outperforms mainstream engines. LLM enhances verification and guidance, improving reliability.

Conclusion: The integrated pipeline with LLM reasoning improves efficiency and accuracy in SEM scale-bar detection, offering a valuable tool for automated microscopic analysis and advancing scientific imaging.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

### [177] [Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11268)
*Jaeik Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We introduce Class Vectors, per-class representation adjustments learned during fine-tuning to enable flexible, efficient classifier editing by steering latent features or updating decision boundaries; enabled by linear, orthogonal properties that support class arithmetic and enable applications like unlearning, adaptation, and defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc editing of image classifiers is difficult: existing methods are either narrowly focused or require extensive retraining, and there is limited exploration of classifier editing in image classification. A flexible mechanism to forget, adapt to distribution shifts, and defend against adversarial issues is needed.

Method: Propose Class Vectors as class-specific representation adjustments captured in the latent space during fine-tuning. Unlike task vectors, Class Vectors disentangle per-class adaptation in latent space; editing can be performed by steering latent features along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update decision boundaries, leveraging their linearity and orthogonality for simple class arithmetic.

Result: Empirically validate that Class Vectors capture each class’s semantic shifts and enable efficient editing across applications, including unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and adversarial trigger optimization.

Conclusion: Class Vectors offer an efficient, flexible framework for high-level concept editing in image classifiers, enabling per-class adjustments with simple arithmetic and broad applicability to robustness and adaptability challenges.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel medical image segmentation model, EEMS, fusing edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale prompt-guided features via a dual-source adaptive fusion, achieving superior performance on ISIC2018 and showing clinical promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation is hampered by ambiguous edges and background noise, necessitating robust boundary delineation and accurate target localization.

Method: Propose EEMS composed of: (1) Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) with multi-frequency feature extraction to sharpen edges; (2) Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU) that fuses high-level semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided mechanism; (3) Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) that merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU for improved fusion and robustness.

Result: Experimental results on datasets including ISIC2018 indicate superior segmentation performance and strong reliability, supporting EEMS as a promising clinical tool.

Conclusion: EEMS demonstrates that integrating edge-focused enhancement with multi-scale semantic–spatial fusion via a gated dual-source fusion yields more accurate and robust medical image segmentations, with demonstrated clinical potential and avenues for broader validation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

### [179] [Human Uncertainty-Aware Data Selection and Automatic Labeling in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11295)
*Jian Lan,Zhicheng Liu,Udo Schlegel,Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaDola: a human uncertainty-aware data selection and labeling framework that improves supervised fine-tuning of large vision-language models by leveraging human uncertainty (HU). Key insights: high-HU samples offer little or harm; naive training on full HU-rich data yields miscalibration; HaDola bootstraps from a small seed (~5%) and iteratively identifies harmful/informative samples, labels them automatically, and trains to achieve better accuracy and calibration with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world datasets exhibit human uncertainty in annotations, where confidence varies across samples. Standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) optimizes for the majority label and ignores HU distributions, potentially wasting labeling effort and causing calibration issues. The paper seeks to understand HU's impact on SFT and to design methods that exploit HU to improve data efficiency and model calibration.

Method: 1) Systematic evaluation of VLMs across varying HU levels. 2) HaDola pipeline with four stages: discriminate (identify harmful versus informative HU samples), self-annotate (automatic labeling of selected data), error trigger (prioritize samples causing ambiguity or errors), and training (fine-tune with bootstrapped data from a small seed set, ~5% of data). The approach reduces reliance on expensive HU annotations while prioritizing informative samples and leveraging automatic labeling and iterative refinement. Datasets include VQAv2 and VizWiz.

Result: HaDola consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines while using less training data. The study finds that high-HU samples contribute little or can degrade performance, and training on full HU-rich data yields under-calibrated models. By explicitly modeling HU and focusing on informative samples, HaDola improves accuracy and calibration, reducing labeling costs and enhancing data efficiency.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling human uncertainty in SFT is beneficial and more data-efficient than indiscriminately increasing dataset size. HaDola demonstrates that HU-aware data selection and automatic labeling can achieve strong VLM performance with significantly less annotated data, and better calibration on benchmarks like VQAv2 and VizWiz.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

### [180] [$Δ\mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296)
*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Delta Energy (ΔEnergy) is a new energy-based OOD score that improves both detection and covariate-shift generalization in vision-language models, backed by EBM optimization and Hessian analysis, achieving gains of 10–25% AUROC over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the dual challenge in vision-language models of handling in-distribution data and open-set OOD data, which includes covariate shifts (e.g., style changes on known classes) and semantic shifts (test-time unseen classes). Existing methods struggle to jointly optimize OOD detection and OOD generalization. Inspired by large energy changes observed when re-aligning vision-language modalities, the work proposes a novel OOD score (ΔEnergy) and an optimization framework (EBM) to improve robustness and detection, with theoretical ties to a domain-consistent Hessian.

Method: Define a novel OOD score, ΔEnergy, by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value during alignment of vision-language representations. Compare ΔEnergy to vanilla energy-based OOD scores. Propose EBM (lower-bound maximization of ΔEnergy) to enhance OOD generalization under covariate shifts, and prove that EBM yields a domain-consistent Hessian. Develop a unified fine-tuning framework that optimizes for both OOD detection and OOD generalization within VLMs.

Result: ΔEnergy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score for open-set detection and generalization, with improvements of about 10% to 25% in AUROC on challenging benchmarks. The EBM approach provides theoretical benefits, including better OOD detection and a domain-consistent Hessian that correlates with OOD generalization. The unified fine-tuning framework demonstrates robust improvements in both OOD detection and generalization.

Conclusion: ΔEnergy offers a reliable, theoretically grounded OOD score that enhances both detection and generalization for vision-language models under covariate and semantic shifts. The EBM-based optimization yields a domain-consistent Hessian, supporting better generalization, and the proposed unified fine-tuning framework delivers practical robustness gains across challenging OOD benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effectiveness comparison of supervised YOLO vs zero-shot Gemini Flash 2.5 for object detection using a Total Cost of Ownership model; the study identifies break-even thresholds where each approach is preferable depending on deployment scale and category stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify trade-offs between annotation costs and zero-shot capabilities; determine when zero-shot methods justify lower accuracy.

Method: Empirical evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images; compare YOLO (supervised) vs Gemini Flash 2.5 (zero-shot) under a Total Cost of Ownership framework; compute accuracy, per-detection cost, and break-even inferences; provide decision frameworks.

Result: YOLO achieves 91.2% on standard categories vs Gemini 68.5%; 22.7 pp gap; annotation cost $10,800 for 100-category systems; break-even at 55 million inferences (~151k images/day for a year). Gemini achieves 52.3% on diverse product categories where YOLO fails (0% for untrained classes); per-detection cost Gemini $0.00050 vs YOLO $0.143 at 100k inferences. Provides deployment-volume–driven guidelines.

Conclusion: Cost-effectiveness depends on deployment context; not purely on accuracy; provides practical framework for architecture selection based on volume, category stability, and budget; the results enable informed trade-offs in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

*Yan Zhou,Mingji Li,Xiantao Zeng,Jie Lin,Yuexia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sketch2Symm is a two-stage sketch-to-3D reconstruction method that uses semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation and symmetry priors to produce geometrically consistent shapes, achieving improved metrics on standard sketch datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction is hindered by the abstract, sparse nature of sketches, which lack semantic and geometric information. There is a need to enrich sketches and enforce geometric regularities to produce coherent 3D shapes.

Method: A two-stage framework (Sketch2Symm): (1) sketch-to-image translation for semantic bridging to enrich sparse sketches, (2) symmetry-constrained 3D shape generation using symmetry priors to exploit regularity in everyday objects.

Result: The method achieves superior performance over existing sketch-based reconstruction methods on mainstream sketch datasets, evaluated via Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score.

Conclusion: Semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design effectively improve sketch-based 3D reconstruction, yielding geometrically consistent shapes.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

### [183] [Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305)
*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ensemble pipeline across preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation reveals substantial sensitivity to speckle filtering and flood-mapping choices, supporting uncertainty-aware approaches in SAR-based flood analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating and validating hydraulic models requires accurate flood extent and water depth from SAR imagery. The study investigates how preprocessing choices (notably speckle filtering) and downstream steps influence results and emphasizes the propagation of methodological uncertainty through the pipeline.

Method: Evaluate multiple preprocessing steps (speckle filters), several flood-mapping methods (supervised and unsupervised), and water-depth estimation approaches. An ensemble is formed from preprocessed images, flood maps, and depth fields. Case studies cover two Garonne River floods (France, 2019 and 2021). Reference data comes from hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations.

Result: The speckle filter choice can shift flood extent by several square kilometers. Flood-mapping method choice significantly affects performance; supervised methods outperform unsupervised ones, though well-tuned unsupervised methods (e.g., local thresholding, change detection) can approach supervised results. Uncertainties compound, producing high variability in water-depth estimates. Overall, the pipeline's components interact, and ensemble approaches with uncertainty quantification are recommended. For flood mapping, method choice is the dominant influence; for water-depth estimation, the flood map input and its hyperparameters are the most influential processing step.

Conclusion: A pipeline-wide perspective is essential. Rather than relying on a single configuration, adopt ensemble strategies and explicitly account for methodological uncertainty across preprocessing, flood mapping, and depth estimation. This improves robustness and provides more reliable flood extent and depth estimates for hydraulic-model calibration.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step

### [184] [InternSVG: Towards Unified SVG Tasks with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11341)
*Haomin Wang,Jinhui Yin,Qi Wei,Wenguang Zeng,Lixin Gu,Shenglong Ye,Zhangwei Gao,Yaohui Wang,Yanting Zhang,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo,Wenhai Wang,Kai Chen,Yu Qiao,Hongjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal LLM framework (InternSVG) for SVG understanding, editing, and generation, built on a large SVG-centric data-benchmark-model stack (SAgoge, SArena) and a two-stage training pipeline, achieving strong cross-task transfer and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG modeling faces fragmented datasets, limited cross-task transferability, and high structural complexity. A unified data-benchmark-model approach leveraging multimodal LLMs can improve generalization and performance across SVG tasks.

Method: Introduce SAgoge, the largest multimodal SVG dataset covering static graphics and dynamic animations (icons, long-sequence illustrations, diagrams, animations); propose SArena, a comprehensive benchmark with standardized tasks and evaluation aligned to SAgoge's scope; develop InternSVG, an SVG-focused MLLM using SVG-specific tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy progressing from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and animations.

Result: InternSVG delivers substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary models on SArena and prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: A unified MLLM framework for SVG—underpinned by the SAgoge-SArena data-benchmark-model suite—effectively improves transferability and performance for understanding, editing, and generating SVG content.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

### [185] [MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11344)
*Hai Dang Nguyen,Nguyen Dang Huy Pham,The Minh Duc Nguyen,Dac Thai Nguyen,Hang Thi Nguyen,Duong M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAP uses multi-magnification patches and prototype embeddings to bridge histology–transcriptomics, achieving superior MAE/MSE/PCC over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent modality gap between H&E images and spatial gene expression, causing limited predictive performance. Capturing both fine-grained local details and broad global context is critical for accurate predictions.

Method: A dual-branch framework that (1) extracts multi-magnification patch representations for fine-grained local features, and (2) learns latent prototype embeddings to summarize slide-level/global information, forming a regression model to predict spatial transcriptomics.

Result: MMAP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across MAE, MSE, and Pearson correlation (PCC) on multiple datasets or evaluations.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-granularity local representations with prototype-based global context yields accurate, robust predictions of spatial gene expression from H&E WSIs, establishing a new baseline.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

### [186] [Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11346)
*Joshua Niemeijer,Jan Ehrhardt,Heinz Handels,Hristina Uzunova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A uncertainty-guided ControlNet approach enables augmenting labeled data by using unlabeled domain data with high uncertainty to generate annotated images across large domain shifts (e.g., Home-OCT) for segmentation, improving performance without extra supervision, and also demonstrated in traffic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNets tend to replicate the training distribution, limiting augmentation. The goal is to leverage unlabeled domains to broaden the effective distribution and produce labeled data in new domains for downstream tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Introduce two control signals in a ControlNet: uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset (indicating data outside the downstream task distribution) and semantic control from the labeled dataset. Train the network to synthesize annotated data from the unlabeled target domain with high uncertainty, enabling segmentation labels without additional supervision.

Result: Synthesized annotated data from the unlabeled domain (e.g., Home-OCT) yields significantly improved segmentation performance without extra labels, and the approach can handle arbitrary domain shifts better than style transfer; demonstrated also on traffic scene data.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided ControlNet enables robust generation of labeled synthetic data across domain shifts, reducing the need for labeled data in new domains and improving downstream segmentation performance when labels are scarce or unavailable.

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

### [187] [Reasoning as Representation: Rethinking Visual Reinforcement Learning in Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11369)
*Shijie Zhao,Xuanyu Zhang,Weiqi Li,Junlin Li,Li Zhang,Tianfan Xue,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-trained reasoning-based IQA models generalize by converting redundant visuals into compact cross-domain text representations; the RALI approach aligns images with these text representations via contrastive learning to avoid LLMs, achieving similar generalization with far fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based IQA models trained with reinforcement learning generalize well but are expensive in computation and energy; the mechanisms behind their generalization are not well understood, and reducing their resource footprint without sacrificing performance is desirable.

Method: 1) Analyze how RL training causes MLLMs to distill visual information into generalizable text representations. 2) Introduce RALI, a contrastive learning framework that directly aligns images with these text representations, eliminating the need for reasoning processes and LLMs. 3) Evaluate generalization performance and resource usage on IQA tasks, comparing to reasoning-based baselines.

Result: RALI achieves generalization comparable to reasoning-based models while using less than 5% of their parameters and inference time, effectively bypassing the LLM and reasoning overhead.

Conclusion: Direct image-text alignment with RL-derived representations can replicate the generalization of reasoning-based IQA models with vastly improved efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained settings; the approach suggests broader applicability to perception tasks beyond IQA and motivates further empirical validation across datasets and energy budgets.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

*Wenyuan Zhang,Jimin Tang,Weiqi Zhang,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-view consistent material inference for Gaussian Splatting with environment modeling via ray tracing, enabling physically-based reflections and state-of-the-art novel view rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing material inference for Gaussian-based splatting often lacks constraints under limited environment modeling, causing illumination aliasing and poor generalization in novel views.

Method: Enforce multi-view consistency of 2D Gaussian material maps during deferred shading; track photometric variations across views to locate highly reflective regions as priors for reflection strength; use ray-tracing-based environment modeling with 2D Gaussian Splatting to render indirect illumination.

Result: Experiments on widely used benchmarks show faithful recovery of illumination and geometry and state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel-view synthesis.

Conclusion: Multi-view-consistent material inference combined with robust environment modeling improves reflection estimation and photorealistic rendering with Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

### [189] [DocReward: A Document Reward Model for Structuring and Stylizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11391)
*Junpeng Liu,Yuzhong Zhao,Bowen Cao,Jiayu Ding,Yilin Jia,Tengchao Lv,Yupan Huang,Shaohan Huang,Nan Yang,Li Dong,Lei Cui,Tao Ge,Xun Wang,Huitian Jiao,Sun Mao,FNU Kartik,Si-Qing Chen,Wai Lam,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocReward proposes a document reward model to optimize structure and style in agentic document generation, using a large paired dataset DocPair and a Bradley-Terry loss; outperforms GPT-4o/5 baselines and improves extrinsic generation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where agentic workflows optimize textual quality but neglect visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability; lack of reward models that capture professionalism across domains.

Method: Create DocPair dataset with high/low professionalism documents sharing content, 117K pairs across 32 domains and 267 document types. Train a reward model with Bradley-Terry loss to score documents by professionalism. Construct a test bundle ranking dataset evaluated by educated humans. Evaluate reward model accuracy against baselines (GPT-4o, GPT-5) and extrinsic document generation win rate.

Result: DocReward outperforms GPT-4o (30.6 percentage points) and GPT-5 (19.4 percentage points) in accuracy on the test dataset. In extrinsic evaluation, win rate is 60.8% vs GPT-5's 37.7%, demonstrating utility in guiding generation agents toward human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: DocReward provides a structure- and style-aware reward model that is robust across domains and is agnostic to textual quality; the dataset and evaluation framework enable robust assessment and show practical gains in agentic document generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

*Yijun Hu,Bing Fan,Xin Gu,Haiqing Ren,Dongfang Liu,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LM-EEC: a SAM 2-based ego-exo correspondence method with long-term memories using a dual-memory MoE and a dual-memory bank, achieving state-of-the-art on EgoExo4D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish robust object-level correspondences between egocentric and exocentric views for better visual guidance, addressing challenges like extreme viewpoint changes, occlusions, and small objects, by leveraging long-term memory and adaptive feature fusion.

Method: Introduce a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive Memory-View MoE module. The MoE has a dual-branch routing mechanism that weights expert features along channel and spatial dimensions. A dual-memory bank compresses and stores long-term information, reducing redundancy while preserving critical content.

Result: On EgoExo4D, LM-EEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing existing methods and the SAM 2 baseline, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-EEC framework effectively addresses ego-exo correspondence by combining adaptive feature fusion with long-term memory, enabling robust performance in challenging egocentric-exocentric settings and highlighting SAM 2’s potential when augmented with memory mechanisms.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fusion of high-resolution satellite imagery with AIS using YOLOv11 enables near-real-time inland vessel detection and tracking, addressing AIS gaps by identifying non-cooperative targets and validating cooperative traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIS-based inland waterway monitoring is vulnerable to non-cooperative targets; leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and data fusion can improve Maritime Domain Awareness by providing fleet inventories, anomaly detection, and higher-quality data for surveillance.

Method: Utilizes YOLO v11 to detect and classify vessels from satellite imagery; annotates a dataset of 4,550 instances from 5,973 mi^2 of the Lower Mississippi River, capturing vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction. Fuses detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels and validate traffic. Evaluates on a held-out test set and conducts spatial transferability analysis across river segments.

Result: Vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, hopper barge): F1 = 95.8%. Barge cover (covered/uncovered): F1 = 91.6%. Operational status (staged/in motion): F1 = 99.4%. Directionality (upstream/downstream): 93.8% accuracy. Barge count MAE = 2.4. Spatial transferability accuracy across segments up to 98%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion for inland waterway surveillance, enabling near-real-time fleet inventories and anomaly detection. Future work includes expanding annotated datasets, incorporating temporal tracking, and exploring multi-modal deep learning to enhance scalability.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VLM-guided degradation-coupled fusion network (VGDCFusion) jointly models image degradation and fusion for infrared/visible image fusion, using SPDCE and JPDCF modules and vision-language models to handle degraded inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of existing IVIF methods under degraded inputs due to the decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion, which requires manual pre-processing and degrades performance.

Method: Propose VGDCFusion, a degradation-coupled fusion network guided by vision-language models. It includes Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) for modality-specific degradation awareness and joint degradation suppression with intra-modal feature extraction, and Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) for cross-modal degradation perception and fused residual degradation filtering with cross-modal feature fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective degradation-aware fusion via tight coupling of degradation modeling and fusion, guided by VLMs, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VA-GS framework enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting geometry for better surface reconstruction and view synthesis by integrating edge-aware cues, visibility-aware photometric alignment, normal-based constraints, and deep feature embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete and unstructured Gaussians with image-rendering losses can yield inaccurate geometry and misaligned views. There is a need for explicit geometric consistency across views and better handling of occlusions and lighting variations to improve surface reconstruction.

Method: Introduce view alignment (VA) for 3D Gaussian Splatting by (1) edge-aware rendering loss to sharpen boundaries, (2) visibility-aware photometric alignment to model occlusions and enforce spatial relationships among Gaussians, (3) normal-based constraints to refine Gaussian orientation for local surface estimation, and (4) deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency across viewpoints and illumination conditions.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis on standard benchmarks; comprehensive ablations validate the contribution of each component; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The proposed VA-GS framework significantly improves geometric fidelity and cross-view consistency in 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling more accurate surface reconstruction and robust novel view synthesis under varying lighting.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

### [195] [Towards Fast and Scalable Normal Integration using Continuous Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11508)
*Francesco Milano,Jen Jen Chung,Lionel Ott,Roland Siegwart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable surface normal integration method that treats the problem as estimating relative scales of continuous components, dramatically reducing optimization variables and enabling fast, high-quality reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface normal integration reconstructs depth from normals but current methods require heavy global optimization, which does not scale to large normal maps.

Method: Recast the problem as estimating relative scales across continuous components; enforce that pixels in the same component share a scale; introduce a heuristic to detect components, a rebalancing strategy for optimization terms, and an iterative merge process to further reduce variables.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on standard normal integration benchmark in a few seconds and yields about an order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Conclusion: Component-based relative-scale estimation provides a scalable, accurate solution for surface normal integration, enabling fast processing of large-scale normal maps.

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

### [196] [Situat3DChange: Situated 3D Change Understanding Dataset for Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11509)
*Ruiping Liu,Junwei Zheng,Yufan Chen,Zirui Wang,Kunyu Peng,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang,Marc Pollefeys,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Situat3DChange introduces a large-scale, situation-aware 3D dataset and an efficient 3D MLLM (SCReasoner) to advance perception–action understanding in dynamic scenes, with promising cross-domain transfer but notable limitations remaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D benchmarks isolate dynamicity (scene changes or situational context) and fail to support joint perception and action understanding. A unified, situation-aware dataset and lightweight MLLM reasoning are needed to enable robust human–AI collaboration in dynamic environments.

Method: Situat3DChange compiles 121K QA pairs, 36K change descriptions, and 17K rearrangement instructions across 11K human-observed changes, incorporating egocentric/allocentric views and categorical/coordinate spatial relations, aided by an LLM to fuse these observations into shared situational models. It also introduces SCReasoner, a parameter-efficient 3D MLLM that performs point-cloud comparison with minimal extra tokens and no language-decoder expansion. Evaluation examines dynamic scene and situation understanding, data scaling, and cross-domain transfer.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation reveals progress and remaining limitations of MLLMs for dynamic scene/situation understanding. Scaling data and cross-domain transfer demonstrate task-agnostic effectiveness of Situat3DChange as training data for MLLMs.

Conclusion: Situat3DChange enables three situation-aware tasks and, with SCReasoner, supports efficient, cross-domain 3D multi-modal understanding; the work highlights potential for improved human–AI collaboration in dynamic environments while signaling areas for further improvement (e.g., richer reasoning, generalization).

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

*Jianhao Yuan,Fabio Pizzati,Francesco Pinto,Lars Kunze,Ivan Laptev,Paul Newman,Philip Torr,Daniele De Martini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces LikePhys, a training-free metric to evaluate intuitive physics in video diffusion models by using a denoising objective as an ELBO-like likelihood on valid/invalid video pairs, producing a Plausibility Preference Error (PPE) that aligns with human preferences and benchmarks model physics understanding across 12 scenarios in 4 physics domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reliably assess intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models separately from visual appearance, addressing the challenge of disentangling physics correctness from stylistic generation quality.

Method: LikePhys evaluates physically valid vs. impossible videos with the denoising objective treated as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated valid-invalid dataset. It defines PPE (Plausibility Preference Error) as the evaluation metric and benchmarks twelve scenarios across four physics domains on current video diffusion models.

Result: PPE shows strong alignment with human preference and outperforms baselines. Systematic benchmarks reveal how model design and inference settings affect physics understanding, with capacity scaling improving performance; complex/chaotic dynamics remain challenging and there are domain-specific variations in physical law understanding.

Conclusion: Provides a training-free, principled evaluation framework for intuitive physics in video diffusion models and emphasizes capacity- and inference-driven improvements, while highlighting persistent difficulties with chaotic dynamics and domain-specific variations.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

*Kedi Ying,Ruiping Liu,Chongyan Chen,Mingzhe Tao,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmWalk is a large simulated multi-modal dataset and VQA benchmark designed to enable outdoor safe walking assistance for blind/low-vision users. It includes 120 trajectories with 62k frames and 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities, plus mmWalkVQA with 69k QA triplets. State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models underperform on risk assessment and navigation tasks; a mmWalk-finetuned model shows effectiveness on real-world data, demonstrating dataset utility for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of holistic scene understanding and real-world navigation support for visually impaired individuals. Create realistic, accessibility-focused data to drive progress in safe outdoor walking assistance.

Method: Develop mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset with 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories, totaling 62k synchronized frames and 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Include outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks. Create mmWalkVQA with 69k visual QA triplets across 9 categories relevant to safe walking. Evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models in zero- and few-shot settings; fine-tune mmWalk on data and validate on real-world datasets.

Result: Current VLMs struggle with risk assessment and navigational tasks in this domain. A mmWalk-finetuned model performs better on real-world data, demonstrating the dataset’s effectiveness for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

Conclusion:  mmWalk provides realistic, task-relevant benchmarks for multi-modal navigation assistance, highlighting gaps in existing VLMs and offering a path toward more robust, accessible outdoor navigation tools for BLV users.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

### [199] [Massive Activations are the Key to Local Detail Synthesis in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11538)
*Chaofan Gan,Zicheng Zhao,Yuanpeng Tu,Xi Chen,Ziran Qin,Tieyuan Chen,Mehrtash Harandi,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Massive Activations (MAs) in Diffusion Transformers govern local detail synthesis with minimal impact on overall semantics. The paper introduces Detail Guidance (DG), a training-free self-guidance method that degrades MAs to steer the model toward higher-fidelity local details, and can be combined with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). DG consistently improves fine-grained details across multiple pre-trained DiTs (e.g., SD3, SD3.5, Flux).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the role of internal Massive Activations (MAs) in diffusion transformers and improve local detail fidelity in generated visuals.

Method: Systematic analysis of MA distributions across spatial tokens and timesteps; show MAs’ connection to local detail; devise DG by creating a degraded 'detail-deficient' model via MA disruption; apply DG as a self-guidance signal to the original network; can be combined with predicted CFG guidance for further refinement.

Result: DG consistently enhances fine-grained detail quality across multiple pre-trained DiTs (including SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Conclusion: Massive Activations are key to local detail synthesis in DiTs; a simple, training-free DG approach can boost detail fidelity and complements existing CFG-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

### [200] [ODI-Bench: Can MLLMs Understand Immersive Omnidirectional Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11549)
*Liu Yang,Huiyu Duan,Ran Tao,Juntao Cheng,Sijing Wu,Yunhao Li,Jing Liu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ODI-Bench, a 2k-ODI, 4k QA benchmark for 10 tasks to evaluate MLLMs on omnidirectional images; shows current models underperform and introduces Omni-CoT, a training-free chain-of-thought method to boost ODI understanding, with results suggesting improvement and code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel on conventional 2D data but struggle with immersive omnidirectional environments; a dedicated benchmark and a training-free method are needed to push understanding of ODIs.

Method: Construct ODI-Bench with 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and 4,000 manually annotated QA pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks (general and spatial understanding). Benchmark 20 representative MLLMs under close-ended and open-ended settings. Propose Omni-CoT, a training-free chain-of-thought approach that combines textual information and visual cues to enhance ODI comprehension.

Result: Experimental results show current MLLMs struggle to capture immersive context in ODIs. Omni-CoT significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension in omnidirectional environments. The benchmark and code will be released.

Conclusion: ODI understanding remains challenging, but ODI-Bench provides a targeted evaluation platform and Omni-CoT offers a promising direction to improve MLLM performance in immersive ODI scenarios; future work may extend tasks and models and release resources.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

### [201] [How many samples to label for an application given a foundation model? Chest X-ray classification study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11553)
*Nikolay Nechaev,Evgenia Przhezdzetskaya,Viktor Gombolevskiy,Dmitry Umerenkov,Dmitry Dylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Power-law learning curves predict the labeling needed to reach target ROC-AUC in chest X-ray classification. Foundation models XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with far fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline, and learning-curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases can forecast the final performance plateau, enabling annotation-cost minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging models typically require large labeled datasets. This work investigates whether power-law fits can forecast the amount of labeled data needed to reach specified diagnostic performance, helping practitioners budget annotation efforts when using foundation models.

Method: Fit power-law learning curves to ROC-AUC as a function of labeled sample size across multiple chest X-ray pathologies and foundation models (XrayCLIP, XraySigLIP, and ResNet-50). Compare performance with varying label counts and assess whether early slopes (from 50 labeled cases) predict the eventual performance plateau.

Result: XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP reach strong ROC-AUC with substantially fewer labeled samples than ResNet-50. Slopes estimated from 50 labeled cases accurately forecast the final performance plateau, enabling early budgeting of annotation efforts.

Conclusion: Power-law-based data budgeting can significantly reduce annotation costs for chest X-ray classification using foundation models by identifying the essential labeled samples needed to achieve target performance.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

### [202] [SNAP: Towards Segmenting Anything in Any Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11565)
*Aniket Gupta,Hanhui Wang,Charles Saunders,Aruni RoyChowdhury,Hanumant Singh,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNAP is a unified, cross-domain interactive 3D segmentation model that supports both point-based and text-based prompts. Trained on 7 diverse datasets (indoor, outdoor, aerial) with domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer, it generates text-prompt proposals via CLIP and achieves strong zero-shot performance across most benchmarks, matching or exceeding domain-specific methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D segmentation methods are often domain-specific, rely on a single type of user interaction, and suffer from negative transfer when trained on multiple datasets. A unified, generalizable tool is needed for scalable 3D annotation across varied environments and prompting modalities.

Method: Introduce SNAP, a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across domains. Train on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial scenes with domain-adaptive normalization to mitigate negative transfer. For text prompts, automatically generate mask proposals and match them to CLIP embeddings of textual queries to enable panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation.

Result: SNAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and matches or competes well on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks, demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization and the benefit of a unified approach.

Conclusion: A single, domain-aware yet generalizable model can deliver high-quality 3D segmentation across diverse environments and prompting modalities, offering a practical, scalable tool for 3D annotation.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

### [203] [A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567)
*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based framework adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target urban domain using imperfect pseudo-labels, producing high-fidelity, domain-aligned images from semantic maps to improve segmentation. It filters poor generations, fixes image-label misalignments, and standardizes semantics, enabling weak synthetic data to rival real-domain training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data lag behind real imagery, especially for domain-specific adaptation like Cityscapes. Differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance; expensive 3D modeling for better realism undermines the low-cost benefits of synthetic data.

Method: Fine-tune/adapt a pre-trained diffusion model to a target domain using imperfect pseudo-labels. At inference, generate target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset. Apply filtering of suboptimal generations, rectify image-label misalignments, and standardize semantics across datasets to produce high-quality, domain-aligned training data.

Result: Across five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets, achieved segmentation gains up to 8.0 percentage points in mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods. Demonstrates that rapidly constructed synthetic data can be competitive with more expensive, manually designed synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables fast, scalable creation of high-quality, target-aligned training data for urban-scene understanding by combining rapid semantic prototyping with generative models, reducing cost and time while maintaining performance gains.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models can map cereals from hyperspectral data, with SpectralEarth pre-trained ViT achieving the highest accuracy (~93.5% OA), outperforming DOFA (~62.6%) and HyperSigma (~34.5%); a scratch SpectralEarth variant ~91% emphasizes architecture’s role in cross-region generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how foundation models perform on hyperspectral cereal crop mapping, across different architectures and pre-training datasets, and to assess generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms.

Method: Benchmark three foundation models (HyperSigma, DOFA, SpectralEarth ViT) pre-trained on the SpectralEarth hyperspectral archive; fine-tune on labeled data from a training region; evaluate on an independent test region using OA, AA, and F1-score (mean ± standard deviation); compare with a compact SpectralEarth model trained from scratch.

Result: HyperSigma: OA 34.5% ±1.8%; DOFA: OA 62.6% ±3.5%; SpectralEarth ViT: OA 93.5% ±0.8%. A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved 91% OA. AA and F1-score are evaluated but specific values are not reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational hyperspectral crop mapping and highlights the importance of model architecture for strong cross-regional and cross-sensor generalization, outlining directions for future model development.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

### [205] [MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11579)
*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix introduces emotion-aware Mixup for multimodal sentiment analysis to address semantic confusion from naive mixing; it uses SASS for sample selection, SIG to compute modality-specific mixing ratios via sentiment intensities, and SAL with KL regularization to align predictions; results show consistent improvements across three datasets and six backbones; code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of multimodal annotated data; naive Mixup amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency when mixing samples from different modalities/emotions.

Method: Three components: SASS selects samples to avoid contradictory emotions; SIG uses multi-head self-attention to compute mixing ratios per modality based on emotional intensity; SAL aligns distributions across modalities and includes KL-based regularization to train intensity predictor and backbone.

Result: Three benchmark datasets, six backbones; MS-Mix outperforms existing methods; establishes new standard for robust multimodal augmentation.

Conclusion: Emotion-aware augmentation via MS-Mix effectively improves MSA performance; provides adaptable, interpretable mixing and alignment; code released.”

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

*Leonard Bruns,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Áron Monszpart,Sowmya Munukutla,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE-G splits the SCR pipeline into a generic transformer-based map and a scene-specific map code, enabling pre-training on many scenes to improve generalization and robustness in visual relocalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR models overfit to training views and struggle with different lighting/viewpoints; a generalizable mapping from images to scene coordinates is needed.

Method: Replace the coordinate regressor with a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code; pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes and train it to generalize to unseen query images during pre-training; keep computation efficient.

Result: ACE-G demonstrates significantly improved robustness to appearance and viewpoint changes across multiple relocalization datasets, while maintaining an attractive computational footprint.

Conclusion: Separating map representation from the regressor enables better generalization in SCR, making SCR more competitive with classical feature-based relocalization.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpVid introduces the first benchmark to evaluate multimodal LLMs on scientific experiment videos, revealing gaps in fine-grained perception, state-tracking, and reasoning with a roadmap for future development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that existing benchmarks overlook the fine-grained, long-horizon nature of wet-lab work, and to enable trustworthy MLLMs that can interpret experimental procedures and connect them to published conclusions.

Method: A vision-centric annotation pipeline and three-level task hierarchy (perception, procedural understanding, scientific reasoning); curated from peer-reviewed videos; automated generation plus multidisciplinary expert validation.

Result: Evaluated 19 leading MLLMs; models perform well on coarse recognition but struggle with fine details, state changes, and linking procedures to outcomes; proprietary models outperform open-source in high-level reasoning.

Conclusion: ExpVid serves as a diagnostic tool and roadmap to develop MLLMs capable of assisting scientific experimentation with trustworthy, explainable reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

### [208] [High-resolution Photo Enhancement in Real-time: A Laplacian Pyramid Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11613)
*Feng Zhang,Haoyou Deng,Zhiqiang Li,Lida Li,Bin Xu,Qingbo Lu,Zisheng Cao,Minchen Wei,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast, high-quality photo enhancement method LLF-LUT++ uses a pyramid Laplacian-based architecture with adaptive 3D LUTs and a frequency-aware transformer, delivering strong enhancement with real-time 4K performance on a single GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current photo enhancement methods face a trade-off between enhancement quality and efficiency, hindering deployment on edge devices and real-world use for high-resolution images.

Method: LLF-LUT++ integrates global and local operators via closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition/reconstruction. It employs an image-adaptive 3D LUT leveraging global tonal characteristics from downsampled images, with two weight fusion strategies for coarse global enhancement. A spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor extracts distinct weights using frequency features. Local Laplacian filters refine edge details in high-frequency components. The architecture and transformer are redesigned to improve both performance and speed.

Result: On the HDR+ dataset, LLF-LUT++ achieves a 2.64 dB PSNR improvement. It processes 4K images in ~13 ms on a single GPU, and experiments on two benchmarks show favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++ delivers fast, high-quality photo enhancement suitable for real-world deployment, balancing global tone adaptation with local detail preservation, and will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

*Tobias Preintner,Weixuan Yuan,Adrian König,Thomas Bäck,Elena Raponi,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoCAD combines large language models with evolutionary search to generate CAD objects from symbolic representations, achieving superior topological correctness on CADPrompt using Euler-characteristic-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the generative and reasoning strengths of LLMs and vision-language models alongside evolutionary optimization to produce CAD objects that are not only visually plausible but also topologically correct.

Method: Sample multiple CAD objects and optimize them via an evolutionary algorithm guided by vision-language and reasoning LLMs (GPT-4V / GPT-4o). Evaluate on the CADPrompt benchmark and introduce two new topology-based metrics derived from Euler characteristics to measure semantic similarity between 3D objects.

Result: EvoCAD outperforms prior methods on multiple metrics, with a notable improvement in generating topologically correct objects. The two Euler-characteristic-based metrics complement existing spatial metrics in evaluating CAD objects.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with evolutionary optimization is effective for CAD generation from symbolic representations, and the proposed Euler-characteristic metrics provide meaningful, topology-aware evaluation of 3D objects.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

### [210] [NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11632)
*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D introduces per-voxel normal-vector features derived from local voxel neighborhoods (via KNN+PCA) to enrich 3D features for detection, with two sampling strategies to prune data (Density-based and FOV-aware bin-based). It uses element-wise attention fusion and achieves higher KITTI mAP than Voxel R-CNN, especially for cars and cyclists, even with ~55% voxel reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal and local-pattern approaches struggle with feature alignment and oversimplified local feature extraction for complex 3D object detection. There is a need for robust, local geometric cues that relate surface orientations to target objects (cars, pedestrians, cyclists) using LiDAR alone.

Method: Compute per-voxel normal vectors from voxel neighborhoods using KNN and PCA. Use two sampling strategies: (1) normal vector density-based sampling and (2) FOV-aware bin-based sampling to reduce data (up to ~55%). Apply element-wise attention fusion with voxel features as query/value and normal-vector features as key. Train and evaluate on the KITTI dataset for car and cyclist detection.

Result: NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mAP (car and cyclist) over baseline Voxel R-CNN by +2.61% and +4.23%. With both sampling methods, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP for car detection, exceeding baseline by +1.56%, despite roughly 55% voxel filtering. Demonstrates improvements in detecting spatially shaped objects (cars, cyclists) by leveraging local normal cues and feature fusion.

Conclusion: Incorporating locally derived normal-vector features via KNN+PCA and pairing them with attention-based fusion yields improved 3D object detection on KITTI, with data-efficiency through intelligent sampling. Particularly beneficial for cars and cyclists due to their geometry.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

*Yinan Chen,Jiangning Zhang,Teng Hu,Yuxiang Zeng,Zhucun Xue,Qingdong He,Chengjie Wang,Yong Liu,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark IVEBench for instruction-guided video editing with 600 source videos, 7 semantic dimensions, lengths 32–1024 frames, 8 editing categories with 35 subcategories; tri-dimensional evaluation (video quality, instruction compliance, video fidelity) using traditional metrics and multimodal LLM-based assessments; demonstrates effectiveness for evaluating SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately support instruction-guided video editing, lacking source diversity, task coverage, and comprehensive evaluation metrics; need a standardized, human-aligned benchmark.

Method: Assemble IVEBench: 600 high-quality source videos across seven semantic dimensions; capture lengths 32–1024 frames; define 8 editing categories with 35 subcategories; generate/refine prompts via large language models and expert review; establish a three-dimensional evaluation protocol combining traditional metrics and multimodal LLM-based assessments.

Result: Extensive experiments show IVEBench effectively benchmarks state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods and yields comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: IVEBench addresses evaluation gaps in instruction-guided video editing and provides a robust, diverse, multimodal benchmark to accelerate progress in the field.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

*Pradyumna Yalandur Muralidhar,Yuxuan Xue,Xianghui Xie,Margaret Kostyrko,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhySIC: a single-image framework that reconstructs metrically accurate humans, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps in a shared frame, with occlusion-aware inpainting and physics-guided optimization; achieves plausible multi-human interactions in seconds and significantly improves scene accuracy, pose error, and contact detection over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing accurate human-scale geometry and their interactions with the surrounding scene from a single RGB image is essential for virtual reality, robotics, and 3D scene understanding, but faces depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts.

Method: Start from coarse monocular depth and body estimates, apply occlusion-aware inpainting, fuse visible depth with an unscaled geometry to build a metric scaffold, and synthesize missing support surfaces (e.g., floors). Use a confidence-weighted optimization to refine body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency, with explicit occlusion masking. Enables multi-human scenarios and reports ~9 s for joint optimization and <27 s end-to-end.

Result: Outperforms single-image baselines: reduces mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halves PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and increases contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic foot-floor interaction, seating, and reconstruction of heavily occluded furniture.

Conclusion: PhySIC converts a single image into a physically plausible 3D human–scene pair, advancing scalable 3D scene understanding and enabling realistic human-scene interaction reconstructions from monocular images.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfiniHuman distills foundation models to generate unlimited, richly annotated 3D human data and a diffusion-based avatar generator for controllable avatars, enabling scalable, low-cost high-quality generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle data scarcity and expensive annotation in 3D human avatar creation; enable broad diversity (ethnicity, age, clothing, body shapes) through foundation-model distillation.

Method: Introduce InfiniHuman: InfiniHumanData automatically constructs a large multi-modal dataset (111K identities) via vision-language and image-generation models with multi-granularity text, multi-view RGB, detailed clothing, and SMPL shapes; InfiniHumanGen a diffusion-based generator conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets for controllable avatar creation.

Result: User study reports generated identities indistinguishable from scan renderings; dataset spans unprecedented diversity; reported improvements over state-of-the-art in visual quality, speed, and controllability; plan to publicly release data pipeline, dataset, and models.

Conclusion: InfiniHuman enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through automatic data generation, offering a practical, affordable path to scalable 3D human data and avatars.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

### [214] [FACE: Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11675)
*Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Sara Rampazzi,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACE proposes Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction by augmenting NMF with KL-divergence regularization and classifier supervision to align concept-based explanations with the model's decisions, yielding faithful, sparse concepts with local linearity guarantees and improved faithfulness over prior methods on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic concept discovery methods struggle to align extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, leading to less faithful explanations. There is a need for concept discovery that ensures predictive fidelity to the original model.

Method: Augment Non-negative Matrix Factorization with a KL-divergence regularization term to align concept-based predictions with the model's predictions. Incorporate classifier supervision during concept learning to enforce predictive consistency. Provide theoretical guarantees that minimizing KL divergence bounds deviation in predictive distributions, promoting faithful local linearity in the concept space.

Result: Empirical results on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA show FACE outperforms existing methods in faithfulness and sparsity metrics. The approach yields more faithful explanations and sparser concept representations, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: FACE offers a principled framework for faithful concept discovery by tying concept learning directly to the model's predictive behavior, enabling more faithful and interpretable explanations across large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, category-agnostic method estimates 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image without templates, achieving real-time performance and strong zero-shot generalization across 300+ categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on object-specific priors (CAD/models) and limited cross-category generalization caused by pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines, enabling open-set 6D understanding for robotics.

Method: Fuse dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts. Use parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and dense shape reconstruction. Train solely on synthetic data (149 categories from the SOPE dataset).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects across four benchmarks (SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, HANDAL), at 28 FPS.

Conclusion: Presents a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI with a category-agnostic, end-to-end framework that does not rely on templates or category labels at test time.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

### [216] [Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690)
*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Repalces VAE encoders in diffusion transformers with Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) built from pretrained representation encoders and trained decoders, yielding high-dimensional, semantically rich latent spaces and faster convergence; achieves strong ImageNet results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE-based encoders in Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are outdated and constrain performance: limited backbones, low latent dimensionality, and weak, reconstruction-focused representations that cap generation quality. A more semantically rich, scalable latent space is needed.

Method: Replace the VAE encoder with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trainable decoders to form Representation Autoencoders (RAEs); address high-dimensional latent spaces to enable diffusion transformers to operate effectively; provide theoretically motivated solutions to diffusion in high-dim latent spaces; avoid auxiliary alignment losses; deploy DiT with a lightweight, wide DDT head.

Result: RAEs enable faster convergence and strong ImageNet generation: 1.51 FID at 256x256 without guidance and 1.13 FID at 256x256 and 512x512 with guidance; improved reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces; advantages suggest RAEs should be the default for diffusion transformer training.

Conclusion: RAEs offer clear advantages over traditional VAE-based latent encoders and should become the default latent modeling strategy for diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian topological CNN combining topology-aware learning with Bayesian sampling to improve data efficiency, calibration, and uncertainty quantification, especially with limited/corrupted data and for OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs require large datasets and often produce overconfident predictions with poor uncertainty estimates. Integrating topology-aware learning with Bayesian inference aims to enhance data efficiency, calibration, and reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: Introduce a topology-informed learning framework that uses manifold information to accelerate training, place prior distributions on network parameters, and learn appropriate posteriors. A consistency condition in the learning cost is included to adapt priors. The model is evaluated on benchmark image classification datasets against CNNs, BNNs, and topological CNNs.

Result: The proposed model shows superiority over conventional CNNs, BNNs, and topological CNNs, particularly when training data are limited or corrupted. It provides better uncertainty quantification and improves out-of-distribution detection capability.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach that merges topology-aware learning with Bayesian inference can yield more efficient, robust image classification, with potential applicability beyond standard CNNs and better resilience to data limitations and distributional shifts.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360 is a DiT-based framework for hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data to improve panoramic image generation, using cross-domain guidance and token-level losses to boost boundary fidelity and realism, with strong results on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main bottleneck for geometric fidelity and photorealism in panoramic generation is the scarcity of large-scale real-world panoramic data; a data-centric approach is needed rather than solely focusing on model design.

Method: Proposes inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at pre-VAE image level and post-VAE token level. Image-level: cross-domain perspective guidance and panoramic refinement. Token-level: hybrid supervision including circular padding, yaw loss, and cube loss. Applies to text-to-panorama, inpainting, outpainting.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics on multiple tasks; publicly available code.

Conclusion: DiT360 demonstrates that hybrid training with domain-aware augmentation and specialized losses yields better panoramic generation under data constraints, reinforcing a data-centric view and offering practical modules for future work.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot point tracking can be achieved by prompting pretrained video diffusion models to visually mark moving points, propagating a colored marker across frames via counterfactual generation, and leveraging the initial frame as a negative prompt to keep the marker visible; emergent tracks outperform prior zero-shot methods and rival self-supervised trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connect tracking and video generation to exploit the generative power of diffusion models for tracking tasks without additional training.

Method: Place a distinctive colored marker at the query point in the initial frame. Prompt the video diffusion model to regenerate the video from an intermediate noise level, causing the marker to propagate across frames and trace the trajectory. Use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt to keep the marker visible in the counterfactual generation. Evaluate across multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models and compare to existing zero-shot and self-supervised trackers.

Result: Emergent tracks outperform prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions; in many cases the performance approaches that of specialized self-supervised trackers.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models can be repurposed for tracking tasks without additional training by using marker-based prompting and counterfactual generation, enabling competitive zero-shot tracking performance.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

### [220] [Ev4DGS: Novel-view Rendering of Non-Rigid Objects from Monocular Event Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11717)
*Takuya Nakabayashi,Navami Kairanda,Hideo Saito,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Ev4DGS, the first method to render novel views of non-rigid objects directly from monocular event streams in the image space, using deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting supervised by 2D event-space losses and a coarse 3D deformation model learned from event-derived masks; outperforms naive baselines and will release code and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have advantages for view synthesis and efficient, rigid-scene methods exist, but non-rigid cases typically rely on RGB inputs. It remains unresolved whether models can be learned from events alone. This work addresses that gap by enabling non-rigid view synthesis from monocular event streams.

Method: Estimate a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation. Train with two losses: (i) alignment between the rendered outputs and the 2D event observation space, and (ii) a coarse 3D deformation model learned from masks generated from events. Requires only monocular event streams without RGB inputs.

Result: Experimental comparisons on synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects show Ev4DGS yields valid results and superior performance relative to several naive baselines in this setting.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS demonstrates the feasibility of learning non-rigid novel view rendering from monocular events in the explicit observation space, leveraging a deformable Gaussian Splatting representation and event-derived supervision, with released datasets and code to support future research.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

### [221] [CodePlot-CoT: Mathematical Visual Reasoning by Thinking with Code-Driven Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11718)
*Chengqi Duan,Kaiyue Sun,Rongyao Fang,Manyuan Zhang,Yan Feng,Ying Luo,Yufang Liu,Ke Wang,Peng Pei,Xunliang Cai,Hongsheng Li,Yi Ma,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodePlot-CoT introduces a code-driven chain-of-thought paradigm for mathematical problems requiring visual reasoning. It uses a large bilingual Math-VR dataset, an image-to-code parser, and a model that renders plotting code into images as visual thoughts, achieving up to 21% gains on their benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs/VLMs struggle with problems needing visual aids and precise, controllable reasoning. There is a lack of large-scale bilingual visual-reasoning math data and robust figure-to-code tools to support such tasks.

Method: 1) Construct Math-VR, a large-scale bilingual dataset (178k samples) for math with visual reasoning. 2) Develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter to parse complex mathematical figures into code. 3) Train CodePlot-CoT to generate text reasoning and executable plotting code, render code output as images ('visual thought'), and solve problems. 4) Evaluate on the new benchmark and compare to base models.

Result: CodePlot-CoT achieves up to 21% improvements over the base model on Math-VR_CodePlot-CoT benchmark, validating the effectiveness of code-driven multimodal reasoning. The authors release datasets, code, and pretrained models.

Conclusion: The work introduces a new multimodal reasoning paradigm that combines text, code, and images for mathematics, offers the first large-scale dataset and benchmark for visual reasoning in math, and lays groundwork for future research on “thinking with images.” The resources are publicly available to facilitate community research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

*Peilin He,Zakk Heile,Jayson Tran,Alice Wang,Shrikant Chand*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces RISWIE, a scalable rigid-invariant sliced Wasserstein method via independent embeddings that achieves near-linear complexity and improves clustering/discrimination over GW while reducing runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning probability measures under unknown rigid transformations is key for shape matching and ML; classical OT and SW are rotation/reflection sensitive, GW is isometry-invariant but computationally costly; a scalable rigid-invariant proxy is needed.

Method: RISWIE uses data-adaptive bases and independent embeddings to align optimal signed permutations along axes based on distributional similarity, combining invariant properties with projection-based OT to achieve rigid invariance with near-linear complexity in sample size; provides bounds to GW in special cases.

Result: Dimension-independent statistical stability demonstrated; empirical results on cellular imaging and 3D human meshes show RISWIE outperforms GW in clustering and discriminative tasks while significantly reducing runtime.

Conclusion: RISWIE offers a scalable, rigid-invariant alternative to GW with theoretical connections to GW in certain regimes and strong empirical performance; it bridges the gap between NP-hard rigid invariance and efficient OT-based methods.

Abstract: Comparing probability measures when their supports are related by an unknown
rigid transformation is an important challenge in geometric data analysis,
arising in shape matching and machine learning. Classical optimal transport
(OT) distances, including Wasserstein and sliced Wasserstein, are sensitive to
rotations and reflections, while Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) is invariant to
isometries but computationally prohibitive for large datasets. We introduce
\emph{Rigid-Invariant Sliced Wasserstein via Independent Embeddings} (RISWIE),
a scalable pseudometric that combines the invariance of NP-hard approaches with
the efficiency of projection-based OT. RISWIE utilizes data-adaptive bases and
matches optimal signed permutations along axes according to distributional
similarity to achieve rigid invariance with near-linear complexity in the
sample size. We prove bounds relating RISWIE to GW in special cases and
empirically demonstrate dimension-independent statistical stability. Our
experiments on cellular imaging and 3D human meshes demonstrate that RISWIE
outperforms GW in clustering tasks and discriminative capability while
significantly reducing runtime.

### [223] [Enhancing Diffusion Policy with Classifier-Free Guidance for Temporal Robotic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09786)
*Yuang Lu,Song Wang,Xiao Han,Xuri Zhang,Yucong Wu,Zhicheng He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-policy framework CFG-DP uses classifier-free guidance to incorporate task progression signals for temporal coherence and controlled termination in sequential humanoid robot tasks, improving success rates and reducing repetitive actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal sequential tasks suffer from lack of temporal context in existing DP and ACT methods, leading to local optima traps and repetitive actions. A mechanism to track task phase and terminate cycles is needed.

Method: Integrates Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with diffusion-policy using both conditional and unconditional models. Uses timestep inputs to track task progression and guide action predictions through a tunable guidance factor that balances temporal coherence and action accuracy. Evaluates component roles and parameter effects through real-world humanoid-robot experiments focusing on action termination and reliability.

Result: Demonstrates high task success rates and minimal repetitive actions in real-world robot experiments. Shows improved termination of actions and analyzes how different components and parameter choices influence performance, leading to enhanced deterministic control and execution reliability for sequential tasks.

Conclusion: CFG-DP meaningfully improves diffusion-policy-based control for sequential robotic tasks by leveraging CFG to incorporate task phase information, achieving better temporal coherence, action termination, and reliability in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

*Samanta Rodriguez,Yiming Dou,Miquel Oller,Andrew Owens,Nima Fazeli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two cross-sensor touch generation methods, Touch2Touch (end-to-end with paired data) and T2D2 (depth-based, unpaired), enable translating tactile images across sensors to reuse sensor-specific models; demonstrated on in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuo-tactile sensors vary widely; current models are tied to a specific sensor, hindering generalization. A sensor-agnostic translation framework can unlock cross-sensor model reuse.

Method: Touch2Touch uses paired data to learn an end-to-end translation between tactile images from different sensors. T2D2 introduces an intermediate depth representation, enabling cross-sensor translation without paired data. Both produce cross-sensor tactile images to apply sensor-specific models across sensors.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning; models trained on one sensor can be transferred to another.

Conclusion: Offers flexible cross-sensor translation solutions that adapt to data availability and application needs, facilitating broader cross-sensor deployment of tactile models.

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

### [225] [VG-Mapping: Variation-Aware 3D Gaussians for Online Semi-static Scene Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09962)
*Yicheng He,Jingwen Yu,Guangcheng Chen,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VG-Mapping introduces a hybrid online mapping system for semi-static scenes that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a TSDF voxel map to detect changes and adjust Gaussian densities, enabling efficient map updates and improved rendering; it also provides a new RGB-D dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain up-to-date maps for robots revisiting the same spaces. In semi-static environments, failing to promptly update changed regions degrades map quality, localization, and efficiency. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with efficient and accurate change updates.

Method: Propose a hybrid representation that augments 3D Gaussian Splatting with a TSDF-based voxel map to identify changed regions. Implement a variation-aware density control strategy to insert or delete Gaussian primitives in regions undergoing change. Construct an RGB-D dataset (synthetic and real-world) for semi-static environments to benchmark the approach.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvements in rendering quality and map update efficiency for semi-static scenes. The method outperforms baseline approaches on the newly created dataset, and the authors release code and dataset for public use.

Conclusion: VG-Mapping provides an effective online mapping framework for semi-static environments by coupling 3DGS with TSDF-based change detection and density adaptation. It advances map maintenance for navigational tasks and contributes a publicly available dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/heyicheng-never/VG-Mapping.

*Chaoran Wang,Jingyuan Sun,Yanhui Zhang,Mingyu Zhang,Changju Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM-driven dynamic behavior tree (BT) construction for heterogeneous multi-robot teams, using four interconnected modules (task initialization, task assignment, BT update, failure detection) and a centralized virtual coordinator to replan and synchronize BTs. Demonstrated in 60 tasks across simulations and a real-world cafe with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot, outperforming baselines on success, robustness, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robots have fixed functional attributes and limited reconfigurability, leading to poor adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. There is a need for adaptive coupling between planning (via LLMs) and execution (via BTs) to support long-term cooperative behavior.

Method: A four-module loop: (1) task initialization, (2) task assignment, (3) BT update, (4) failure node detection. Robots tick BTs during execution; upon failure, they can extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator (Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. LLMs generate and extend BTs dynamically, leveraging reasoning/generalization with the modularity/recovery of BTs. Validation across 60 tasks in simulations and a real cafe setup with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate, robustness, and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-guided BT framework enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous robot teams and is effective for multi-robot collaboration in complex, dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

### [227] [FORM: Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping utilizing Rotating LiDAR Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09966)
*Easton R. Potokar,Taylor Pool,Daniel McGann,Michael Kaess*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time LiDAR odometry method that smooths over a fixed-lag graph with reparative mapping to keep a consistent local map.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submap-based and multi-scan matching LO methods either require multiple scans and are not real-time, or propagate errors into fixed submaps, causing jitter and degraded future registrations.

Method: Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping (FORM) uses a densely connected factor graph over a fixed-time lag and performs smoothing, while using a single iterative local map for matching to allow real-time updates and active map repair as poses are refined.

Result: FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and yields smooth trajectories across diverse datasets, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

Conclusion: FORM demonstrates that combining smoothing with a reparative local map enables real-time, smooth LiDAR odometry by mitigating submap error propagation.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

*Jingyuan Sun,Hongyu Ji,Zihan Qu,Chaoran Wang,Mingyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces ATRos, an RL-based hybrid locomotion framework for wheeled-legged robots that coordinates wheels and legs without predefined gait patterns, achieving better terrain adaptability and energy efficiency, validated in simulation and real-world tests on diverse terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid wheeled-legged robots promise both agility and efficiency, but achieving robust, end-to-end whole-body control without relying on fixed gaits is challenging; need adaptable, energy-efficient planning across varied terrains.

Method: Proposes ATRos: an RL-based planner that forecasts environmental states from proprioceptive data using a prediction policy network, feeding into an actor-critic network to generate joint commands. The system coordinates simultaneous wheel and leg movements without predefined gaits, enabling hybrid walking-driving locomotion. Validation includes simulations and real-world experiments on flat ground, stairs, and grass.

Result: The framework achieves robust hybrid locomotion with improved terrain adaptability and energy efficiency, generalizing well to unseen terrains in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: An RL-based, gait-free planner (ATRos) can effectively coordinate wheels and legs for robust, efficient hybrid locomotion on wheeled-legged robots, with strong generalization across varied and unseen terrains.

Abstract: Hybrid locomotion of wheeled-legged robots has recently attracted increasing
attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

*Shahid Ansari,Vivek Gupta,Bishakh Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid six-finger gripper with a rigid outer frame and a soft auxetic lattice enables gentle, secure tomato harvesting. The study systematically examines how auxetic lattice orientation (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°) affects grasp conformity, forces, and energy use, showing orientation-tailored geometries can optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce post-harvest damage and labor in fruit handling by enabling gentle, efficient, selective harvesting through soft-ringer robotics. Tailoring auxetic geometries could enhance grasp reliability in unstructured agricultural environments.

Method: A six-finger, rigid-soft hybrid gripper with a soft auxetic internal lattice is developed. Four lattice orientations (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°) are evaluated. Experiments measure grasping forces, deformations, and motor torque; validations use 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) to connect geometry with performance.

Result: Lattice orientation markedly influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency. Different orientations offer distinct advantages, demonstrating that auxetic geometry can be tuned to optimize grasp performance and reduce crop damage in unstructured settings.

Conclusion: The work introduces a novel approach to soft-rigid hybrid gripper design by tailoring auxetic lattice orientation to optimize tomato-harvesting grasping, advancing automated, gentle handling in precision agriculture.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

### [230] [LOMORO: Long-term Monitoring of Dynamic Targets with Minimum Robotic Fleet under Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10046)
*Mingke Lu,Shuaikang Wang,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LOMORO: an online coordination scheme for collaborative monitoring with resource constraints, combining multi-robot task assignment, resource-aware routing via Martin's algorithm, and online adaptation to target behavior and failures; aims to bound monitoring intervals and maintain robot resources while minimizing fleet size; validated via large-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term monitoring of many dynamic targets is tedious or infeasible for a single robot. Fleets can help, but online coordination is hard due to uncertain target behavior and limited perception, and existing work often ignores resource constraints or uses all robots.

Method: Three-part approach: (I) model multi-robot task assignment under constraints on resources and monitoring intervals; (II) resource-aware task coordination with high-level target assignment and low-level multi-objective routing via Martin's algorithm; (III) online adaptation for unpredictable targets and robot failures. Guarantees include upper-bounded monitoring intervals and lower-bounded robot resource levels, while minimizing the average number of active robots.

Result: Validated through extensive large-scale simulations against several baselines, across different road networks, robot speeds, charging rates, and monitoring intervals.

Conclusion: LOMORO provides an online, resource-aware coordination framework for collaborative target monitoring that bounds QoS metrics and reduces fleet size, with demonstrated robustness in simulation experiments.

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

### [231] [Ionospheric and Plasmaspheric Delay Characterization for Lunar Terrestrial GNSS Receivers with Global Core Plasma Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10059)
*Keidai Iiyama,Grace Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GNSS-based lunar PNT is significantly affected by unmodeled ionospheric/plasmaspheric delays; using GCPM and ray-tracing to quantify first- to third-order delays and bending, with delays up to ~100 m under high solar activity, informing robust lunar GNSS algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify and understand unmodeled plasma-induced delays for terrestrial GNSS signals used in lunar spacecraft positioning and timing, enabling accurate and robust lunar PNT.

Method: Combine the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) with a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent signal paths. Simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays and excess path length due to ray bending for GNSS signals at lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic conditions. Analyze dependence on signal frequency, Kp index, and solar R12 index.

Result: Mean group delays are typically around 1 m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude rays during high solar activity; bending delays are smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude paths. Quantified influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic Kp, and solar R12 on delays.

Conclusion: These results aid in designing robust PNT algorithms that leverage terrestrial GNSS signals for lunar navigation, accounting for plasma-induced delays and their variability with solar/geomagnetic activity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

### [232] [Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086)
*Feifei Liu,Haozhe Wang,Zejun Wei,Qirong Lu,Yiyang Wen,Xiaoyu Tang,Jingyan Jiang,Zhijian He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scenario-aware testing framework for autonomous driving prediction models that extends beyond ADE/FDE to evaluate performance across scene structures, map context, density, and agent proximity, exposing hidden failure modes and promoting robust, certifiable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics ADE/FDE fail to capture the complexity and safety-critical nature of multi-agent driving scenarios. There is a need for evaluation that probes interactions, proximity effects, and scene layout to reveal vulnerabilities and corner cases.

Method: Propose a testing framework that systematically varies scene structures, map context, agent density, and spatial distributions; conducts extensive empirical analyses to quantify how proximity of nearby vs distant agents affects target trajectory prediction; identifies scenario-specific failure cases not revealed by traditional metrics.

Result: The analysis reveals a differential impact of agent proximity on prediction accuracy, uncovers scenario-specific failures absent in ADE/FDE benchmarks, and highlights vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art models; the framework demonstrates how scenario-aware evaluation can expose safety-critical weaknesses.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables rigorous, scenario-aware, safety-driven validation of autonomous-driving prediction models, facilitates identification of failure-prone corner cases, and supports development of robust, certifiable prediction systems.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

*Yanjiang Guo,Lucy Xiaoyang Shi,Jianyu Chen,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a controllable multi-view world model to evaluate and improve instruction-following for generalist robot policies via imagination, enabling long-horizon, multi-view predictions and frame-level action control; improves policy performance and ranking without real-world rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating and improving generalist robot policies on unfamiliar objects/instructions is slow and costly with real-world rollouts; scalable alternatives are needed.

Method: Introduce a controllable multi-view world model with pose-conditioned memory retrieval for long-horizon consistency and frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k trajectories, 564 scenes). Uses imagination to synthesize trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for evaluation and policy fine-tuning.

Result: The model generates spatially and temporally consistent trajectories over 20+ seconds in new scenarios, can accurately rank policy performance without real-world rollouts, and improves policy success by 44.7% when imagined trajectories are used for supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: A scalable approach for evaluating and improving generalist robot policies by leveraging a controllable imagination-based world model that supports multi-view predictions, action-level control, and long-horizon consistency.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

### [234] [CompassNav: Steering From Path Imitation To Decision Understanding In Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10154)
*LinFeng Li,Jian Zhao,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Shifts LVLM navigation from path imitation to decision understanding, introducing CompassNav with a 22k-trajectory Compass-Data-22k and a decision-aware RFT; achieves state-of-the-art goal navigation with a 7B model and real-robot robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation-based training reduces navigation to replicating a single correct route, hindering exploration and generalization. There is a need for agents that understand navigation decisions and can evaluate multiple action options relative to the goal.

Method: Introduce Compass-Data-22k with a Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) subset annotating all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Propose a gap-aware hybrid reward that adapts feedback based on decision certainty. Train using an SFT-then-RFT recipe to develop an internal compass that evaluates the relative quality of moves rather than memorizing routes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on goal navigation benchmarks with a 7B agent, outperforming larger proprietary models, and demonstrates robust real-world navigation on a physical robot.

Conclusion: Reframing navigation from path imitation to decision understanding enables better generalization and robustness, yielding an interpretable internal compass and improved navigation performance.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

*Shaokai Wu,Yanbiao Ji,Qiuchang Li,Zhiyi Zhang,Qichen He,Wenyuan Xie,Guodong Zhang,Bayram Bayramli,Yue Ding,Hongtao Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A post-deployment learning framework (Dejavu) uses an Experience Feedback Network to augment frozen Vision-Language-Action policies with retrieved execution memories, enabling continual learning from experience and improved performance in deployed embodied agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployed embodied agents cannot conveniently acquire new knowledge to adapt to new tasks or environments; there is a need for post-deployment, continual learning without altering frozen base models.

Method: Introduce an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) that retrieves contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on these memories. Train EFN with reinforcement learning using semantic-similarity rewards to align predicted actions with past successful behaviors. EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories during deployment to support ongoing adaptation.

Result: Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates compared with frozen baselines.

Conclusion: EFN enables post-deployment learning by continually refining behavior without changing the base VLA policy weights, demonstrating a promising direction for adaptable embodied agents.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

*Zuhong Liu,Junhao Ge,Minhao Xiong,Jiahao Gu,Bowei Tang,Wei Jing,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-humanoid motion imitation framework, Harmanoid, transfers interacting human motions to two robots using contact-aware retargeting and an interaction-driven controller to achieve coordinated, physically plausible motions, outperforming single-humanoid methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the neglected inter-agent dynamics and contact realism in single-humanoid systems, enabling physically grounded two-humanoid interactions.

Method: Two components: (1) contact-aware motion retargeting aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices to restore inter-body coordination; (2) interaction-driven motion controller using interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and plausible contacts.

Result: Experiments show Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation and surpasses existing single-humanoid frameworks that fail in interactive scenarios.

Conclusion: Modeling inter-agent contacts and interaction-aware dynamics is essential for realistic two-humanoid imitation; Harmanoid demonstrates the viability and benefits of this approach.

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically
plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and
interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between
humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments
demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation,
surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such
scenarios.

*Hyogo Hiruma,Hiroshi Ito,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UF-RNN introduces a Foresight module that internally simulates multiple futures to minimize predicted variance, enabling uncertainty-driven exploration and improved robustness in a door-opening task, even without explicit failure demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often fails under real-world uncertainty due to scarce failure data and unseen states. A mechanism to actively explore uncertain actions can improve robustness.

Method: A recurrent network augmented with a Foresight module that performs internal simulations of multiple future trajectories to refine hidden states and reduce predicted variance. The model leverages self-induced chaotic latent dynamics to stimulate exploration when environment is ambiguous, and is evaluated on door-opening in simulation and on a real robot.

Result: The UF-RNN achieves higher success rates and more robust adaptation to uncertain conditions compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines, demonstrating productive exploratory behavior driven by foresight even without explicit failure examples.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation learning can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle unpredictable real-world conditions, with potential generalization to other manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

*Hyogo Hiruma,Hiroshi Ito,Hiroki Mori,Tetsuya Ogata*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Develops a developmental attention model A^3 RNN that merges top-down predictive signals with bottom-up saliency via bidirectional attention, showing emergent, human-like attention in robotic imitation tasks that evolves from saliency-driven to prediction-driven control and yields coherent, interpretable patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior can emerge through mutual adaptation of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in robotics, connecting cognitive science with the free-energy framework and aiming for self-organizing attention without explicit stability optimization.

Method: Proposes A^3 RNN, a bidirectional attention architecture that integrates predictive top-down signals and saliency-based bottom-up cues. Evaluated in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning; analyzes how attention patterns evolve during training.

Result: Attention behaviors evolve from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven focus. Early BU attention highlights salient regions guiding TD, while later TD stabilizes and reshapes what is perceived as salient. The model shows more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, aligning with self-organization principles of perception and prediction.

Conclusion: Developmental interaction between perception and internal prediction can yield robust, self-organizing attention in robots. The approach aligns with cognitive science and the free-energy framework and suggests that mutual adaptation can produce stable, interpretable attention patterns even without explicit stability optimization.

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient physics simulation and accessible, accurate robot models accelerate learning-based robotics research, especially for omnidirectional mobile manipulators; TIAGo++ Omni lacked a usable Isaac Sim model until now.

Method: Develop two omnidirectional drive models (one physically accurate and one lightweight velocity-based) for TIAGo++ Omni in Isaac Sim; implement a learning-based calibration approach that fits the model to the real robot’s S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory data; provide public integration to enable experimentation.

Result: Introduces calibrated models and a learning-based calibration workflow in Isaac Sim for TIAGo++ Omni; enables researchers to simulate and learn control policies with realistic drive dynamics; integration is publicly available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: A practical contribution that fills a modeling gap in Isaac Sim for TIAGo++ Omni, offering both high-fidelity and lightweight models along with a calibration method to match real-world drive behavior, thereby facilitating learning-based control research in omnidirectional mobile manipulation.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with
the robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.

Method: Introduce separate learnable embeddings per data source as embodiment prompts; build X-VLA using soft-prompted Transformer encoders and flow-matching objectives; scalable with minimal parameters; 0.9B model.

Result: Evaluated on 6 simulations and 3 real robots; X-VLA-0.9B achieves state-of-the-art across benchmarks, excelling in dexterity and rapid adaptation across embodiments, environments, tasks.

Conclusion: Soft-prompt cross-embodiment strategy with a simple Transformer-based VLA architecture enables scalable generalist robotics models with strong cross-domain transfer; demonstrates effective use of heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and CrossQ overlay enables safe, precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile robots (DASMRs) without handcrafted trajectories; in simulation, it reaches up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DASMRs have strong kinematic constraints that make classical planners brittle in cluttered environments; a learning-based control approach is needed to achieve safety, precision, and robustness without requiring handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

Method: Apply Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as the core RL algorithm, enhanced with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to improve sample efficiency in sparse-reward tasks, and a CrossQ overlay to promote maneuvering efficiency and obstacle avoidance. The framework operates on DASMR dynamics in simulation, without reliance on handcrafted trajectories or expert demonstrations.

Result: In simulation with a heavy four-wheel-steering rover, the learned policy robustly reaches up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles, demonstrating effective safe and precise navigation under DASMR constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed SAC-based framework with HER and CrossQ overlay provides a viable data-driven solution for safe, precise navigation of nonholonomic and underactuated DASMRs, reducing dependence on handcrafted trajectories or demonstrations. Future work could explore real-world transfer, robustness across varied environments, and extensions to multi-robot settings.

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemistry workflows are time-intensive and manual; integrating robotics and AI aims to expand exploration of chemical space, improve reproducibility and safety, and accelerate innovation in pharma, materials science, and sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Proposes a framework of technologies (mobile manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation) and data-driven protocols that enable autonomous or semi-autonomous experiment execution; emphasizes a collaborative human-robot paradigm and outlines applications, opportunities, and challenges.

Result: A conceptual vision and architectural blueprint rather than a single experimental outcome; highlights potential benefits, integration pathways, and identified challenges for robochemistry.

Conclusion: The future of chemistry lies in a symbiotic partnership where human expertise is amplified by robotic precision and AI-driven insights, accompanied by responsible development and societal considerations.

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and

*Yuxiang Peng,Chuchu Chen,Kejian Wu,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes sqrtVINS, a square-root covariance-based VINS with an LLT-based SRF update and a fast dynamic initialization, achieving ~2x speed over SOTA on 32-bit floats with robust performance in extreme conditions and small time windows; open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedded VINS face numerical instability and resource constraints; canonical SRFs struggle with triangle-structure disruptions during updates, hindering efficiency on low-precision hardware, especially in very short initialization windows.

Method: Introduce an LLT-based SRF update that preserves covariance structure for efficiency and stability; design a dynamic initialization that first recovers minimal states without 3D feature triangulation, then iteratively refines full states via SRF updates; provide open-source implementation and validate on 32-bit hardware (e.g., Jetson Nano).

Result: Demonstrates superior numerical stability and ~2x speed vs SOTA on 32-bit floats; high initialization success within 100 ms under minimal conditions; robust across diverse scenarios; open-source release.

Conclusion: sqrtVINS offers an efficient, robust VINS suitable for embedded platforms, with an open-source release to spur further research and practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

### [244] [Learning to Throw-Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10357)
*Yang Liu,Bruno Da Costa,Aude Billard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot learns to throw-flip objects to a target landing pose by decoupling parasitic rotation through impulse-momentum throwing and combining a physics-based flight model with regression learning. It achieves pose control with data-efficient learning, reuses in-hand spinning knowledge, and demonstrates notable sample-efficiency gains in realRobot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic manipulation for logistics is advancing, but current work focuses on landing position only. Revolute robots suffer parasitic rotation that limits feasible landing poses; enabling controlled orientation at landing expands practical use. The goal is accurate pose control (position + orientation) after throw.

Method: (1) Design a family of throwing motions grounded in impulse-momentum to decouple parasitic rotation and enlarge the feasible landing pose set. (2) Use a physics-based free-flight model combined with regression-based learning to capture unmodeled effects. (3) Employ data assimilation to improve sample efficiency. (4) Leverage prior knowledge of in-hand object spinning to accelerate adaptation to new objects or CoM changes.

Result: Real-robot experiments show throw-flipping to a target pose within ±5 cm and ±45 degrees in dozens of trials. Data assimilation reduces sample complexity by about 40% for unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning. Prior spinning knowledge speeds learning by about 70% when the CoM is shifted. A supplementary video demonstrates the method.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate throw-flip landing poses with data-efficient learning, by decoupling parasitic rotation and fusing physics-based flight with learning, and it benefits from reusing prior spinning knowledge for faster generalization.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

Abstract: Coordinating heterogeneous robot fleets to achieve multiple goals is
challenging in multi-robot systems. We introduce an open-source and extensible
framework for centralized multi-robot task planning and scheduling that
leverages LLMs to enable fleets of heterogeneous robots to accomplish multiple

two-way communication for task execution and replanning. By modularizing each
layer of the autonomy stack and using LLMs for open-world reasoning, RobotFleet
lowers the barrier to building scalable multi-robot systems. The code can be

### [247] [Hierarchical Planning for Long-Horizon Multi-Target Tracking Under Target Motion Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10421)
*Junbin Yuan,Brady Moon,Muqing Cao,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical aerial-planner for persistent multi-target tracking in large-scale environments, using motion-aware uncertainty propagation, sub-task decomposition (search/detect), a low-level coverage planner, success-probability estimation, and an MDP solved with a tree-based method to sequence tasks, achieving substantial reductions in final uncertainty in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent tracking of multiple moving targets with a single robot in large environments is challenging due to accumulating uncertainty when targets leave the field of view, constrained sensing, and the risk of permanent target loss. Existing planners with short horizons underperform in big spaces.

Method: Decompose tracking into single-target search and detection tasks. Introduce a low-level coverage planner that searches within an evolving belief region. Develop an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for each sub-task. Cast the active-tracking problem as a Markov decision process and solve it with a tree-based algorithm to determine the sequence of sub-tasks. Integrate motion models and uncertainty propagation during execution to handle non-static targets.

Result: Simulation experiments show the proposed planner outperforms existing active-trarget tracking planners, achieving an 11–70% reduction in final uncertainty across different environments.

Conclusion: A hierarchical planning framework with motion-aware uncertainty propagation and MD P-based task sequencing improves persistent multi-target tracking in large-scale scenarios, enabling more reliable long-horizon targets tracking; the approach is validated in simulation and may generalize to other platforms and settings.

Abstract: Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large
spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with
constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different
targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

*Jiayu Ding,Xulin Chen,Garrett E. Katz,Zhenyu Gan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A symmetry-guided reinforcement learning framework enables versatile quadrupedal gaits without predefined trajectories, demonstrated on Unitree Go2 across simulation and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of footfall sequences and leg constraints is labor-intensive. A unified approach grounded in the intrinsic symmetries and natural dynamics of quadrupedal locomotion can enable rapid adaptation among diverse gaits.

Method: Introduce a symmetry-guided reward design that encodes temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries, focusing on preserved symmetries and velocity-period dynamics. The framework eliminates the need for predefined trajectories and enables smooth transitions among trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping, trained via reinforcement learning on the Unitree Go2. 

Result: The approach yields robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulation and hardware, with significantly improved gait adaptability and without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control.

Conclusion: Symmetry considerations play a crucial role in dynamic gait design, offering a unified pathway for generating diverse, stable quadrupedal locomotion and reducing manual tuning while broadening achievable gaits.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

### [249] [Galilean Symmetry in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10468)
*Robert Mahony,Jonathan Kelly,Stephan Weiss*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robotics-focused treatment of Galilean symmetry using the Galilean matrix Lie group, introducing two pose representations (Galilean frames with inertial velocity and extended poses with coordinate velocity), with three applications (inertial navigation above rotating Earth, manipulator kinematics, sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty) and a call for robotics adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between Newtonian Galilean symmetry and robotics practice. Leverage familiar rigid-body transformations and pose representations to provide a robotics-tailored exposition, rather than the physics approach that emphasizes relativity.

Method: Define and use the Galilean matrix Lie group to describe two pose representations (Galilean frames and extended poses). Apply Galilean-Lie algebra to robotics problems and illustrate with three examples (inertial navigation, manipulator kinematics, sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty).

Result: Provides clear conceptual insights by recasting problems in terms of Galilean symmetry; demonstrates how Galilean-Lie algebra clarifies inertial motion, velocity representations, and temporal uncertainty in three robotics settings.

Conclusion: The robotics community should rediscover and extend Galilean symmetry material, applying it to modern robotics problems for deeper insights and potentially simpler formulations.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

### [250] [SuperEx: Enhancing Indoor Mapping and Exploration using Non-Line-of-Sight Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10506)
*Kush Garg,Akshat Dave*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient-NLOS-enabled exploration and mapping using single-photon LiDAR to look around corners, improving map accuracy and exploration efficiency in unknown indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Line-of-sight limitations hinder exploration and mapping in unknown interiors; need to utilize hidden information captured by NLOS sensing to accelerate mapping and reduce traversal.

Method: Present SuperEx framework integrating NLOS cues into the mapping-exploration loop: (i) carve empty NLOS regions from timing histograms; (ii) reconstruct occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach exploiting structural regularities.

Result: Achieves ~12% improvement in mapping accuracy at less than 30% coverage; improved exploration efficiency over LOS baselines; validated on complex simulated maps and the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset.

Conclusion: NLOS-aided exploration is viable and enhances mapping beyond direct visibility, enabling more reliable exploration in unknown interiors.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

TL;DR: Proposes a framework that fuses population-coded Spiking Neural Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning to achieve energy-efficient, high-dimensional robotic control. Introduces a Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN) and validates on Isaac Gym/PixMC with a Franka arm, reporting up to 96% energy savings with comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the energy and computation bottlenecks of DRL in resource-constrained robotics, especially for high-dimensional continuous control, by leveraging the efficiency of event-driven SNNs without sacrificing control quality.

Method: Develops PopSAN, a population-coded SNN-based actor that encodes high-dimensional observations into neuronal population activities and trains with gradient-based DRL updates. Evaluated on Isaac Gym with PixMC benchmark, using a Franka arm to demonstrate policy learning and control performance under energy-efficient constraints.

Result: Demonstrates energy savings up to 96.1% compared to traditional ANNs while achieving comparable control performance. Policies show robust finger position tracking and stable height maintenance during pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: Population-coded SNNs offer a viable path to energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in resource-constrained settings and enable scalable deployment of DRL-enabled policies in real-world robotics.

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

TL;DR: A four-channel Cartesian bilateral control method decouples each Cartesian dimension to achieve independent dynamics, enabling intuitive teleoperation across manipulators with different structures and remaining robust to scaling factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve remote manipulation in contact-rich tasks by providing force feedback with tunable dynamics, addressing cross-axis coupling and scaling sensitivity that hinder intuitive control when using diverse manipulators.

Method: Introduce a four-channel bilateral control framework applied in the Cartesian coordinate system that decouples dynamics along each dimension, enabling independent tuning of axis-wise behavior regardless of the overall scaling factor; maintains synchronization of positions and forces between master and slave arms.

Result: The proposed approach achieves the desired dynamics by per-dimension decoupling in Cartesian space, independent of scaling, suggesting improved operability and compatibility across different robotic structures.

Conclusion: Decoupling Cartesian dimensions in a four-channel bilateral control framework enables intuitive, scalable remote manipulation across heterogeneous manipulators, with dynamics that can be tuned independently for each axis.

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate
system regardless of the scaling factor.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An RL-driven high-level selector dynamically tunes the cost-function weights of a low-level trajectory planner, achieving adaptive, safer, and faster autonomous racing with no collisions in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static, manually-tuned cost weights in sampling-based trajectory planners force a safety-competitiveness trade-off across diverse racing scenarios; a dynamic approach could improve performance and safety.

Method: Train/use a reinforcement learning agent to switch between cost-function parameters of an analytical trajectory planner at runtime, enabling behavior (aggressive/conservative) depending on context.

Result: Simulations show 0% collision rate; up to 60% faster overtaking compared with state-of-the-art static planners; enables interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations.

Conclusion: High-level RL selector resolves safety-competitiveness trade-off and offers adaptive, interpretable motion planning applicable to broader autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning
for broader autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Improving robotic navigation is critical for extending exploration range and
enhancing operational efficiency. Vision-based navigation relying on
traditional CCD or CMOS cameras faces major challenges when complex

accessibility of mobile planetary robots. In this study, we propose a novel
approach to planetary navigation that leverages the unique imaging capabilities
of Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) cameras. We present the first

sensing technology for robotic exploration missions targeting perceptually
challenging locations, with a special emphasis on high-latitude lunar regions.
We detail the operating principles and performance characteristics of SPAD

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A neuro-inspired 6-DoF grasp detector, SpikeGrasp, uses asynchronous stereo spike cameras and a recurrent spiking neural network to infer grasps directly from raw event streams without reconstructing 3D point clouds, achieving high data efficiency and superior performance in cluttered/textureless scenes, especially for dynamic objects, validated on a synthetic benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional robotic grasping relies on expensive 3D point clouds and heavy computation, whereas a brain-inspired, end-to-end approach could enable faster, more data-efficient grasping by processing raw sensory streams (events) directly.

Method: Process raw asynchronous stereo spike camera events from left/right views, fuse them, and feed into a recurrent spiking neural network that iteratively refines grasp hypotheses without point-cloud reconstruction, evaluated on a large synthetic benchmark and compared to point-cloud baselines.

Result: SpikeGrasp outperforms traditional point-cloud-based grasping baselines, with especially strong performance in cluttered and textureless scenes and notable data efficiency, indicating robustness to challenging environments and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: End-to-end neuro-inspired grasping is viable, offering fluid and efficient manipulation akin to natural systems and laying groundwork for future systems capable of real-time, robust grasping without explicit 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

TL;DR: RoboSimGS delivers a Real2Sim2Real pipeline that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity simulation environments for robotic manipulation, using 3D Gaussian Splatting for visuals and mesh-based physics, with an MLLM to automate asset creation; achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and enhances SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data collection for robotic learning is costly, and sim-to-real gaps in appearance, physics, and object interactions limit scalability. A scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive synthetic pipeline is needed to bridge this gap.

Method: Reconstruct scenes via 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealistic appearance; represent interactive objects with mesh primitives to ensure accurate physics; employ a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to infer physical properties (density, stiffness) and kinematic structures (hinges, rails) from visuals, enabling automated articulated asset creation; train policies entirely in the RoboSimGS environment and demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across tasks.

Result: Zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks when policies are trained in RoboSimGS; RoboSimGS-generated data also improves performance and generalization of state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RoboSimGS is a powerful, scalable solution that effectively bridges the sim-to-real gap by automating high-fidelity, physically interactive synthetic data generation and supporting transfer to real robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

TL;DR: UniCoD pretrains on 1M instructional videos to learn dynamic visual representations and fine-tunes on robot data to map predictive features to actions, achieving ~9% and ~12% gains in simulation and real-world OOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic generalist policies require both semantic understanding and visual dynamics modeling; prior work relies on either vision-language models or generative models. A unified model that integrates understanding, planning, and future representation learning can better support embodied agents.

Method: Pretrain UniCoD on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos to acquire dynamic, predictive visual features; fine-tune on robot-embodiment data to map predictive representations to action tokens, leveraging unified generation-and-understanding capabilities for planning and prediction.

Result: Consistent improvements over baselines: 9% gains in simulation environments and 12% gains on real-world out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating generation and understanding through large-scale pretraining yields stronger generalization and performance for robotic policies, supporting the value of unified perception–planning–prediction representations in embodied robots.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world

### [258] [Deployment and Development of a Cognitive Teleoreactive Framework for Deep Sea Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10716)
*Christopher Thierauf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DINOS-R is a Python-based mission planning/execution framework for an AUV (Sentry) that unifies symbolic decision making with machine learning and reactive behaviors, aiming for understandable, provable behavior and field-readiness across oceanographic platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to replace legacy MC architectures with a system that blends symbolic planning (for interpretability and provability) and data-driven/ reactive components, enabling non-expert use and extensibility across oceanographic platforms.

Method: developed from the ground up (Python3), modular and extensible architecture. supports declarative mission specification and flexible behavior specification, enabling simultaneous real-time task planning and hard-coded user plans. Demonstrated on the AUV Sentry and in simulations, with emphasis on non-expert usability.

Result: Field tests on Sentry and a variety of simulated cases demonstrated the capabilities and practicality of DINOS-R, including integration of planning, control, and learning components; results discussed with plans for future work.

Conclusion: DINOS-R shows promise as a unified, extensible mission planning/execution framework combining symbolic decision making with machine learning and reactive behaviors, suitable for field deployment and future oceanographic research; future work outlined.

Abstract: A new AUV mission planning and execution software has been tested on AUV
Sentry. Dubbed DINOS-R, it draws inspiration from cognitive architectures and
AUV control systems to replace the legacy MC architecture. Unlike these
existing architectures, however, DINOS-R is built from the ground-up to unify
symbolic decision making (for understandable, repeatable, provable behavior)
with machine learning techniques and reactive behaviors, for field-readiness
across oceanographic platforms. Implemented primarily in Python3, DINOS-R is
extensible, modular, and reusable, with an emphasis on non-expert use as well
as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

### [259] [Controllable Generative Trajectory Prediction via Weak Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10731)
*Yongxi Cao,Julian F. Schumann,Jens Kober,Joni Pajarinen,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PrefCVAE uses weakly labeled preferences to inject semantic attributes into the CVAE latent space, enabling controllable diversity in trajectory predictions without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diversity and controllability are crucial for safe autonomous planning; existing trajectory predictors emphasize accuracy but lack controllable, semantically meaningful diversity.

Method: Propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE trained with weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes (e.g., average velocity). Preference supervision guides sampling to produce controllable, semantically meaningful trajectories without degrading baseline accuracy.

Result: PrefCVAE achieves controllable, semantically meaningful trajectory predictions while maintaining baseline accuracy; preference supervision is an effective, cost-efficient way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

Conclusion: Preference supervision via weak labels is a practical approach to inject semantic control into generative trajectory models, improving controllable diversity without harming accuracy.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

### [260] [Gain Tuning Is Not What You Need: Reward Gain Adaptation for Constrained Locomotion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10759)
*Arthicha Srisuchinnawong,Poramate Manoonpong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROGER adaptively tunes reward-weighting gains online to satisfy constraints during robot locomotion learning, improving safety and performance compared to fixed-weight baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline reward-weight tuning struggles to guarantee constraint satisfaction during continuous, embodied learning; online regulation of gains based on penalties can unify safety with performance, enabling real-world deployment.

Method: ROGER automatically adjusts the ratio between positive (primary) and negative (penalty) reward gains based on penalties observed during learning. The ratio decreases as constraint thresholds approach to avoid violations and increases in safe states to boost performance, demonstrated on a 60-kg quadruped, MuJoCo benchmarks (including a single-leg hopper), and real-world robot learning from scratch in about an hour.

Result: ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violations across multiple trials; up to 50% more primary reward than state-of-the-art methods; in MuJoCo locomotion tasks, comparable or up to 100% higher performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation; real-world quadruped learning from scratch completed within one hour without any falls.

Conclusion: Online reward-weight adaptation via embodied regulation enables constraint-satisfying real-world continual locomotion learning and reduces the need for manual reward-tuning, aiding the development of physical robots.

Abstract: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline
selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint
satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

### [261] [Real2USD: Scene Representations in Universal Scene Description Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10778)
*Christopher D. Hsu,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A general Universal Scene Description (USD) based representation for LLM-assisted robotics, enabling robust perception, reasoning, and planning; demonstrates a Real to USD pipeline on a quadruped robot and in simulated environments; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need flexible, general priors for robotic task planning; existing approaches are often task-specific. USD provides a human- and LLM-readable scene graph that encodes geometric, photometric, and semantic information, offering a universal representation for diverse robotics tasks.

Method: Develop a Real2USD pipeline: a Unitree Go2 robot with LiDAR and RGB camera builds explicit USD scene graphs of indoor environments with diverse objects and glass; parse USD with Google Gemini to perform scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. Evaluate in simulated warehouse and hospital settings using Nvidia's Isaac Sim.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of real-to-USD mapping enabling LLM-based reasoning and planning. The approach supports scene understanding and inference through USD parsing, with experiments in real and simulated environments. Code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: USD is a viable universal representation for robotics tasks, enabling generalizable LLM-based reasoning and planning. The Real2USD pipeline offers a practical approach to unify perception and decision-making across diverse environments; code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

### [262] [Two-Layer Voronoi Coverage Control for Hybrid Aerial-Ground Robot Teams in Emergency Response: Implementation and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10781)
*Douglas Hutchings,Luai Abuelsamen,Karthik Rajgopal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-layer Voronoi-based coordination framework for hybrid aerial-ground robots in hazardous emergency response, decoupling aerial and ground optimization and enabling rapid sensor deployment via airdrops. Demonstrates an 88% faster response, achieving target sensor coverage in 25 s versus 220 s for ground-only deployment; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency responders face heterogeneous agent capabilities (different speeds), clustered initial deployments, and urgent time constraints. Traditional Voronoi coverage methods struggle with these factors, risking slow response and poor initial coverage in hazardous environments.

Method: Proposes a decoupled two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot positioning. Aerial agents can deliver ground sensors via airdrop to high-priority locations. Implements bounded Voronoi cell computation, efficient numerical integration for importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies to prevent agent trapping.

Result: Simulation results show an 88% reduction in response time. The method achieves target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds, compared to 220 seconds for a ground-only deployment.

Conclusion: The two-layer approach mitigates key limitations of traditional Voronoi coverage methods in hazardous emergency scenarios, enabling rapid and robust sensor deployment. The implementation details are provided, and complete code is available for replication.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency
response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three
critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation

### [263] [Representing Data in Robotic Tactile Perception -- A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10804)
*Alessandro Albini,Mohsen Kaboli,Giorgio Cannata,Perla Maiolino*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A survey of tactile data representation identifies six common data structures and provides guidelines for selecting representations based on hardware, encoded tactile information, and task needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-level tactile perception often repurposes techniques from computer vision, which require structured input. Misalignment between representation and hardware/task can degrade information encoding and task performance; a systematic study of representations is needed.

Method: Comprehensive literature review of tactile perception studies; categorization and analysis of data representations; examination of relationships among hardware, representations, and high-level computation; identification of six widely used structures; formulation of practical guidelines.

Result: Six common data representations in tactile perception were identified; the study analyzes how representation choices impact information encoding and task performance; provides guidelines for selecting representation according to hardware constraints, tactile information to be encoded, and task requirements.

Conclusion: Choosing an appropriate data representation is crucial for effective tactile perception; the paper offers a taxonomy and guidelines to better align hardware, data encoding, and high-level processing, facilitating transfer and standardization in the field.

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

### [264] [Contact Sensing via Joint Torque Sensors and a Force/Torque Sensor for Legged Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10843)
*Jared Grinberg,Yanran Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Generalized momentum-based observer using distributed joint torque sensors plus a hip force–torque sensor enables accurate contact localization and force estimation on robot legs, demonstrated in simulation and hardware with sub-centimeter localization and low force error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate contact sensing on robot limbs is critical for interaction and safety; existing methods rely on friction models or indirect estimates; there is a need for low-cost, direct torque sensing that improves accuracy.

Method: Developed low-cost strain-gauge joint torque sensors at every joint and integrated them with a hip-mounted force–torque sensor. Used a generalized momentum-based observer. Validation included simulation on a floating 2-DoF leg and hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, with a calibration procedure for the torque sensors.

Result: Torque sensors achieved an average calibration accuracy of 96.4% relative to ground truth. Simulations demonstrated accurate recovery of contact force and location along the thigh and shin. Hardware experiments yielded sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate contact detection and localization with distributed torque sensing and minimal reliance on friction models, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for legged robots and manipulators to improve interaction control.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

### [265] [Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective RL for Integrated Command Tracking and Force Compliance in Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10851)
*Tingxuan Leng,Yushi Wang,Tinglong Zheng,Changsheng Luo,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A preference-conditioned multi-objective RL framework for humanoid locomotion balancing command tracking and external-force compliance within a single omnidirectional policy, using velocity-resistance rewards and an encoder-decoder for privileged feature inference; validated in simulation and on a real robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid locomotion requires both accurate navigation command tracking and compliant interaction with external forces; existing RL often emphasizes robustness at the expense of compliance, which is challenging for unstable humanoids.

Method: Formulates locomotion as a multi-objective RL problem with user-driven preferences, introducing a preference-conditioned MORL framework that merges rigid command following and compliant behaviors in one policy. External forces are captured via a velocity-resistance reward factor; an encoder-decoder infers task-relevant privileged features from deployable observations, enabling a single omnidirectional policy.

Result: Experimental validation in simulation and real-world experiments shows improved adaptability and convergence over standard pipelines and demonstrates deployable preference-conditioned humanoid locomotion.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates rigid command-following and compliant behaviors within a single policy, improving adaptability and deployability of humanoid locomotion when preferences guide the trade-off between competing objectives.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

### [266] [GRIP: A Unified Framework for Grid-Based Relay and Co-Occurrence-Aware Planning in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10865)
*Ahmed Alanazi,Duy Ho,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRIP is a modular grid-based navigation framework with three variants (L, F, R) that integrates perception, symbolic planning, and learning-based control to improve long-horizon navigation in dynamic, partially observable environments; it shows improved success rates and path efficiency in AI2-THOR/RoboTHOR and real-world Jetbot deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on static priors and limited memory in existing methods, enabling generalization across diverse layouts and semantic object categories under perceptual uncertainty.

Method: Dynamic 2D grid construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic planning, and hybrid policy execution (behavioral cloning, D* search, and grid-conditioned control); three variants GRIP-L (semantic occupancy grids), GRIP-F (multi-hop anchor chaining and LLM introspection), GRIP-R (real-world deployment).

Result: Up to 9.6% higher success rates and over 2x improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on AI2-THOR/RoboTHOR long-horizon tasks; qualitative analysis shows interpretable symbolic plans; real-world Jetbot deployment verifies robustness under sensor noise and environmental variation.

Conclusion: GRIP provides a robust, scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world navigation, adaptable to heterogeneous environments and tasks.

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

### [267] [QuayPoints: A Reasoning Framework to Bridge the Information Gap Between Global and Local Planning in Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10886)
*Yashom Dighe,Youngjin Kim,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework called QuayPoints preserves and communicates global time-optimality insights to a local planner in autonomous racing, improving decision-making and enabling overtakes at up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four tracks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In standard autonomy pipelines, high-level optimality knowledge is lost as information propagates downstream, causing local planners to act with limited global context. Time-optimality information could improve strategic decisions such as overtaking.

Method: Introduce QuayPoints regions that mark where deviations from the optimal raceline materially degrade global optimality. Integrate this information into an existing planner to convey global knowledge to the local planner, enabling better decisions when deviating from the raceline. Validate by demonstrating overtakes on four race tracks where opponents travel up to 75% of ego speed.

Result: QuayPoints enable the local planner to make more informed global decisions, yielding consistent overtakes at speeds up to 75% of the ego vehicle on four tracks.

Conclusion: Preserving and passing key global insights (time-optimality) through QuayPoints improves downstream local planning, supporting better strategic decisions like overtaking in autonomous racing.

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

### [268] [An Adaptive Transition Framework for Game-Theoretic Based Takeover](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10893)
*Dikshant Shehmar,Matthew E. Taylor,Ehsan Hashemi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive shared-control handover using a cooperative differential game to adjust authority by time and driver tracking; improves stability and reduces driver effort vs fixed transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOTL situations in automated driving degrade driver readiness and reaction times; fixed time-based takeover strategies fail to capture real-time variations in driver performance.

Method: Model takeover as a cooperative differential game with time-varying objective functions that modulate authority; introduce a driver-specific state-tracking matrix to personalize the transition; evaluate via cumulative trajectory error; test in human-in-the-loop ISO lane-change maneuvers.

Result: Adaptive transitions lower trajectory deviations and reduce driver control effort; real-time authority adjustment enhances vehicle stability during takeover.

Conclusion: Dynamic, driver-aware adjustment of control authority yields more natural, stable handovers and supports personalized shared control in automated driving; promising for real-world adoption with further personalization and validation.

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

TL;DR: A broad survey of robotic manipulation that extends planning and control taxonomies, introduces a unified framework, identifies bottlenecks, and provides curated resources and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify perception, planning, and control in robotic manipulation by expanding high-level planning to include language, code, motion, affordances, and 3D representations, while formalizing low-level learning-based control and identifying bottlenecks to improve data use and generalization.

Method: A comprehensive literature survey that proposes new taxonomies for high-level planning and low-level control, introduces a dedicated bottleneck taxonomy, analyzes real-world applications, and curates a repository of papers, datasets, and projects.

Conclusion: The survey offers a wider and deeper perspective than prior reviews, serving as a practical roadmap for newcomers and a structured reference for researchers to advance embodied manipulation.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we
provide the first dedicated taxonomy of key bottlenecks, focusing on data
collection, utilization, and generalization, and conclude with an extensive
review of real-world applications. Compared with prior surveys, our work offers
both a broader scope and deeper insight, serving as an accessible roadmap for

TL;DR: RoboMAP uses continuous adaptive affordance heatmaps to ground spatial targets, delivering robust, interpretable grounding and strong performance in language-guided manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete points used for spatial grounding are brittle under perceptual noise and semantic ambiguity; a dense, uncertainty-aware representation can improve policy robustness and interpretability.

Method: Represent spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps and integrate this dense grounding into downstream policies; validate across simulated and real-world tasks, with emphasis on robustness and interpretability.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on the majority of grounding benchmarks with up to 50x faster inference; achieves 82% success rate in real-world manipulation; demonstrates robust performance across extensive simulated and physical experiments; shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation.

Conclusion: Dense, continuous affordance heatmaps for spatial grounding improve task success, interpretability, robustness, and cross-domain generalization in language-guided robotics.

Abstract: Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning
into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic
ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More

### [271] [Game-Theoretic Risk-Shaped Reinforcement Learning for Safe Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10960)
*Dong Hu,Fenqing Hu,Lidong Yang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A game-theoretic risk-shaped RL framework (GTR2L) for safe autonomous driving that models interactions and risks with adaptive rollout and uncertainty-aware safety boundaries, achieving superior safety and efficiency over baselines including humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in RL for autonomous driving, risk and safety constraints are often implicit; real-world traffic requires explicit handling of stochastic interactions and hazards under uncertainty.

Method: Introduce GTR2L: a multi-level game-theoretic world model predicting interactive behaviors and associated risks; adaptive rollout horizon based on predictive uncertainty; uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism to flexibly modulate safety boundaries; explicit risk modeling capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse, safety-critical traffic scenarios show GTR2L outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in success rate, collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: GTR2L advances safe autonomous driving by integrating risk-aware game-theoretic planning with explicit uncertainty modeling, enabling more reliable and efficient decision-making in complex environments.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

### [272] [RoVer: Robot Reward Model as Test-Time Verifier for Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10975)
*Mingtong Dai,Lingbo Liu,Yongjie Bai,Yang Liu,Zhouxia Wang,Rui SU,Chunjie Chen,Liang Lin,Xinyu Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoVer enables test-time scaling for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by using a Robot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a test-time verifier to generate and score multiple action candidates, guided by learned directions and cached perception, improving decision quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data- and compute-intensive nature of scaling VLA models for robotics. The goal is to achieve better performance at test time without modifying architectures or weights, thereby reducing data collection costs and training overhead.

Method: RoVer is a plug-and-play framework. It uses a Robot PRM that provides scalar process rewards and action-space directions to guide exploration. During inference, multiple candidate actions are generated, expanded along PRM-predicted directions, and scored by PRM to select the best action. Perception features are cached to amortize cost, enabling scalable candidate generation under a fixed compute budget.

Result: RoVer converts available compute into better action decision-making by enabling more candidates and guided exploration at test time, achieving scalable evaluation without additional training. It offers (1) a general VLA test-time scaling framework, (2) a PRM that provides rewards and guidance, and (3) an efficient direction-guided sampling strategy with perception caching to support scalable inference.

Conclusion: RoVer provides a practical, plug-and-play solution for improving VLA model performance at test time without retraining, leveraging PRMs and shared perception caches to enable scalable candidate evaluation and improved action selection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

*Qizhi Guo,Siyuan Yang,Junning Lyu,Jianjun Sun,Defu Lin,Shaoming He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive EKF-based MARG-only heading estimator (AMO-HEAD) for UAVs in magnetically disturbed indoor environments. Uses gyro to propagate quaternion, accelerometer and magnetometer to correct, with adaptive noise tuning and magnetic disturbance scaling; Lie-derivative observability analysis; validated in real indoor experiments showing robust heading accuracy with low computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor UAV navigation suffers from severe magnetic disturbances that degrade heading accuracy. A lightweight, adaptive, MARG-only solution is needed to maintain reliable heading for inspections.

Method: Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD): an EKF framework propagating quaternion with gyroscope, correcting with accelerometer and magnetometer data. Includes adaptive process noise covariance to model gyroscope noise, bias drift, and discretization errors; applies a real-time magnetic deviation-based scaling to mitigate disturbances; includes Lie-derivative observability analysis.

Result: Extensive real-world indoor experiments with customized UAV platforms demonstrate the approach achieves robust and precise heading estimation under magnetically disturbed conditions.

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD offers a robust, lightweight heading estimation solution for magnetically disturbed indoor UAV operations, suitable for indoor inspection tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

TL;DR: Zero-shot, sampling-based priors from large pretrained generative models enable recovery of complete 3D scenes (occupancy + target semantics) from partial observations for planning under partial observability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Priors are essential for planning under partial observability but are hard to obtain in practice; need priors that capture environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships without task-specific data collection.

Method: A sampling-based pipeline conditioned on partial observations uses large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors, reconstructing complete RGB-D point clouds with occupancy and target semantics for configuration-space planning. Evaluated on a Matterport3D-based benchmark with rooms visible through doorways to test occupancy and target-location uncertainty.

Result: The approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds suitable for motion planning, demonstrating that generative models can serve as rich, zero-shot priors for robotic planning.

Conclusion: Generative models offer a promising, zero-shot source of priors for planning under partial observability, capable of modeling occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions and improving configuration-space planning.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Refinery boosts robustness of policies in simulation-based robotic assembly by coordinating Bayesian Optimization-guided fine-tuning of individual policies with Gaussian Mixture Model-based initial-condition sampling at deployment, yielding a ~11 percentage-point improvement to 91.51% in simulation and enabling reliable chaining of up to 8 parts without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy performance in simulation-based learning for contact-rich tasks is highly variable across initial conditions, hindering industry-grade reliability and long-horizon task chaining.

Method: 1) Bayesian Optimization-guided fine-tuning of each policy to improve performance under noise and control errors. 2) Gaussian Mixture Model-based sampling of initial conditions during deployment to select favorable initializations that maximize execution success. 3) Demonstration: chaining of fine-tuned policies to accomplish long-horizon assembly without explicit multi-step training.

Result: Mean success rate improved by 10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based robotic assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation. Real-world performance is comparable. The approach enables chaining of policies to assemble up to 8 parts without additional multi-step training.

Conclusion: Refinery effectively bridges the performance gap in simulation-based learning for robotic assembly by robustifying policy performance across initial conditions, enabling longer-horizon tasks and improved reliability suitable for industry standards.

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
requiring explicit multi-step training.

*Yeonseo Lee,Jungwook Mun,Hyosup Shin,Guebin Hwang,Junhee Nam,Taeyeop Lee,Sungho Jo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: XGrasp is a real-time, gripper-aware grasp detection framework that supports multiple gripper configurations through a hierarchical two-stage design, dataset augmentation, and contrastive learning for zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers, achieving faster inference and competitive grasp success across grippers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field often optimizes grasping for a single gripper type, limiting applicability in real-world tasks requiring diverse end-effectors. Data scarcity for multi-gripper scenarios further hinders progress. A real-time, gripper-agnostic approach with fast inference and generalization is needed.

Method: A two-stage architecture: (1) Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) uses global scene context and gripper specifications to propose grasp points; (2) Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in AWP enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers. The approach augments existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations, and integrates with vision foundation models to enable future vision-language capabilities.

Result: Experimental results show competitive grasp success rates across multiple gripper types and substantial improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Conclusion: XGrasp offers a real-time, versatile grasp detection framework capable of handling diverse gripper configurations, with data augmentation to address scarcity, and a contrastive-learning-based path to zero-shot gripper generalization, plus integration potential with vision-language foundations.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

TL;DR: A DRL-based autonomous cooperative planning framework using SAC with GRUs to handle perception, planning, and communication uncertainties in multi-vehicle coordination; demonstrated in CARLA and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address multiple uncertainties (perception, planning, communication) that hinder cooperative motion planning in autonomous vehicle networks, aiming to improve safety and efficiency.

Method: Propose DRLACP using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) augmented with Gate Recurrent Units (GRUs) to learn robust time-varying actions under imperfect state information caused by uncertainties in planning, communication, and perception.

Result: DRLACP successfully learns cooperative planning policies and outperforms baseline methods across scenarios with imperfect AV state information in CARLA simulations.

Conclusion: DRLACP is an effective framework for coping with uncertainty in autonomous cooperative planning, enabling real-time, robust multi-vehicle coordination demonstrated in CARLA; suggests potential for improving ITS safety and performance.

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified physical-world humanoid-scene interaction system (PhysHSI) combines adversarial motion-prior policy learning in simulation with a LiDAR-camera perception module for real-world deployment, enabling lifelike, generalizable behaviors across tasks like box carrying, sitting, lying, and standing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between perception and manipulation for humanoid robots in real-world environments. Prior work often tackled perception and motion separately or lacked real-world robustness and lifelike motion; there is a need for an end-to-end system that can generalize to diverse tasks and environments.

Method: In simulation, use adversarial motion-prior-based policy learning to imitate natural humanoid-scene interactions across varied scenarios, achieving generalization and lifelike motion. For real-world deployment, implement a coarse-to-fine object localization module that fuses LiDAR and camera inputs to provide continuous, robust scene perception. Validate on four tasks (box carrying, sitting, lying, standing up) in both simulation and real world.

Result: PhysHSI achieves consistently high success rates and strong generalization across diverse task goals, with natural, lifelike motion patterns demonstrated in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysHSI system enables autonomous humanoid-scene interactions with lifelike behavior and robust perception, addressing the integration challenge of perception and manipulation for real-world humanoid robotics.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flow Planner introduces fine-grained trajectory tokenization, a fusion-focused architecture, and flow-matched, classifier-free guided multi-modal generation to model interactive driving; it achieves state-of-the-art results on nuPlan and interPlan datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling interactive driving behaviors is hard due to data scarcity and the ineffectiveness of naive transformer stacking for interactions; existing imitation learning struggles with high-value interactive dynamics.

Method: 1) Fine-grained trajectory tokenization with overlapping segments to reduce modeling complexity. 2) Architecture enabling efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information to capture interactions. 3) Flow matching with classifier-free guidance to generate multi-modal behaviors and dynamically reweight agent interactions during inference.

Result: On nuPlan and interPlan datasets, Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches and better models interactive behaviors in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Flow Planner effectively addresses interactive driving modeling by combining data modeling, architecture, and learning scheme; demonstrates strong interactive behavior modeling and planning performance in realistic driving tasks.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

*Junxiang Wang,Han Zhang,Zehao Wang,Huaiyuan Chen,Pu Wang,Weidong Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A soft, knee rehabilitation exoskeleton using origami-inspired pneumatic actuators is controlled by a Deep Koopman Network model of human-robot interaction that incorporates EMG and PWM inputs, with MPC-based control; personalization improves model accuracy and the approach outperforms PID in passive and active training, offering a new framework for soft rehab robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid exoskeletons are heavy and require substantial don/doffing effort and safety-compliance control. Soft exoskeletons offer comfort and intrinsic compliance but pose challenging nonlinear HRI dynamics. A modeling-based control framework is needed to enable real-time, comfortable, and safe rehabilitation with soft robots.

Method: Design a knee rehabilitation soft exoskeleton using origami-inspired pneumatic actuators. Model the human-robot interaction dynamics with a Deep Koopman Network, taking EMG signals and the PWM duty cycle controlling valves/pump as inputs. Use the resulting linear Koopman model within a Model Predictive Control framework to track a reference trajectory in real time. Compare EMG-integrated vs non-EMG models and personalized vs non-personalized models, and contrast the MPC framework against traditional PID in both passive and active training modes.

Result: Incorporating EMG signals into the Koopman model significantly improves model accuracy. A personalized Koopman model trained on an individual’s data performs better than a non-personalized one. The proposed MPC-based control framework outperforms PID in both passive and active training modes.

Conclusion: The study presents a viable, real-time control framework for soft rehabilitation robots, combining origami-inspired pneumatic actuation, EMG-informed Koopman modeling, and MPC to enhance safety, comfort, and rehabilitation effectiveness.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematically compares SO(3) action representations (Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, Lie algebra coordinates, and local-frame tangent vectors) in PPO, SAC, and TD3 across dense and sparse rewards. Finds geometry of action representations strongly shapes exploration and optimization; tangents in the local frame are most reliable across algorithms and benchmarks; provides practical guidelines for choosing rotation actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(3) is nontrivial to parameterize globally. In RL, the choice of rotation representation can introduce constraints and failure modes that affect learning, exploration, and stability. The paper aims to systematically understand these effects and provide actionable guidance.

Method: Empirical study across three continuous-control algorithms (PPO, SAC, TD3) and multiple robotics benchmarks. Compare representations of SO(3) actions (e.g., Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, Lie algebra coordinates) and projection methods to obtain valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Evaluate under dense and sparse reward structures, focusing on exploration, entropy interaction, and training stability.

Result: Action representations induced by geometry significantly affect exploration and optimization. Representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most stable and reliable performance across PPO, SAC, and TD3. The study culminates in practical guidelines for selecting and using rotation actions in RL.

Conclusion: The geometric properties of SO(3) action representations matter in RL. For robustness and cross-algorithm reliability, local-frame tangent-vector representations are preferred, and practitioners should consider projection constraints and reward structure when choosing a rotation action parameterization.

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

TL;DR: DemoHLM enables sim-to-real loco-manipulation for humanoids from a single simulation demonstration using a hierarchical controller and simulation-generated imitation policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loco-manipulation remains challenging due to reliance on hard-coded task definitions or data-heavy real-world collection; there is a need for data-efficient, generalizable approaches that can transfer from simulation to real humanoids.

Method: A hierarchical framework combining a low-level universal whole-body controller that maps motion commands to joint torques with high-level manipulation policies trained in simulation through data generation and imitation learning. The policies use closed-loop visual feedback to command the whole-body controller for diverse loco-manipulation tasks. A sim-to-real pipeline validates transfer on a Unitree G1 robot with RGB-D input.

Result: The approach shows data-efficiency: more synthetic data improves policy performance. Real-world experiments demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness across ten loco-manipulation tasks despite spatial variations.

Conclusion: DemoHLM demonstrates that a single-simulation demonstration, coupled with a data-generation and imitation-learning pipeline and a hierarchical control architecture, can achieve generalizable loco-manipulation on real humanoid robots with solid sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

*Xiaobin Zhou,Miao Wang,Chengao Li,Can Cui,Ruibin Zhang,Yongchao Wang,Chao Xu,Fei Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A rotor-failure-aware navigation system for quadrotors that integrates online failure detection and diagnosis (FDD) with a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), a rotor-failure-aware planner using spatial–temporal optimization, and a LiDAR-equipped platform with anti-torque plates to maintain perception, enabling autonomous flight under rotor failures in unknown environments (shown via cluttered rooms and unknown forests).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotor failures cause rotor imbalance, leading to high-speed rotation and vibration that impede autonomous flight in unknown environments. Traditional fault-tolerant control and predefined trajectories lack online FDD, planning, and control for post-failure operation in complex settings.

Method: 1) A composite FDD-based NMPC that incorporates motor dynamics for fast failure detection and flight stability. 2) A rotor-failure-aware planner that leverages FDD results with spatial-temporal joint optimization. 3) A LiDAR-based quadrotor platform with four anti-torque plates to ensure reliable perception during high-speed rotation.

Result: Benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods show superior performance in handling rotor failures (e.g., propeller unloading, motor stoppage). Experimental results demonstrate autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables rotor-failure-robust autonomous quadrotor navigation in unknown environments by integrating online FDD, planning, and fault-tolerant control, and reports the first demonstration of such capability.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

*Weixi Situ,Hanjing Ye,Jianwei Peng,Yu Zhan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive dense candidate-point sampling in socially aware zones with a multi-objective evaluation to plan a person-following trajectory, integrated with a prediction-aware MPPI controller for proactive collision avoidance; demonstrates improved smoothness, safety, robustness, and comfort in dynamic crowds and real-world mobile-robot tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions from moving obstacles (e.g., pedestrians) degrade robot person-following performance. Current methods rely on fixed reference points or sparse heuristics, which fail in dynamic, crowded environments. A socially aware, predictive planning approach is needed for robust, safe RPF.

Method: Adaptive trajectory sampling generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones. Each candidate is evaluated using a multi-objective cost to select an optimal follow-point. The follower trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. A prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller then tracks this trajectory while proactively avoiding collisions using predicted pedestrian motions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with successful real-world validation on a mobile robot in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables more robust and comfortable robot person-following in dynamic environments by combining dense social-zone candidate sampling, multi-objective evaluation, and a prediction-aware MPPI controller for proactive collision avoidance.

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

*Ruizhe Liu,Pei Zhou,Qian Luo,Li Sun,Jun Cen,Yibing Song,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-supervised, dual-structure framework learns hierarchical, cross-modal manipulation concepts that generalize across environments and tasks, improving policy performance and yielding interpretable primitives without supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation requires representations that capture invariant interaction patterns across diverse environments and tasks. Supervised approaches struggle with generalization and annotation burden; a self-supervised method could extract transferable patterns.

Method: Two-part architecture: (1) a cross-modal correlation network identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities, and (2) a multi-horizon predictor organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales. Together, they learn manipulation concepts without semantic labels, guiding policies to leverage transferable relational patterns while handling short- and long-term goals.

Result: Policy performance improves significantly on both simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments when augmented with the learned concepts. The concepts align with human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite the absence of semantic supervision.

Conclusion: The work advances representation learning for manipulation by delivering a practical, self-supervised approach that yields transferable, interpretable concepts and enhances robotic performance in complex, cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework enabling humanoid robots to perform inspection tasks efficiently with millimeter precision by integrating hierarchical planning (IK/MIP), a novel MIP for standing pose and trajectory length, and an MPC with simplified kinematics for accurate end-effector tracking, validated on Kuavo 4Pro.


<details>

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An AI-driven, low-latency IoT teleoperation framework for smart cities that combines a Flutter UI, MQTT signaling, and WebRTC video with lightweight vision (YOLOv11-nano) and a distributed hardware stack to enable real-time remote manipulation and monitoring across VPNs.

### [288] [A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448)
*Yuankai He,Hanlin Chen,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sensor-in-Memory (SIM) provides a shared-memory transport for intra-host autonomous-vehicle pipelines, prioritizing data freshness and low latency by overwriting old data in lock-free buffers and integrating with ROS 2, offering significant latency reductions over traditional middleware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-host sensor-processor pipelines in autonomous vehicles face substantial overhead from ROS 2 DDS transports, memory copies, and deserialization, limiting the available control loop budget and safety guarantees. There is a need for a freshness-first transport that minimizes latency while maintaining basic integrity.

Method: SIM is a shared-memory transport standing beside ROS 2. It keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to maximize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with minimal code (four lines). It provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and data integrity, trading guaranteed completeness for lower latency.

Result: On NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports (FastRTPS, Zenoh), lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In production-ready Level 4 tests with Autoware.Universe, localization frequency rose from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Across latency-critical modules, perception-to-decision latency dropped from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

Conclusion: SIM demonstrates that a freshness-prioritized, intra-host transport can dramatically reduce end-to-end latency and improve safety metrics in high-speed autonomous systems, by operating alongside ROS 2 and trading guaranteed completeness for lower latency and timely data, with strong gains in localization frequency and perception-to-decision latency.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

*Ardian Selmonaj,Giacomo Del Rio,Adrian Schneider,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for 3D aerial combat that uses a two-tier decision system and a new training approach to improve learning efficiency and combat performance in realistic simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic aerial dogfights suffer from imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear dynamics; there is a need for scalable, efficient learning frameworks that can achieve mission objectives in complex simulations.

Method: Introduce a 3D multi-agent air combat environment and a hierarchical MADRL framework with two abstraction levels (low-level control maneuvers and high-level tactical commands). The approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm.

Result: Empirical results show that the hierarchical approach improves learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Conclusion: A two-level hierarchical MARL framework with curriculum and league-style training is effective for realistic 3D aerial combat, enabling better learning and performance, and offering a robust environment for evaluating such methods.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is
highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight
dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat
environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to
tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics,
curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To
this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

### [290] [Constraint-Aware Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Action Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11491)
*Murad Dawood,Usama Ahmed Siddiquie,Shahram Khorshidi,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular cost-aware regulator scales actions to limit constraint violations without overriding the policy, enabling safe RL with exploration and off-policy methods; achieves high return-to-cost and improved performance on Safety Gym.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe RL aims to reduce unsafe exploration-induced violations, but single-policy designs can create conflicting objectives or require external safety filters with prior knowledge, leading to instability or brittleness.

Method: Introduce a modular regulator that predicts constraint violations and scales the agent's actions smoothly (not by overriding the policy). It is trained to minimize violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions and can be integrated with off-policy RL methods like SAC and TD3.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion tasks with sparse costs; reduces constraint violations by up to 126x and increases returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: A cost-aware regulator provides stable, exploration-friendly safe RL compatible with off-policy methods, significantly improving safety with large gains in performance on sparse-cost tasks.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

*Luis F. Recalde,Dhruv Agrawal,Jon Arrizabalaga,Guanrui Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-quaternion manifold NMPC (DQ-NMPC) for quadrotors integrates dynamics and pose error on a global, non-singular representation, yielding improved tracking and robustness for aggressive maneuvers in constrained spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrotor control is hindered by underactuation and tight coupling between translation and rotation, with attitude singularities and poor conditioning in conventional formulations. A geometry-aware, globally non-singular NMPC could improve performance and reliability in dynamic environments.

Method: Formulate NMPC on the dual-quaternion manifold to jointly represent quadrotor dynamics and pose error directly on the DQ space, achieving compact, globally consistent dynamics that capture coupling without singularities; validate via simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: Demonstrates better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking, with position/orientation errors reduced by up to ~56% compared to a conventional base NMPC; enables aggressive trajectories with speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations to 4.2 g in a confined 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m space, where the baseline fails.

Conclusion: DQ-NMPC offers a robust, efficient framework for precise quadrotor control in complex environments, enabling high-speed, high-acceleration maneuvers with improved tracking and conditioning over traditional NMPC methods.

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

*Enli Lin,Ziyuan Yang,Qiujing Lu,Jianming Hu,Shuo Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes IntersectioNDE, a data-driven urban-intersection simulator trained on CiCross using an Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS) to achieve robust, high-fidelity, long-term multi-agent traffic simulation with heterogeneous agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban intersections involve dense, heterogeneous interactions among motorized vehicles, non-motorized vehicles, and pedestrians. Existing data-driven simulators struggle with high-dimensional joint distributions, suffer from mode collapse, and exhibit long-term instability, limiting realism and safety evaluation for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Introduce CiCross, a large-scale real-world intersection dataset capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent dynamics. Develop IntersectioNDE, a scene-aware transformer-based simulator powered by IDS, which learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets to enable marginal-to-joint simulations and improve robustness. Employ specialized training techniques to enhance stability in high-density, heterogeneous settings.

Result: IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline simulators on CiCross in terms of fidelity, stability, and the ability to reproduce complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

Conclusion: IDS with compositional dynamics offers a robust approach for simulating dense, heterogeneous urban-intersection traffic, enabling more realistic and stable long-term trajectories for autonomous vehicle safety evaluation; CiCross provides a valuable resource for benchmarking such models.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bi-level estimator-in-the-loop framework to calibrate covariance matrices and kinematic parameters, differentiating through the estimator to optimize trajectory-level objectives, improving state estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration for legged/aerial robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process and measurement noise covariances and kinematic/model parameters are often unknown or manually tuned, hurting estimator performance; a principled, data-driven calibration integrated with estimation is needed for dynamic, uncertain environments.

Method: A bi-level optimization: upper level optimizes noise covariances and kinematic parameters; lower level runs a full-information estimator; gradients are propagated through the estimator to optimize trajectory-level objectives; validated on quadrupedal and humanoid robots.

Result: Significant improvements in estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared with hand-tuned baselines; demonstrated across quadrupedal and humanoid platforms; unifies state estimation, sensor calibration, and kinematic calibration.

Conclusion: Presents a principled, data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms, unifying estimation and calibration for robust, accurate state estimation in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating
in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process
and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually
tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that
jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an
estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and
model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a
full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct
optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and
consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and
humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies
state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled,
data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.

### [294] [NaviGait: Navigating Dynamically Feasible Gait Libraries using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11542)
*Neil C. Janwani,Varun Madabushi,Maegan Tucker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviGait blends offline trajectory-optimized gait priors with reinforcement learning to enable robust, data-efficient, and interpretable bipedal locomotion, outperforming standard RL in training speed while keeping motions close to reference trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuning rewards in RL for bipedal locomotion is difficult and unintuitive. Offline trajectory optimization provides interpretable, grounded motion plans but is sensitive to disturbances; a hybrid approach could combine the strengths of both.

Method: Maintain a library of offline-optimized gaits and smoothly interpolate between them to generate continuous reference motions responsive to high-level commands. A policy provides joint-level and velocity residual corrections to modulate and stabilize these references. This decouples high-level motion generation from low-level corrections and relies on rich motion priors to simplify reward design.

Result: Faster training compared to conventional and imitation-based RL, with produced motions staying closest to the original offline reference, indicating improved stability and adherence to intended motions.

Conclusion: Decoupling high-level motion generation from low-level corrections yields a scalable, generalizable framework for dynamic and robust locomotion, leveraging trajectory optimization priors to simplify learning and improve interpretability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current off-the-shelf educational robots focus on egocentric perception, which restricts access to higher-level problems like coordinate systems and navigation. A modular, low-cost approach paired with external tracking could broaden pedagogy.

Method: Describe a holonomous robot kit paired with an external tracking system that provides precise position/orientation data, offloading computation from embedded controllers and enabling study of high-level robotics tasks.

Result: The external tracking system reduces embedded constraints, enabling exploration of high-level robotics topics previously unreachable in typical educational kits.

Conclusion: Coupling external tracking with modular, affordable robots expands the educational scope, supporting project-based, multidisciplinary robotics education.

Abstract: Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their
modularity, and also rapid prototyping made educational robotics flourish, as
it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for
project-oriented pedagogy. However, most current robot kits all are limited to
egocentric aspect of the robots perception. This makes it difficult to access
more high-level problems involving e.g. coordinates or navigation. In this
paper we introduce an educational holonomous robot kit that comes with an
external tracking system, which lightens the constraint on embedded systems,
but allows in the same time to discover high-level aspects of robotics,
otherwise unreachable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic scooping with deformable materials and complex tool–object interactions is hard; a general autonomous policy is needed that can transfer from simulation to real-world, handling diverse items, quantities, and containers.

Method: Collect scooping demonstrations in OmniGibson/NVIDIA Omniverse using privileged state information; train a diffusion-based policy to imitate demonstrations from observational input; deploy zero-shot to real-world scenarios with varying item quantities, characteristics, and containers.

Result: 465 trials across diverse scenarios; SCOOP'D outperforms all baselines and ablations, across object difficulty levels (Level 1 and Level 2).

Conclusion: SCOOP'D demonstrates the promise of diffusion-based imitation from privileged-simulated data for robotic scooping, enabling generalizable skills across deformable materials and diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

*Lennart Werner,Pol Eyschen,Sean Costello,Pierluigi Micarelli,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A retrofit 2D force- and payload estimation method for hydraulic excavators estimates end-effector interaction forces and bucket payload in real time without extra operator requirements or prior machine dynamics knowledge. It uses dynamic-model identification and optimization-based payload estimation, validated across two platforms, outperforming quasistatic and commercial baselines with ~1% payload accuracy and 13° direction, 383 N magnitude force accuracy on a 25 t machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable precise, real-time end-effector force estimation to improve automation (grading/digging) in heavy machinery while allowing retrofitting with minimal calibration and no dependence on machine-specific dynamic characteristics or slew-joint trajectories.

Method: Identify a dynamic model suitable for online force and payload estimation. Develop a 2D force- and payload-estimation algorithm that operates online using pressure and inertial measurements. Employ optimization-based payload estimation to achieve high accuracy. The approach is designed to be retrofittable and requires minimal calibration and no prior machine dynamic knowledge.

Result: Payload estimation accuracy of 1% of full scale. On a standard 25 t excavator, online force-measurement yields direction accuracy ~13 degrees and magnitude accuracy ~383 N. Validated on two excavator platforms of differing type and weight. Benchmark tests show the method outperforms a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system in both accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: A practical, generalizable retrofittable method for real-time end-effector force and bucket payload estimation in hydraulic excavators. Requires minimal calibration, no machine-specific dynamic modeling, and demonstrates superior accuracy relative to existing baselines across platforms.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and limited model capacity hinder Vision-Language-Action (VLA) based robotic manipulation, especially for complex, long-horizon tasks; there is a need for scalable, inter-agent coordination to improve reasoning and planning.

Method: Introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture with multiple interacting agents that handle environmental perception, sub-task decomposition, and action generation, enabling end-to-end outputs from task descriptions and environment inputs to robotic actions via inter-agent communication.

Conclusion: ManiAgent demonstrates the viability of agentic, multi-agent manipulation architectures for general tasks, improving performance and data efficiency and suggesting broad applicability beyond the tested benchmarks.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in robotic manipulation, their performance in complex reasoning

*Hang Liu,Yuman Gao,Sangli Teng,Yufeng Chi,Yakun Sophia Shao,Zhongyu Li,Maani Ghaffari,Koushil Sreenath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based MPC with a learned latent dynamics model and a surrogate value function trained on offline data enables robust contact-aware planning for humanoid robots, outperforming on-policy RL and enabling multi-task behavior from proprioception and ego-centric depth images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of traditional optimization-based planners in handling contact complexity and the sample inefficiency of on-policy RL, by enabling fast, contact-rich planning in unstructured environments using a demonstration-free offline dataset and a latent-space world model.

Method: Train a latent-space world model; perform sampling-based Model Predictive Control guided by a dense surrogate value function to handle sparse contact rewards and sensor noise; train entirely on offline, demonstration-free data; deploy on a physical humanoid using proprioception and ego-centric depth for planning.

Result: The approach achieves robust, real-time contact planning for tasks such as wall support after perturbation, blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches; exhibits improved data efficiency and multi-task capability compared with on-policy RL; demonstrated on a physical humanoid.

Conclusion: A scalable, single-model framework can enable contact-aware, real-time planning in unstructured environments by coupling latent dynamics with MPC and a learned value function trained on offline data, bridging optimization and reinforcement learning and enabling versatile, multi-task manipulation and locomotion.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

### [300] [Phys2Real: Fusing VLM Priors with Interactive Online Adaptation for Uncertainty-Aware Sim-to-Real Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11689)
*Maggie Wang,Stephen Tian,Aiden Swann,Ola Shorinwa,Jiajun Wu,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Phys2Real is a real-to-sim-to-real RL framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) inferred priors over physical parameters and online parameter estimation to improve sim-to-real transfer for manipulation tasks, outperforming domain randomization on planar pushing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring policies learned in simulation to the real world is challenging when tasks depend on precise dynamics. Existing sim-to-real methods (e.g., domain randomization) may not capture hard-to-estimate physical parameters. The paper proposes leveraging VLMs to provide priors on physical parameters and online adaptation to refine them, enabling better real-world performance.

Method: Three components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction via 3D Gaussian splatting; (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters; (3) online estimation of physical parameters from interaction data using ensemble-based uncertainty quantification, with policies conditioned on interpretable physical parameters and fusion of VLM priors with online estimates.

Result: Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline on planar pushing tasks: 100% vs 79% success for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% for the top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average hammer pushing. Ablations show that using both VLM priors and interaction data is essential for success.

Conclusion: Integrating VLM-derived physical priors with online interaction-based estimation and uncertainty-aware fusion enables more effective sim-to-real transfer for dynamics-sensitive manipulation tasks, as demonstrated by stronger performance and the ablation results.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:

### [301] [Direct Routing Gradient (DRGrad): A Personalized Information Surgery for Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09643)
*Yuguang Liu,Yiyun Miao,Luyao Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRGrad introduces a personalized routing gradient framework to handle task conflicts in multi-task learning for recommender systems, improving performance (AUC) without added model complexity by routing and weighting gradients per task based on personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning in industrial recommenders suffers negative transfer and the seesaw problem due to conflicting task correlations. There is a need to utilize personalized information to balance task gradients and reduce inter-task interference.

Method: DRGrad comprises three components: a router to decide how to route gradients, an updater to adjust gradient contributions, and a personalized gate network to tailor routing to individual users. It judges the stakes between tasks during training to aggregate all valid gradients for each task, aiming to reduce conflicts without increasing model complexity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a real-world 15 billion-sample dataset shows DRGrad outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in AUC, indicating effective conflict management and noise handling without added complexity. Additional experiments on Census-income and synthetic datasets demonstrate DRGrad's ability to route task stakes across varying correlations and personalization levels.

Conclusion: DRGrad effectively mitigates task conflicts in industrial-scale MTL for recommender systems, leveraging personalization to balance gradients and improve performance without increasing model complexity; it generalizes across datasets with different task correlations.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework integrating CCTV surveillance with multi-source data descriptors using spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining (FEM) for sequential pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for real-time traffic state forecasting; evaluated on CityFlowV2 with high accuracy and 46 sustained congestion alerts; demonstrates practical value for proactive intelligent transportation systems (ITS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid urbanization causes congestion, pollution, and inefficiencies; conventional static signaling and manual monitoring are inadequate. There is a need for a unified, real-time, adaptive traffic management framework that fuses video analytics with multi-source data to predict and manage traffic states.

Method: A framework combining spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for discovering sequential traffic patterns, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for robust traffic state forecasting. Evaluation on CityFlowV2 (313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras).

Result: Prediction accuracy: 98.46%. Macro metrics: precision 0.9800, recall 0.9839, F1 0.9819. FEM revealed significant sequential patterns (e.g., moderate-congested transitions) with confidence >55%. The system generated 46 sustained congestion alerts.

Conclusion: Video stream analytics integrated with multi-source data can enable real-time, proactive, multi-level intelligent transportation systems, improving urban mobility and safety.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HA30K: a 31k-material Helmholtz dataset for learning acoustic wave solutions; baseline diffusion-based model (Stable Diffusion + ControlNet) used to predict pressure fields as images; enables fast, parallelized surrogates for early-stage design, trading accuracy for speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of traditional solvers (e.g., FEM) for complex acoustic materials and Helmholtz problems; a large, labeled dataset plus data-driven surrogates could accelerate exploration and design.

Method: Create HA30K with 31,000 material geometries and corresponding pressure-field solutions to the Helmholtz equation. Represent pressure fields as images and train a diffusion-based surrogate using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet to map geometry to pressure-field images. Leverage GPU to run multiple simulations in parallel; allow adjustable diffusion steps at inference to balance speed and quality.

Result: Demonstrates the potential of diffusion-based surrogates to accelerate Helmholtz solutions: parallelized inference reduces computation time, enabling rapid exploration in early-stage research. The approach trades some accuracy for speed and simplicity and avoids reliance on traditional solvers.

Conclusion: Data-driven, diffusion-based surrogates offer a promising route for fast Helmholtz solutions in complex acoustics. They can accelerate material design and sound-design workflows, especially in early stages, but should be complemented with physics-based solvers for accuracy and generalization improvements in future work.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

*Filippo Rinaldi,Aniello Panariello,Giacomo Salici,Fengyuan Liu,Marco Ciccone,Angelo Porrello,Simone Calderara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradFix transfers task-specific vectors across pre-trained models by aligning the gradient sign structure of the target model, enabling few-shot adaptation without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reuse task adaptations across different pre-trained models and versions, a parameter-efficient transfer method is needed even when the target task vectors do not align well in the new model's parameter space.

Method: GradFix approximates the target model's ideal gradient sign structure and masks the source task vector accordingly. It computes a few gradients at the target model, yielding an update that is aligned with the target loss landscape and effectively rebases the task vector onto the new pre-training, with no further fine-tuning.

Result: A theoretical guarantee of first-order descent is provided. Empirically, GradFix achieves significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, outperforming naive task-vector addition and naive few-shot fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GradFix offers a simple, data-efficient transfer for task vectors across models by leveraging gradient-sign structure, enabling effective adaptation with minimal labeled data and without extra fine-tuning across vision and language tasks.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Point-set neural network on sparse NOvA detector views (XZ and YZ) with cross-view mixing; achieves 96.8% AUC using <10% of prior memory, outperforming independent-view processing (85.4%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently map raw detector hits to source particles and identify particle types in NOvA. Data are two sparse 2D views (XZ, YZ) requiring memory-efficient methods beyond traditional clustering and CNNs.

Method: Introduce a point-set neural network operating on sparse XZ and YZ matrices with an operation that mixes information from both views to jointly classify hits and particles.

Result: Achieves 96.8% AUC, higher than processing both views independently (85.4%), while using less than 10% of the memory of previous methods.

Conclusion: The cross-view, memory-efficient point-set network improves hit-to-particle association and particle identification in NOvA, demonstrating the benefit of marrying sparse data representations with multi-view information fusion.

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

*Luca Scimeca,Thomas Jiralerspong,Berton Earnshaw,Jason Hartford,Yoshua Bengio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD) introduces inductive bias into diffusion models via a frequency-diagonal forward noise covariance, improving performance and enabling selective robustness to band-limited corruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inductive biases in diffusion probabilistic models are largely implicit; explicitly incorporating controllable spectral biases can better align the model with the target data distribution and known corruptions.

Method: Replace the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance that unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings; derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances; show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as t→0; analyze how anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data.

Result: Empirically, the anisotropic forward noise outperforms standard diffusion on multiple vision datasets and enables selective omission of known corruptions confined to specific frequency bands.

Conclusion: Carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, principled way to tailor inductive bias in diffusion models, balancing fidelity and robustness through spectral control.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

*Ali Jaberi,Amin Sadeghi,Runze Zhang,Zhaoyang Zhao,Qiuyu Shi,Robert Black,Zoya Sadighi,Jason Hattrick-Simpers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X2 loss function yields best fit quality in EIS ECM fitting; log-B is a strong alternative offering faster fitting (~1.4x) and lower MAPE for most components; log-BW is proposed but not highlighted as the top performer; choice depends on whether the priority is fit quality or scalability to large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve parameter estimation for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by introducing loss functions derived from the Bode representation and assessing their impact on convergence, efficiency, and accuracy in data-driven ECM fitting.

Method: Introduce two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, based on Bode representation of EIS. Evaluate their performance against existing losses using a large synthetic EIS dataset. Fit ECM parameters via nonlinear least squares and assess using R^2, chi-squared, computational time, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between predicted and true component values. Conduct statistical comparisons to determine the influence of loss choice on convergence, efficiency, fit quality, and parameter accuracy.

Result: X2 loss function achieved the highest performance across multiple quality-of-fit metrics. The log-B loss offered a slightly lower quality of fit but was approximately 1.4 times faster and produced lower MAPE for most circuit components, making it a strong alternative for large-scale LS fitting. The abstract also introduces log-BW, but its relative performance is not summarized as clearly as X2 or log-B in the provided text.

Conclusion: The loss function chosen for nonlinear least squares fitting in EIS ECMs materially affects convergence behavior, computational efficiency, fit quality, and parameter accuracy. For applications prioritizing fit quality, X2 is preferred; for large-scale data-driven tasks where speed and component-wise MAPE are important, log-B provides a compelling alternative. log-BW is a proposed option with trade-offs that require further clarification on its performance.

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

### [308] [Semantic-Cohesive Knowledge Distillation for Deep Cross-modal Hashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09664)
*Changchang Sun,Vickie Chen,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SODA introduces semantic cohesive knowledge distillation for deep cross-modal hashing, treating multi-labels as a textual modality and distilling cross-modal semantics from image and label to align them in a shared Hamming space, improving performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods struggle to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data for multi-label semantics, causing semantic misalignment and hindering cross-modal retrieval performance.

Method: Formulate multi-label information as an additional textual modality via ground-truth label prompts. Develop a cross-modal teacher network to distill semantic characteristics between image and label modalities, learning a well-mapped Hamming space for images. Use this space as prior to guide a cross-modal student network, preserving semantic similarities between image and text modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that SODA outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Semantic cohesive knowledge distillation effectively bridges the modality gap in deep cross-modal hashing by integrating label-derived text as an auxiliary modality and employing teacher–student distillation to align image and text semantics in a unified Hamming space.

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [309] [LMCache: An Efficient KV Cache Layer for Enterprise-Scale LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09665)
*Yihua Cheng,Yuhan Liu,Jiayi Yao,Yuwei An,Xiaokun Chen,Shaoting Feng,Yuyang Huang,Samuel Shen,Kuntai Du,Junchen Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LMCache is an open-source KV caching system for LLM inferences that extracts/stores KV caches from engines (vLLM, SGLang) and shares them across engines/queries to boost throughput; it enables cache offloading and cross-engine transfer, with optimizations and a flexible API, achieving up to 15x throughput improvements with vLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM inference tends to treat engines and queries independently, leading to wasted computation and underutilization. The paper argues that reusing KV caches across queries and cross-engine deployment require efficient offloading and communication of KV caches.

Method: Develop LMCache: a modular KV cache caching layer that extracts/stores KV caches from modern LLM engines and shares them across engines/queries. Supports cache offloading (prefix reuse) and prefill-decode disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). Implements optimized data movement (batched transfers, compute/I-O pipelining), a modular KV cache connector, and a first-class API (pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, compression) for orchestration across GPU/CPU/storage/network.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows up to 15x throughput improvement when combined with vLLM across workloads. LMCache has gained substantial enterprise adoption.

Conclusion: LMCache stands as the first and most efficient open-source KV caching solution, demonstrating that shared KV caches across engines/queries can yield substantial performance gains and offering design lessons for future KV caching systems; source code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source

### [310] [Spatial Uncertainty Quantification in Wildfire Forecasting for Climate-Resilient Emergency Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09666)
*Aditya Chakravarty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread forecasting using multimodal Earth observation data. Finds coherent uncertainty near fire perimeters, with 20–60 m buffer zones around predicted firelines; vegetation health and fire activity drive uncertainty; enables risk-aware emergency planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing wildfire risk and reliable forecasts with uncertainty quantification are needed for risk-aware decision making and emergency planning.

Method: Systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. Introduces a novel distance metric to identify high-uncertainty regions and uses feature attribution to determine uncertainty drivers (vegetation health, fire activity).

Result: Predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near fire perimeters. High-uncertainty regions form consistent 20–60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines. Vegetation health and fire activity are identified as primary drivers of uncertainty.

Conclusion: This work supports the development of robust wildfire management systems and emergency planning by highlighting where forecasts are less certain and what factors drive that uncertainty, aiding communities adapting to increasing fire risk under climate change.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

### [311] [A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Framework with Metaheuristic Optimization for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09668)
*Maryam Abdollahi Shamami,Babak Teimourpour,Farshad Sharifi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable, efficient DDI predictor that fuses molecular embeddings (Mol2Vec + SMILES-BERT) with a leakage-free, rule-based RBScore and optimizes a lightweight classifier via a three-stage metaheuristic (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), achieving strong DrugBank performance (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867) and generalizing to a T2DM patient cohort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIs are a major source of adverse events and healthcare costs; knowing non-interactions is equally important for safe prescription. There is a need for models that are both accurate and interpretable, and that leverage domain knowledge without overfitting to interaction labels.

Method: Combine two complementary molecular embeddings—Mol2Vec (fragment-level patterns) and SMILES-BERT (contextual chemical features)—with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without using interaction labels. Train a lightweight neural classifier using a novel three-stage metaheuristic optimizer (RSmpl-ACO-PSO) to balance global exploration and local refinement.

Result: On DrugBank data: ROC-AUC 0.911 and PR-AUC 0.867. The model generalizes to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort.

Conclusion: Embedding fusion, RBScore, and the three-stage optimizer collectively enhance precision and robustness, yielding an interpretable, efficient framework to support safer drug therapies and informed clinical decisions.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

*Jacopo Lenti,Lorenzo Costantini,Ariadna Fosch,Anna Monticelli,David Scala,Marco Pangallo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a NF+VAE pipeline for generating geolocated synthetic populations by mapping latitude/longitude to a latent space with Normalizing Flows and combining with non-spatial features in a Variational Autoencoder; evaluated on 121 diverse datasets; outperforms copula-based and uniform-area baselines; enables high-resolution, privacy-preserving synthetic geographies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to generate synthetic populations with explicit coordinates for accurate spatial analysis, but latitude/longitude distributions are highly irregular with large empty spaces. Existing methods underperform in preserving spatial structure and privacy.

Method: Map spatial coordinates into a regular latent space using Normalizing Flows, then integrate with non-spatial features in a Variational Autoencoder to learn the joint distribution and generate synthetic homes; develop an evaluation framework assessing spatial accuracy, practical utility, and privacy; compare against copula-based methods and uniform geographic allocation across 121 datasets.

Result: NF+VAE outperforms popular benchmarks (including copula-based methods and uniform allocation) in preserving the statistical properties of real homes across 121 datasets with diverse geographies; demonstrates the ability to generate geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution.

Conclusion: The NF+VAE approach enables realistic, fine-grained, geolocated synthetic populations while incorporating spatial autocorrelation and joint spatial-non-spatial distributions; broad applicability to risk assessment, evacuation, epidemic modeling, and transport planning, with an emphasis on privacy-preserving evaluation.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An enhanced Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2) is developed to predict hotspot formation under weak-to-moderate shocks in crystalline energetic materials, outperforming Fourier neural operator and neural ODE in capturing shear localization dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safe storage/handling of energetic materials by efficiently simulating hotspot formation and shear heating under weaker shocks, where current models are less explored and full simulations are computationally expensive.

Method: Improved PARCv2 architecture to rapidly predict shear localization and plastic heating; benchmarked against Fourier neural operator and neural ODE to assess spatiotemporal dynamics of shear bands in EMs under weak-to-moderate shock.

Result: PARCv2 demonstrates superior performance in capturing spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation; all models have failure modes; domain-specific design is important for robust AI-accelerated simulations of reactive materials.

Conclusion: Domain-specific AI tools like physics-aware networks are essential for robustly modeling reactive materials; addressing weak-to-moderate shock regimes remains critical; results underscore need to incorporate microstructural and nonlinear reaction front dynamics.

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

### [314] [Coupled Data and Measurement Space Dynamics for Enhanced Diffusion Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09676)
*Shayan Mohajer Hamidi,En-Hui Yang,Ben Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework (C-DPS) that couples measurement and data spaces to sample the posterior for inverse problems, avoiding constraint tuning and likelihood approximations, with superior performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches either enforce measurement consistency via heuristic projections or rely on approximate likelihoods p(y|x), which can introduce artifacts and instability in high-noise or complex settings. A principled, well-defined posterior sampling framework is needed for robust inverse problem solving.

Method: Introduce a forward diffusion process in the measurement space y_t that runs in parallel with the data-space diffusion x_t, enabling a closed-form posterior p(x_{t-1} | x_t, y_{t-1}). This coupling yields accurate, recursive sampling from the joint diffusion posterior without constraint tuning or likelihood approximation.

Result: Empirical results show C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple inverse problem benchmarks, in both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

Conclusion: Coupling data and measurement space diffusion provides a principled posterior sampler for inverse problems, eliminating the need for constraint tuning or approximated likelihoods and improving robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

### [315] [Using LLMs to Directly Guess Conditional Expectations Can Improve Efficiency in Causal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09684)
*Chris Engh,P. M. Aronow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-assisted predictions used as predictors in double machine learning improve causal effect estimation by augmenting nuisance-function predictors with generative-model outputs trained on historical data; demonstrated on a small jewelry auction dataset with efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional confounding hinders accurate causal estimation; leveraging the historical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of generative models can help overcome the curse of dimensionality and enhance estimators beyond embeddings alone.

Method: In the Double Machine Learning (DML) framework, incorporate predictions from generative models trained on historical data as predictors for conditional expectation functions; compare against embeddings-only approaches; assess via a case study on a small online jewelry auction dataset.

Result: Including LLM-generated guesses as predictors yields more efficient (lower-variance) causal estimates than using only embeddings from models; demonstrates practical gains in small-sample settings.

Conclusion: LLMs can augment causal inference in high-dimensional settings by providing informative auxiliary predictions, helping to alleviate curse-of-dimensionality issues; suggests broader applicability in econometrics and statistics.

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization gaps in deep learning by leveraging differential equations to unify design and analysis.

Result: Provides numerical comparisons illustrating characteristics and performance of the models.

Conclusion: Highlights promising directions for integrating differential equations with deep learning to achieve better interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

### [317] [On the Occurence of Critical Learning Periods in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09687)
*Stanisław Pawlak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks exhibit critical learning periods where training on deficit data leads to lasting performance gaps; researchers show that cyclic learning rate schedules or warm-start strategies can prevent this deficit-induced loss, effectively serving as deficit pretraining, thus linking warm-starting to critical period theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate and expand the concept of critical learning periods in neural network training, investigate how warm-starting relates to deficit pretraining, and identify practical training schedules that avoid plasticity loss.

Method: Replicate key findings from prior work on critical learning periods, broaden the experimental scope beyond the original study, evaluate warm-starting as deficit pretraining, and test a cyclic learning rate schedule to prevent degradation during deficit training.

Result: Deficit-phase training reduces network plasticity and prevents reaching parity with scratch-trained models; however, employing a cyclic learning rate schedule or warm-starting can avert these issues, effectively functioning as deficit pretraining and mitigating the negative effects of early deficit data.

Conclusion: The findings have practical implications for neural network training by showing that cyclic learning rates can bypass critical-period-related performance losses and that warm-starting is theoretically connected to deficit pretraining, suggesting new training protocols and a tighter link between critical periods and warm-start strategies.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

### [318] [Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms on Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09691)
*Tejash Varsani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive privacy budgets with DP in federated learning (via Laplace/Gaussian mechanisms) and adaptive clipping show promise to maintain accuracy under privacy constraints, evaluated on IID/non-IID data with varying client participation; however, details on privacy accounting, baselines, and broader validation are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the performance loss caused by fixed-DP noise in federated learning by making privacy budgets and gradient clipping adaptive, so privacy can be preserved with better utility.

Method: Apply DP mechanisms (Laplace and Gaussian) with adaptive privacy budgets; extend the SelecEval simulator; introduce adaptive clipping for the Gaussian mechanism to update gradient sensitivity dynamically, rather than using a fixed clipping/sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments across privacy budgets, IID/non-IID datasets, and varying numbers of selected clients per round; 200 training rounds; findings indicate that adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping help sustain model accuracy while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: Adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping appear beneficial for privacy-preserving federated learning, suggesting a viable path to better utility under DP constraints; further validation and more details are needed on privacy accounting, baselines, and generalizability.

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

### [319] [Neural PDE Solvers with Physics Constraints: A Comparative Study of PINNs, DRM, and WANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09693)
*Jiakang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified benchmarking study comparing three mesh-free neural PDE solvers—PINNs, the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs)—across Poisson problems up to 5D and 1D/2D Schrödinger equations (including KH-transformed laser-driven cases). All methods reach very low L2 errors under a common protocol with forced boundary conditions, forced nodes, and orthogonality regularization. PINNs most reliable for accuracy and excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off for stationary problems; WANs are competitive but more sensitive, particularly without effective weak-form constraints. Sensitivity analyses show boundary conditions simplify training, width matters more than depth for single networks, and major gains occur within 5000–10000 epochs. The KH case demonstrates transferability. The work offers practical guidelines for method selection and outlines extensions such as time-dependent formulations, adaptive residual sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of traditional mesh-based PDE solvers in high dimensions and the scarcity of analytical solutions motivate a systematic, mesh-free comparison of leading neural PDE solvers to establish reliability, transferability, and practical guidelines.

Method: Evaluate PINNs, DRM, and WANs under a common protocol on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and Schrödinger equations in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), plus a KH-transformed laser-driven Schrödinger case. Employ forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Conduct sensitivity analyses on boundary-loss tuning, network width vs depth, and training epochs (observing 5k–10k as a sweet spot). Extend to time-dependent formulations and neural domain decomposition as future work.

Result: All three methods achieve low L2 errors in the range 1e-6 to 1e-9 with FBCs, FNs, and OG. PINNs are most reliable for accuracy and recovering excited spectra; DRM provides the best accuracy–runtime balance for stationary problems; WANs are more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are effectively used. FBCs remove boundary-loss tuning requirements; network width influences performance more than depth for single-network solvers; most gains occur within 5k–10k training epochs. KH-transformed case demonstrates transferability of the toolkit to non-canonical PDEs.

Conclusion: Physics-guided neural solvers are credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs. The study offers practical guidelines for method selection and outlines extensions: time-dependent DRM/WAN formulations, adaptive residual sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

### [320] [Kelp: A Streaming Safeguard for Large Models via Latent Dynamics-Guided Risk Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09694)
*Xiaodan Li,Mengjie Wu,Yao Zhu,Yunna Lv,YueFeng Chen,Cen Chen,Jianmei Guo,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kelp is a streaming plug-in for risk detection in LM generation that uses a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head and Anchored Temporal Consistency loss, plus a benchmark (StreamGuardBench); it achieves higher detection F1 with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended LMs risk generating harmful or biased content; post-hoc guardrails can miss unsafe content and add latency, limiting detection accuracy. A streaming, model-integrated detector is needed, along with rigorous evaluation.

Method: Kelp is a plug-in framework that accesses intermediate LM hidden states via a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head to model how risk evolves over the generated sequence. It adds an Anchored Temporal Consistency loss to enforce a benign-then-harmful temporal prior, ensuring monotonic risk predictions. Evaluation uses StreamGuardBench, a model-grounded benchmark with on-the-fly responses in text and vision-language tasks.

Result: Kelp outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in probes (≈15.61% higher average F1), using only 20M parameters and adding <0.5 ms per-token latency, across diverse models and datasets.

Conclusion: A streaming, low-latency guardrail personalized for LM generation can provide accurate real-time risk moderation. The combination of Sliding Latent Dynamics, ATC, and StreamGuardBench offers a scalable and rigorous approach to safe content generation.

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Motivation: Compression methods (pruning, quantization, low-rank decomposition) save memory and compute but often cause significant accuracy degradation if applied directly. There is a need for a general, stable transition mechanism that works across domains and compression techniques.

Method: Train the original (uncompressed) model and its compressed version in parallel during fine-tuning. Gradually reduce the contribution of the uncompressed model while increasing the compressed model’s contribution, enabling a smooth transition to the compressed form. This approach is demonstrated across computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks and compatible with multiple compression strategies.

Result: VCON yields consistent improvements across benchmarks: typical accuracy gains exceed 3%, with some configurations showing up to 20% improvement. It provides a generalizable method that enhances existing compression techniques.

Conclusion: VCON offers a general, stable framework for transitioning to compressed models, improving performance across domains and compression strategies, and mitigating accuracy degradation during compression.

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

### [322] [Operator Learning for Power Systems Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09704)
*Matthew Schlegel,Matthew E. Taylor,Mostafa Farrokhabadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Operator-learning surrogates with time-step-invariance enable zero-shot super-resolution in time-domain power-system simulations, showing initial proof-of-concept in stable/unstable regimes on a simple test system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational burden of high-fidelity, ultra-fast time-domain simulations (1-50 microseconds) for renewable-penetrated grids, enabling scalable, real-time analysis and climate-change mitigation.

Method: Benchmark three operator-learning methods on a simple test system; investigate simulation time step–invariance; evaluate zero-shot super-resolution (train on coarse step, infer at fine step) and cross-regime generalization (stable vs unstable dynamics).

Result: The study demonstrates viability of time-step-invariance for operator-learning surrogates: successful zero-shot super-resolution and cross-regime generalization on the test system, indicating potential for fast, scalable simulations as a surrogate model.

Conclusion: Operator learning is a promising direction for speeding up time-domain power-system simulations with renewables; however, the work is a proof-of-concept on a simplified system, and further research is needed to handle practical grid complexities, stability guarantees, data efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

### [323] [A Multi-Component Reward Function with Policy Gradient for Automated Feature Selection with Dynamic Regularization and Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09705)
*Sudip Khadka,L. S. Paudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An RL-driven framework that jointly selects feature subsets and mitigates bias during training, balancing accuracy and fairness rather than relying on static preprocessing or post hoc correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail when hidden dependencies influence predictions; there is a need for a dynamic, integrated approach that co-optimizes predictive performance and fairness within the training process.

Method: Design of a multi-component reward for an RL agent that selects feature subsets, defines the action space over feature sets, and integrates the agent with ensemble learning to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity.

Result: The framework enables adaptive feature selection under correlated predictors, aiming to prevent bias re-emergence by incorporating fairness into the training objective rather than relying solely on preprocessing or post hoc fixes.

Conclusion: A flexible and generalizable method for bias-aware feature selection within learning pipelines, potentially reducing biased outcomes in settings with hidden dependencies.

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

### [324] [Group-Adaptive Adversarial Learning for Robust Fake News Detection Against Malicious Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09712)
*Zhao Tong,Chunlin Gong,Yimeng Gu,Haichao Shi,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Xiao-Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust fake-news detector against adversarial comments using category-based attacks, category-specific LLM augmentation, and Dirichlet-adaptive training to maintain performance while increasing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FND models achieve strong accuracy in standard settings but are vulnerable to adversarial comments crafted by humans or LLMs. There is a need for training strategies that anticipate and defend against such perturbations.

Method: Step 1: categorize adversarial comments into perceptual, cognitive, and societal. Step 2: generate diverse attacks for each category using LLMs to augment training data. Step 3: apply a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting Mechanism) to dynamically reweight learning focus across categories during training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed method preserves strong detection accuracy while substantially boosting robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Conclusion: Taxonomy-guided, category-aware attack generation combined with adaptive training improves FND robustness without sacrificing accuracy, highlighting the value of structured attack design and adaptive learning in adversarial settings.

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

### [325] [High-Power Training Data Identification with Provable Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09717)
*Zhenlong Liu,Hao Zeng,Weiran Huang,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI) identifies training data with strict FDR control, using per-point p-values scaled by a data-usage estimator and a data-dependent threshold to select data, achieving provable FDR control and higher power across LLMs and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying training data within large models is important for copyright, privacy, and fair evaluation. Existing approaches lack statistical guarantees; current FDR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated. A method with provable FDR control and higher power is needed.

Method: Compute p-values for each data point using a set of known unseen data, construct a conservative estimator for the test-set data usage proportion, scale the p-values by this estimator, and select all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent threshold, yielding a set of training data with provable FDR control.

Result: Extensive experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs) and datasets show that PTDI strictly controls FDR and achieves higher power compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: PTDI provides provable, strict FDR control for training data identification in large models and demonstrates boosted power across diverse models and datasets, addressing limitations of previous methods with strong assumptions.

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

### [326] [Federated k-Means via Generalized Total Variation Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09718)
*A. Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated k-means via GTVMin with a penalty between neighbor devices; privacy-preserving since only aggregated information is shared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable clustering across distributed devices with private datasets without exposing raw data; address privacy in k-means through a graph total variation minimization (GTVMin) formulation.

Method: Formulate federated k-means as a GTVMin problem; each device updates local centroids by solving a modified local k-means that includes a penalty term measuring discrepancy with neighboring devices' centroids; inter-device communication is restricted to aggregated information.

Result: The abstract claims privacy-friendly operation due to aggregate information exchange; no quantitative results or convergence guarantees are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, privacy-preserving federated clustering framework by coupling local models via GTVMin; requires further theoretical and empirical validation for convergence, scalability, and clustering quality.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

### [327] [ICL-Router: In-Context Learned Model Representations for LLM Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09719)
*Chenxu Wang,Hao Li,Yiqun Zhang,Linyao Chen,Jianhao Chen,Ping Jian,Peng Ye,Qiaosheng Zhang,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel in-context vector-based routing method for LLM ensembles that aligns query representations with a router. It enables seamless integration of new models without retraining and achieves state-of-the-art routing in both ID and OOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current routing methods rely on accurate model representations and often require retraining when new models are added, hindering scalability. There is a need for scalable, performant routing that can incorporate new models without retraining.

Method: Two-stage approach. Stage 1: Embed and project queries into vectors; train a projector and an LLM-based router to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router’s semantic space. Stage 2: Profile each candidate model on a query set; the router learns, from in-context vectors of query and model performance, to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. This setup allows adding new models without retraining the router.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks and supports seamless integration of new models without retraining. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: In-context vectors provide a scalable, effective means to represent model capabilities for routing in LLM ensembles, enabling dynamic model composition with minimal retraining requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

### [328] [It's 2025 -- Narrative Learning is the new baseline to beat for explainable machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09723)
*Gregory D. Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Narrative Learning defines models in natural language, iteratively refining via explanatory prompts instead of numerical optimization, achieving higher accuracy than baseline explainable models on 5/6 datasets (synthetic and natural) by 2025 or earlier as LMs improve; lexicostatistics trends examined to gauge explanation comprehensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond optimization-based, opaque models by leveraging language models to define and refine classification criteria through explanations, potentially improving accuracy and interpretability as LM capabilities grow.

Method: Models are defined entirely in natural language and refined via explanatory prompts rather than numerical loss minimization. Evaluations on 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets, comparing against 7 baseline explainable ML models.

Result: Narrative Learning outperforms baseline explainable models on 5 of 6 datasets by 2025 or earlier, aided by advances in language models; the study also reports trends in lexicostatistics of model outputs as a proxy for explanation comprehensibility.

Conclusion: Narrative Learning demonstrates promise as a language-model-driven alternative to traditional optimization-based ML, with potential to surpass baselines as LM quality improves; further work should examine the durability of explanations and the relationship between language quality and task performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

### [329] [Evaluating LLM-Based Process Explanations under Progressive Behavioral-Input Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09732)
*P. van Oerle,R. H. Bemthuis,F. A. Bukhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can explain process-models derived from logs, and explanation quality remains largely stable under moderate progressive input reduction; a dual-LLM pipeline evaluates explanations, indicating a feasible cost–quality trade-off for LLM-assisted process analysis on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability of complex process models is computationally expensive when using large abstractions; this study explores whether reducing input size (prefixes of a fixed log) can maintain explanation quality, enabling more efficient use of LLMs.

Method: Discover models at multiple input sizes by using progressively smaller prefixes of a fixed log; prompt an LLM to generate explanations; use a second LLM to assess completeness, bottlenecks, and suggested improvements.

Result: On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under moderate input reduction; evaluation relies on LLM-based comparative signals rather than ground truth; demonstrates a practical cost–quality trade-off and feasibility of resource-constrained, LLM-assisted process analysis.

Conclusion: The study indicates a viable path to computationally efficient LLM-assisted process analysis in resource-constrained settings, though results are exploratory, based on synthetic data and LLM-based scores, necessitating validation on real logs with ground-truth metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

### [330] [ARROW: An Adaptive Rollout and Routing Method for Global Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09734)
*Jindong Tian,Yifei Ding,Ronghui Xu,Hao Miao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARROW introduces Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing for Global Weather Forecasting. It uses multi-interval forecasting with a Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts to capture cross-scale atmospheric dynamics, Ring Positional Encoding for Earth's latitude, and an RL-based adaptive rollout scheduler to select forecast intervals, achieving state-of-the-art global forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current weather forecasting models forecast over fixed short intervals and rely on naive autoregression for long horizons, which poorly capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dependencies and lead to error accumulation.

Method: A multi-interval forecasting model with Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts to learn both common and scale-specific dynamics; Ring Positional Encoding to encode the Earth’s circular latitude structure; an adaptive rollout scheduler via reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable forecast interval given the current state.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on global weather forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive multi-scale routing and the proposed architectural components.

Conclusion: ARROW offers a promising adaptive, multi-scale forecasting paradigm for global weather, addressing both multi-scale dependencies and rollout-induced errors, with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

*Qianyou Sun,Jiexin Zheng,Bohan Jin,Lihua Chen,Yijie Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InterCorpRel-LLM is a cross-modal GNN-LLM framework leveraging proprietary supply-chain data to jointly model corporate structure and semantics, achieving strong supply relation identification and zero-shot competitor discovery with a compact 7B backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify inter-firm relationships (supply, competition) at scale where data is sparse and context-dependent; graph structure alone or text alone are insufficient; integrate structural and semantic signals.

Method: Propose InterCorpRel-LLM; fuse graph neural networks with large language models; train on three tasks using a proprietary FactSet-derived dataset: company graph matching, industry classification, and supply relation prediction; lightweight training with a 7B-parameter backbone; evaluation against baselines including GPT-5; demonstration of zero-shot competitor identification.

Result: Substantially outperforms strong baselines on supply relation identification (F-score 0.8543 vs 0.2287); demonstrates zero-shot competitor identification; generalizes to unseen firms/relationships.

Conclusion: A practical, robust tool for mapping and reasoning about complex corporate networks, aiding analysts and risk management in dynamic markets; cross-modal modeling improves both relational reasoning and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

*Ayoub Bouguettaya,Elizabeth M. Stuart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bottom-up ML-derived lexical model from an adjective list poorly matches Big Five in real-world text: Big Five categories (esp. Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism) explain Reddit communities better; ML clusters failed to capture Extraversion and lacked psychometric coherence; semantic structure appears context-dependent; ML can help validate but not replace Big Five.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test whether a data-driven, bottom-up lexical approach can yield reliable personality dimensions from language and whether such a model can match or surpass established theories like the Big Five.

Method: Constructed a bottom-up personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning. Analyzed one million Reddit comments to compare its descriptive utility against the Big Five (focusing on Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism) and to assess recovery of Extraversion and psychometric coherence.

Result: Big Five provided a more powerful and interpretable description of online communities. The ML-based clusters offered no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover Extraversion, and lacked psychometric coherence relative to the Big Five.

Conclusion: The Big Five appears robust; personality's semantic structure is context-dependent. Machine learning can help validate ecological validity but is unlikely to replace established theories like the Big Five.

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

### [333] [Reliable Active Learning from Unreliable Labels via Neural Collapse Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09740)
*Atharv Goel,Sharat Agarwal,Saket Anand,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCAL-R: a reliable Active Learning framework that uses neural collapse geometry to select informative samples under label noise and distribution shifts by combining a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score and a Feature Fluctuation score, achieving stronger performance with fewer labels on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 and better OOD robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Learning struggles when labels are noisy or data distributions shift; traditional AL heuristics can amplify mislabeled or redundant samples. The work proposes leveraging emergent neural collapse geometry to create reliable acquisition signals.

Method: Introduce NCAL-R with two complementary signals: (i) Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score measuring how candidate samples stabilize or distort inter-class geometry, and (ii) Feature Fluctuation score measuring temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. Combine these signals to prioritize samples that preserve class separation and highlight ambiguity, mitigating label noise and redundancy.

Result: Empirical results on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show NCAL-R consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: Geometric reliability criteria can make Active Learning more robust to annotation errors and distribution shifts, supporting trustworthy deployment; code is available at the authors' repository.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Language Models (LVLMs) show promise across various tasks, their application in
automating patent writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
PatentVision, a multimodal framework that integrates textual and visual inputs
such as patent claims and drawings to generate complete patent specifications.
Built on advanced LVLMs, PatentVision enhances accuracy by combining fine tuned
vision language models with domain specific training tailored to patents.
Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and
functional connections, leading to richer and more precise results. This study
underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing
a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency.
PatentVision not only advances patent drafting but also lays the groundwork for
broader use of LVLMs in specialized areas, potentially transforming
intellectual property management and innovation processes.

### [336] [Leveraging Shared Prototypes for a Multimodal Pulse Motion Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09764)
*Wanting Mao,Maxwell A Xu,Harish Haresamudram,Mithun Saha,Santosh Kumar,James Matthew Rehg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMM introduces a shared prototype dictionary to anchor multi-modal time-series representations without explicit negative sampling, improving alignment and interpretability; applied to a Pulse Motion foundation model with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling multi-modal biosignal time-series (ECG, PPG, EDA, accelerometry) requires a common embedding space. Existing SSL methods rely on contrastive losses that overfit to easily aligned features and misclassify valid cross-modal relations as negatives, leading to fragmented, non-generalizable embeddings.

Method: ProtoMM uses a shared prototype dictionary to cluster representations around shared prototypes across modalities, rather than relying on negative sampling. This creates a common embedding space (a 'common language' for physiological signals) and anchors heterogeneous modalities.

Result: Outperforms contrastive-only and prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering improved interpretability of learned features.

Conclusion: The approach provides a coherent, modality-agnostic embedding framework for physiological signals, enabling a robust Pulse Motion foundation model with better generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

*Yifan Lu,Ziyun Zou,Belal Alsinglawi,Islam Al-Qudah,Izzat Alsmadi,Feilong Tang,Pengfei Jiao,Shoaib Jameel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear-time, slot-aware heterogeneous graph network (HeSRN) that replaces self-attention with retention-based encoding, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with lower complexity on node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity and struggle to model heterogeneous semantics, limiting scalability and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs.

Method: Propose HeSRN with a slot-aware structure encoder that projects heterogeneous features into independent slots, applies slot normalization and retention-based fusion to disentangle semantics; replace self-attention with a retention-based encoder for linear-time structural/contextual modeling; employ a heterogeneous retentive encoder with multi-scale retention layers to capture local and global semantic signals.

Result: On four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets, HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification, achieving higher accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: HeSRN enables efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning by mitigating semantic entanglement and achieving linear-time complexity without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

### [338] [Scaling Laws and Symmetry, Evidence from Neural Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09768)
*Khang Ngo,Siamak Ravanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equivariant geometric models show stronger scaling with data, parameters, and compute; higher-order representations improve scaling; symmetry biases should be built in rather than learned, as scaling laws depend on architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how inductive biases like symmetry and architecture choices influence scaling behavior in learning interatomic potentials at scale.

Method: Empirical study comparing equivariant and non-equivariant architectures across varying data, model size, and compute; analyzing power-law scaling exponents and the impact of representation order on scaling.

Result: Equivariant architectures outperform non-equivariant ones in scaling; higher-order representations yield better scaling exponents; data and model sizes should scale in tandem for compute-optimal training; symmetry biases influence task difficulty and scaling laws.

Conclusion: Inductive biases such as symmetry should be embedded into models to achieve better scaling and resource efficiency; relying on the model to discover symmetry is suboptimal, especially at scale.

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

### [339] [A Generic Machine Learning Framework for Radio Frequency Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09775)
*Alex Hiles,Bashar I. Ahmad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generic ML-enabled RF fingerprinting framework for Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) and related tasks, leveraging data-driven approaches to extract emitter fingerprints across diverse radiators and transmission schemes; demonstrated on real RF datasets for tasks like SEI, EDA, and RFEC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate and generalize RF fingerprinting by learning intricate, device-specific features from data, overcoming labor-intensive and inflexible traditional methods while enabling robust downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA, RFEC across diverse transmissions.

Method: Proposes a generic machine learning-based framework for RF fingerprinting (RF-FP framework) inclusive of SEI, EDA, RFEC; formulates each task as a fingerprint-dependent problem; validates with real RF datasets across scenarios (spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence, drone countermeasures).

Result: Framework demonstrated across multiple RF tasks on real datasets, illustrating versatility and potential performance gains over traditional approaches (specific metrics not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: ML-enabled RF fingerprinting offers a flexible, task-inclusive approach that can handle various emitter types and transmissions, enabling widespread RF emitter authentication and data association applications.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

### [340] [Why Do Transformers Fail to Forecast Time Series In-Context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09776)
*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Surbhi Goel,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract analyzes why Transformers struggle in time series forecasting (TSF). Under AR(p) data, linear self-attention (LSA) cannot beat classical linear models for in-context forecasting; with infinite context, LSA recovers the optimal linear predictor; with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), predictions collapse to the mean. Empirical experiments validate the theory. The work highlights fundamental theoretical limits of TSF and suggests design considerations for forecasting architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the empirical gap where powerful Transformer-based models often underperform simple linear models in TSF, by providing a theoretical lens via In-Context Learning (ICL) theory.

Method: Theoretical analysis under autoregressive AR(p) data showing limits of Linear Self-Attention (LSA) for in-context forecasting; asymptotic results as context length grows; analysis of CoT-style inference; supplemented by carefully designed experiments to validate the theory.

Result: (1) LSA cannot surpass classical linear models in expected MSE for in-context forecasting; (2) as context length → ∞, LSA approaches the optimal linear predictor; (3) CoT-style inference causes predictions to collapse to the mean exponentially; empirical results support these findings.

Conclusion: The work sheds light on fundamental theoretical limitations of TSF with Transformer architectures, encourages reevaluation of using sophisticated models for TSF without deeper theoretical scrutiny, and informs the design of more effective forecasting architectures.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

### [341] [SVTime: Small Time Series Forecasting Models Informed by "Physics" of Large Vision Model Forecasters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09780)
*ChengAo Shen,Ziming Zhao,Hanghang Tong,Dongjin Song,Dongsheng Luo,Qingsong Wen,Jingchao Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVTime is a compact model that captures the inductive biases of large-vision-model forecasters to achieve long-term time series forecasting performance close to LVMs, with far fewer parameters and lower resource needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sustainability and practicality concerns of using large, energy-intensive models for time series forecasting, especially for resource-constrained users, by designing a lightweight model that retains LVM-like performance.

Method: Identify key inductive biases of LVM forecasters (conceptualized as physics of LTSF) and implement them in a small model using carefully crafted linear layers and constraint functions to encode these biases.

Result: SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight models and rivals large LVMs on 21 baselines across 8 datasets, with 1000x fewer parameters than LVMs and more efficient training/inference.

Conclusion: It is feasible to achieve large-model-like performance in long-term time series forecasting with a compact model by encoding the core inductive biases of large forecasters, enabling sustainable and cost-effective forecasting.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

### [342] [Building a Foundational Guardrail for General Agentic Systems via Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09781)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a three-part approach to pre-execution safety for LLM agents: AuraGen for controllable data synthesis, Safiron as a dual-encoder guardian model with a cross-planner adapter, and Pre-Exec Bench for evaluation; together aiming to close data, model, and evaluation gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails focus on post-execution and scale poorly; pre-execution safety is underexplored and essential to prevent harmful actions before they occur. The paper identifies data, model, and evaluation gaps that hinder robust pre-execution safety.

Method: AuraGen synthesizes benign and risk-labeled trajectories with calibrated difficulty and automated reward-model filtering to create large datasets for pre-execution safety. Safiron combines a cross-planner adapter (unifying input formats) with a compact guardian model to flag risks, categorize risk types, and generate justifications, trained in two stages using a broadly explored data recipe. Pre-Exec Bench provides a diverse benchmark with tools and branching trajectories to assess detection, categorization, explanation, and cross-planner generalization.

Result: Empirical experiments show that the proposed guardrails (AuraGen + Safiron + Pre-Exec Bench) yield consistent improvements over strong baselines on pre-execution safety tasks; ablation studies identify practical guidelines for safer agentic systems and demonstrate robust transfer across settings.

Conclusion: Addresses the data, model, and evaluation gaps for pre-execution safety in LLM agents by delivering a data-generation engine, a guarded planning framework, and a realistic benchmark, offering a practical template for scalable, controllable agent safety.

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

### [343] [Large Language Models for Imbalanced Classification: Diversity makes the difference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09783)
*Dang Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Kien Do,Thin Nguyen,Taylor Braund,Alexis Whitton,Svetha Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LLM-based oversampling framework for imbalanced tabular data that improves diversity of synthetic minority samples by conditioning generation on labels/features, introducing a permutation-based fine-tuning strategy, and training on both real minority and interpolated samples; empirically outperforms 8 SOTA baselines across 10 datasets with entropy-based diversity justification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced classification often relies on resampling; SMOTE-like methods lose information when converting categoricals to numbers. While LLM-based oversampling exists, it tends to produce low-diversity samples, hurting robustness and generalization. There is a need for diverse, realistic minority samples that respect feature-label structure.

Method: 1) A sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample generation on minority labels and features. 2) A permutation strategy to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs. 3) Fine-tuning the LLM on minority samples plus interpolated samples to enrich variability.

Result: Experimental evaluation on 10 tabular datasets shows the method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. Generated samples are realistic and diverse. An entropy-based theoretical analysis demonstrates the method promotes diversity in generated samples.

Conclusion: The approach effectively increases minority-sample diversity and improves downstream classification performance, backed by empirical gains and a theoretical grounding. This suggests strong potential for more robust and generalizable models on imbalanced tabular data, with future work likely exploring broader datasets and refinements to the interpolation strategies.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

*Richard John,Yunrui Qiu,Lukas Herron,Pratyush Tiwary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D-SPIB jointly learns informative molecular representations and performs diffusion-based generation by integrating a time-lagged information bottleneck with a diffusion model, while fusing temperature information from multiple trajectories to model thermodynamics; it shows promise in generalizing to unseen conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular science data are high‑dimensional and expensive to collect, with important events being rare. There is a need to compress data into informative latent manifolds that preserve dynamics for downstream tasks and generation, and to learn thermodynamics across different simulation trajectories.

Method: A joint training objective that combines a time-lagged information bottleneck (SPIB) with a diffusion generative model. This balances representation learning and generative aims in one flexible architecture. The model can incorporate temperature information from various trajectories to learn a coherent thermodynamic representation.

Result: Benchmarking on multiple molecular tasks demonstrates the model’s ability to learn meaningful representations and enable generation, with improved generalization potential—potentially extrapolating to conditions outside the training set.

Conclusion: D-SPIB offers a flexible, unified framework for simultaneous representation learning and diffusion-based generation in molecular sciences, capable of integrating thermodynamic information across trajectories and supporting exploration of unseen physical conditions.

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

### [345] [Principled Operator Learning in Ocean Dynamics: The Role of Temporal Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09792)
*Vahidreza Jahanmard,Ali Ramezani-Kebrya,Robinson Hordoir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal Fourier-mode neural operator (FNOtD) improves high-frequency ocean PDE prediction by entangling space-time and internalizing dispersion; outperforms standard FNO in stability/physical fidelity and is cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address long-term stability and physical consistency in neural operators for high-frequency ocean dynamics; enhance fidelity in high-resolution predictions.

Method: Compare FNO with FNOtD, modify to incorporate temporal Fourier modes and dispersion relation; train kernels with space-time entanglement; evaluate on ocean PDE tasks; assess long-term stability, physical fidelity, and computational cost.

Result: FNOtD substantially improves long-term prediction stability and adherence to physics in high-frequency regimes; competitive with a state-of-the-art numerical ocean model at lower cost.

Conclusion: Entangling space-time in kernel training and encoding dispersion enhances multiscale wave propagation learning; FNOtD is a promising, efficient alternative for high-resolution ocean forecasting.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

### [346] [Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09794)
*Lianghuan Huang,Yingshan Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In vision transformers trained for object counting, decodability and causality diverge: middle-layer object tokens can causally influence outputs while being hard to decode, whereas final-layer tokens are well-decodable but functionally inert. The CLS token likewise shifts from decodable in mid-layers to causally powerful only in later layers, highlighting that what information is present and what is used are separate dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanistic interpretability aims to explain predictions by examining internal representations. The study seeks to disentangle decodability (recoverable information from hidden states) from causality (functional influence on outputs) in ViTs, a key step to revealing hidden computational circuits.

Method: 1) Activation patching: transplanting activations of spatial and CLS tokens across clean and corrupted image pairs to test causal influence. 2) Linear probes: train probes to assess decodability of count information at different network depths.

Result: Systematic mismatches between decodability and causality: middle-layer object tokens show strong causal influence despite weak decodability; final-layer object tokens are well decodable but have little causal effect; CLS token becomes decodable mid-layer but gains causal power only in final layers.

Conclusion: Decodability and causality are complementary dimensions of representation—information present versus information used. Their divergence can reveal hidden computational circuits and guide more precise mechanistic analyses of neural networks.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

### [347] [A Unified Framework for Lifted Training and Inversion Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09796)
*Xiaoyu Wang,Alexandra Valavanis,Azhir Mahmood,Andreas Mang,Martin Benning,Audrey Repetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified lifted training framework incorporating MAC, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training for various architectures, enabling distributed optimization and proximal activations, validated on imaging tasks with improved stability over conventional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome vanishing/exploding gradients, non-smooth activations, and sequential training bottlenecks that hinder parallelization; to exploit lifted formulations and convex tools (Bregman distances) to improve conditioning and enable inverse-problem applications.

Method: Formulates nested optimization as higher-dimensional constrained problem with penalties; unifies architectures under this framework; uses block-coordinate descent (deterministic with acceleration/adaptive methods and implicit SGD); leverages proximal activations and Bregman distances; applies to training and stable inversion of pre-trained networks; includes unrolled networks.

Result: Numerical experiments on standard imaging tasks show lifted Bregman approach achieves better stability and effectiveness than conventional training, notably for proximal activations.

Conclusion: The lifted training framework provides robust, scalable training across architectures and supports inverse problems; it improves conditioning, enables distributed optimization and non-differentiable activations, and is validated on imaging tasks.

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal lifting: a latent-space, monotone time reparameterization that regularizes near-singular flows, preserving conservation laws and yielding globally smooth trajectories; acts as a continuous-time normalization to stabilize physics-informed ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address near-singular, stiff, or turbulent continuous-time dynamical systems and enable stable, invariant-respecting learning in neural models.

Method: Introduce a smooth monotone mapping t → τ(t) (temporal lifting) to lift the dynamics into a latent coordinate where the flow is regularized; apply to incompressible Navier–Stokes on T^3 as an example and position the approach as a time-warp operator for PINNs and latent-flow architectures; link analytic regularity with representation learning for stiff processes.

Result: In lifted coordinates, trajectories become globally smooth; the time-warp operator can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and latent-flow models; the framework connects regularity theory with ML for stiff/turbulent dynamics.

Conclusion: Temporal lifting provides a principled bridge between analytic regularity and data-driven dynamics, offering a robust tool for modeling stiff or turbulent continuous-time systems.

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

### [349] [Decomposer Networks: Deep Component Analysis and Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09825)
*Mohsen Joneidi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder with N parallel branches that factorizes an input into interpretable components using all-but-one residual updates via an unrolled Gauss-Seidel optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain interpretable, multi-component representations beyond a single latent, bridging classical decomposition methods (PCA, NMF) with modern deep and object-centric architectures, and addressing competition and redundancy among latent factors.

Method: Maintain N parallel branches where each branch processes a residual equal to the original input minus reconstructions of the other branches. Unroll a Gauss-Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network to enforce competition among components, situating the approach relative to PCA/NMF, deep unrolled optimization, and MONet/IODINE/Slot Attention; novelty claimed as the first semantic autoencoder with an all-but-one residual update rule.

Result: Yields parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations and demonstrates the integration of competitive, residual-based decomposition within a semantic autoencoding framework, positioning DecompNet among related linear and deep decomposition methods and object-centric architectures.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel semantic autoencoder design that uses all-but-one residual updates to factorize inputs into interpretable components, highlighting its novelty and potential to bridge classical factorization and contemporary object-centric modeling.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

### [350] [An Exploration of Non-Euclidean Gradient Descent: Muon and its Many Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09827)
*Michael Crawshaw,Chirag Modi,Mingrui Liu,Robert M. Gower*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper surveys steepest-descent neural network optimization using layer-wise non-Euclidean norms, introduces Muon variants (including MuonMax), and combines them with model-based momentum (Momo); experiments show MuonMax is more robust to hyperparameters and combining with Momo yields robust, high-performing optimizers, recommended for new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Define and compare non-Euclidean gradient strategies for neural networks by selecting per-layer norms, aggregation across layers, and normalization; extend existing optimizers (Adam, Muon) and develop more robust variants to reduce hyperparameter sensitivity.

Method: Systematically formalize layer-norm aggregations; derive new Muon variants including MuonMax; combine non-Euclidean gradient methods with Momo (model-based momentum); perform comprehensive experimental evaluation of these optimizers within a unified framework.

Result: Muon performance is sensitive to learning rate; MuonMax offers significantly better robustness; Momo-enhanced Muon variants show improved robustness to hyperparameters and often better validation scores.

Conclusion: For new tasks with unknown hyperparameters, use Momo with MuonMax to minimize tuning; the framework enables a spectrum of non-Euclidean gradient methods and robust variants.

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

deep learning. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning for mapping
the near real-time hourly spread of wildfire fronts and smoke plumes using an

the smoke and fire masks generated from different sensing modalities as well as
significant improvement over operational products for the same cases.

### [352] [CALM: A Causal Analysis Language Model for Tabular Data in Complex Systems with Local Scores, Conditional Independence Tests, and Relation Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09846)
*Zhenjiang Fan,Zengyi Qin,Yuanning Zheng,Bo Xiong,Summer Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM is a tabular-data causal discovery model using a Mamba-based architecture that classifies causal patterns from pairwise relationships, achieving 91%+ accuracy in simulations and successfully identifying causal factors in Hepatitis C progression, outperforming PC, causalMGM, and NOTEARS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery from observational tabular data is essential in biology and other fields where controlled experiments are impractical. Existing constraint-based and score-based methods struggle with directionality, linearity assumptions, faithfulness violations, and computational efficiency. LLMs excel at pattern recognition but are ill-suited for tabular causal data, necessitating a specialized model.

Method: Introduce CALM, a causal analysis language model for tabular data with a Mamba-based architecture that classifies causal patterns from pairwise variable relationships. It fuses local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and relational attributes to capture linear, nonlinear, and conditional causality. Training combines synthetic data spans (linear, mixed, nonlinear) and 10 real-world biological datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships. The model is evaluated on simulations and a real-world Hepatitis C progression application.

Result: CALM significantly outperforms existing methods in simulations, reaching over 91% accuracy, and demonstrates practical utility by identifying causal factors in Hepatitis C virus progression.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adapting language-model-style pattern recognition to tabular data enables accurate and generalizable causal discovery, marking a key step toward robust causal analysis in complex systems.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

### [353] [ProxRouter: Proximity-Weighted LLM Query Routing for Improved Robustness to Outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09852)
*Shivam Patel,Neharika Jali,Ankur Mallick,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProxRouter uses exponentially tilted aggregation to make nonparametric LLM routers more robust to outliers, improving outlier routing with minimal overhead while preserving inlier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonparametric routers are training-free and estimate LLM accuracy and cost via similarity to training queries, but they struggle to generalize to outlier queries. Limited training diversity makes expansion costly and keeps pace with evolving use cases. A method that improves robustness without retraining is needed.

Method: Introduce an exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism over the similarity-based estimates used by nonparametric routers. This tilting adjusts the influence of neighboring training queries to balance bias and variance, thereby reducing sensitivity to outliers. Integrate the tilted aggregation into the routing decision process and evaluate against standard baselines.

Result: ProxRouter enhances outlier routing performance while maintaining inlier performance, with minimal computational overhead compared to baseline nonparametric routers.

Conclusion: An efficient, training-free enhancement for nonparametric LLM routers, ProxRouter reduces vulnerability to outliers and can seamlessly replace or augment existing routing strategies in dynamic AI platforms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

### [354] [WARC-Bench: Web Archive Based Benchmark for GUI Subtask Executions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09872)
*Sanjari Srivastava,Gang Li,Cheng Chang,Rishu Garg,Manpreet Kaur,Charlene Y. Lee,Yuezhang Li,Yining Mao,Ignacio Cases,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces WARC-Bench, a 438-task web navigation benchmark using Web ARChive to evaluate subtasks; finds current models struggle on subtasks, with top models reaching up to 64.8% success, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves to 48.8% and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) over SFT pushes to 52.8%, outperforming many frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study short-horizon subtasks within web navigation and provide a sandboxed, realistic benchmark that existing benchmarks under-evaluate. The goal is to measure multimodal agents' ability to perform UI interactions (e.g., date pickers, scrolling) on dynamic webpages.

Method: Create WARC-Bench with 438 tasks that enable sandboxed interactions on dynamic webpages using Web ARChive files. Evaluate multimodal agents. Compare training approaches: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Assess performance under data-scarce conditions and benchmark against frontier models.

Result: WARC-Bench proves challenging for leading models; the highest observed success rate is 64.8% on some tasks. SFT models achieve 48.8% on the benchmark. Applying RLVR on top of SFT checkpoints yields 52.8% accuracy, outperforming many frontier models, even with limited data.

Conclusion: Mastering subtasks is essential for robust web planning and navigation and constitutes a capability not extensively evaluated by existing benchmarks. WARC-Bench provides a focused, realistic platform to study and improve this competence.

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

### [355] [Myopic Bayesian Decision Theory for Batch Active Learning with Partial Batch Label Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09877)
*Kangping Hu,Stephen Mussmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian decision theory (BDT) provides a principled, one-step lookahead framework for active learning, deriving known AL strategies (EER, EPIG, BAIT) and addressing batch-sampling with ParBaLS; empirically, ParBaLS EPIG improves performance at fixed budgets, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are many active learning acquisition functions with unclear guidance on which to use. A universal, principled framework is needed. BDT offers a decision rule to pick the next label that maximizes expected utility under uncertainty.

Method: Derive BDT for the myopic, one-label-to-acquire setting in Bayesian active learning. Show that this yields algorithms such as EER and EPIG; derive BAIT from BDT with asymptotic approximations. Address batch-sampling scalability by formulating a Partial Batch Label Sampling (ParBaLS) for EPIG, and evaluate on neural-embedding features with Bayesian logistic regression.

Result: BDT-based derivations reproduce established AL strategies (EER, EPIG, BAIT). ParBaLS provides a scalable, effective batching approach for EPIG. Empirical tests on several datasets with Bayesian logistic regression on neural embeddings show ParBaLS-EPIG achieves superior performance at fixed labeling budgets; code released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: BDT furnishes a universal, principled framework for Bayesian active learning. It clarifies how several AL methods follow from a single decision-theoretic principle and offers a scalable batching approach (ParBaLS) for EPIG that improves practical performance.

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

### [356] [TAWRMAC: A Novel Dynamic Graph Representation Learning Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09884)
*Soheila Farokhi,Xiaojun Qi,Hamid Karimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAWRMAC is a memory-augmented dynamic GNN that uses Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, memory augmentation, and neighbor co-occurrence embeddings to tackle embedding staleness, lack of neighborhood correlation modeling, and weak structural dynamics capture in evolving graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results in dynamic link prediction and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three main limitations of existing continuous-time dynamic graph learning methods: (1) reliance on node-specific memory leading to embedding staleness; (2) insufficient modeling of correlations between node neighborhoods; (3) poor capture of structural dynamics when link attributes are sparse or absent.

Method: Introduce the TAWRMAC framework that combines Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, memory augmentation via a fixed-time encoding GNN, and explicit neighbor co-occurrence embedding. This setup stabilizes embeddings, enhances contextual awareness, and differentiates repetitive interactions from new connections, supporting strong inductive learning across three negative sampling strategies.

Result: Empirically, TAWRMAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction and node classification on multiple benchmark datasets under both transductive and inductive settings, with robustness across three negative sampling strategies.

Conclusion: TAWRMAC provides stable, generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, advancing the state of the art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning and enabling stronger inductive learning capabilities; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

### [357] [Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888)
*Yunlong Feng,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust nonparametric regression under heavy-tailed noise in RKHS using Huber loss; introduces a probabilistic effective hypothesis space to handle unbounded function classes; derives finite-sample bounds via a bias–variance decomposition and a comparison theorem linking excess robust risk to L2 prediction error (up to an O(sigma^{-2 epsilon}) residual); provides principled tuning rules and extends to other robust losses; emphasizes prediction error as the core performance metric over excess generalization risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address learnability and generalization for robust regression when noise is heavy-tailed and the hypothesis class is potentially unbounded; standard concentration bounds fail under weak moment assumptions, necessitating a metric linked to the target (L2 prediction error).

Method: Huber regression within a Tikhonov-regularized RKHS framework; develop a probabilistic effective hypothesis space to confine the estimator with high probability; establish bias–variance decomposition under weak (1+ε)-moment assumptions; prove comparison theorems that relate excess robust risk to the L2 prediction error up to a residual O(σ^{-2ε}); derive finite-sample error bounds and convergence rates; propose principled tuning rules and extend to other robust losses.

Result: New theoretical connections between excess robust risk and L2 prediction error under heavy-tailed noise; explicit finite-sample bounds and convergence rates for Huber regression in RKHS without assuming uniform boundedness; a framework that supports principled tuning and generalization beyond Huber to other robust losses.

Conclusion: Prediction error in L2 sense should be the fundamental lens for robust learning rather than excess generalization risk; robust estimation with unbounded hypothesis spaces is feasible under weak moment conditions via a probabilistic confinement of the estimator; the results lay groundwork for broader robust loss analyses and practical tuning guidance.

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

### [358] [Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891)
*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Probabilistic error correction for Arctic sea-ice forecasts using a conditional VAE improves calibration and reduces error, enabling large ensembles and better uncertainty quantification over traditional deterministic post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seasonal Arctic sea ice forecasts suffer from systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors; decision-making requires calibrated probabilities and uncertainty, but existing post-processing is largely deterministic and limited by small ensemble sizes.

Method: Train a conditional Variational Autoencoder to learn the conditional distribution P(observations | biased forecast). Use retrospective forecasts to map observations given model outputs, enabling sampling to generate large ensembles. Evaluate using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics.

Result: Adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observed distribution, and exhibit smaller errors than forecasts adjusted by climatological mean.

Conclusion: Probabilistic CVAE-based post-processing provides proper uncertainty quantification and improved predictive skill for Arctic sea ice concentration compared to traditional one-to-one bias corrections.

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

### [359] [Chain-of-Influence: Tracing Interdependencies Across Time and Features in Clinical Predictive Modelings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09895)
*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoI (Chain-of-Influence) is an interpretable deep learning framework for clinical time-series that builds a time-unfolded graph of feature interactions. It uses a two-tier attention scheme—temporal attention to pick key time points and cross-feature attention to model directed influence from those points to later features—enabling tracing of how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction. Evaluated on mortality and disease progression tasks on MIMIC-IV and a private CKD cohort, CoI achieves superior predictive accuracy and provides clinically meaningful, patient-specific insight into temporal and cross-feature dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling clinical time-series data is difficult due to latent, time-varying dependencies between features. Existing methods often rely on opaque black-box components or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly capture how influence propagates through variables over time. There is a need for interpretable models that reveal the propagation of information across time and features to support clinical decision-making.

Method: CoI constructs a time-unfolded graph of feature interactions and employs a two-level attention mechanism. First, a temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient’s record. Second, a cross-feature attention layer models directed influence from features at these time points to subsequent features, enabling tracing of influence pathways from any feature-time to the final prediction. This yields an auditable, granular view of direct and indirect contributions.

Result: Empirically, CoI significantly outperforms existing methods on mortality and disease progression tasks in MIMIC-IV and a private CKD cohort. Beyond accuracy, case studies show CoI uncovers clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease progression that are opaque to other models, offering transparent insights into how temporal and cross-feature dependencies inform predictions.

Conclusion: CoI provides unprecedented transparency into temporal and cross-feature dependencies in clinical time-series, enabling traceable, patient-specific explanations that can inform clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

### [360] [Learning Bug Context for PyTorch-to-JAX Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09898)
*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J is a prompt-augmentation framework to improve LLM-based PyTorch-to-JAX translation by combining curated data, human-in-the-loop fixes, augmented prompts, and novel metrics, achieving higher translation quality and faster execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-framework translation between PyTorch and JAX is nontrivial due to different design choices and data/support gaps, and existing benchmarks are weak or limited in PyTorch→JAX coverage; there is a need for better datasets, prompts, and evaluation tailored to this cross-framework task.

Method: 1) Assemble PyTorch sources (TorchLeet problem-solving set; CodeParrot GitHub set) and generate initial JAX drafts with GPT-4o-mini; 2) have two professional developers iteratively patch drafts to functional equivalence, creating a fixed-bug dataset and patches; 3) construct augmented prompts that encode these fixes to guide lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini); 4) define three PyTorch→JAX-specific metrics: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score, T2J Comparison Score; 5) evaluate improvements and speedups.

Result: LLM-guided translation improved: GPT-4o-mini shows up to 10% higher CodeBLEU, 50% higher FixCost Score (lower cost), 1.33-point increase on CodeTrans Score (0–4), and 100% on Comparison Score; generated code runs up to 2.5× faster than baseline.

Conclusion: T2J demonstrates that prompt augmentation plus curated bug-fix data and task-specific metrics can meaningfully boost PyTorch→JAX translation quality and efficiency for LLM-based pipelines, addressing data scarcity and evaluation gaps in cross-framework benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Placement of LayerNorm in Transformer blocks critically affects training stability; the paper provides theory and bounds for forward activations and backward gradients, analyzes residual scaling, and offers a principled stability framework with empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable; layer normalization placement is often ad-hoc. A principled study of forward and backward stability under different placements is needed to guide design.

Method: Theoretical analysis of forward stability bounds on hidden-state growth and backward stability in backpropagation across LayerNorm placements; analysis of residual scaling; numerical experiments; framework for sanity-checking stability of architectural changes.

Result: Derived explicit bounds on hidden-state growth; clarified how LayerNorm placement affects gradient propagation; provided guidelines for scaling residual steps to improve stability and performance; empirical results corroborate theory.

Conclusion: Offers a principled framework for stability-aware Transformer design, enabling better architectural decisions and proactive sanity-checks for new designs.

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

*Aditya Malusare,Vineet Punyamoorty,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based drug generator augmented with knowledge graph embeddings (K-DREAM) produces molecules with higher target relevance and multi-target potential, outperforming existing models in binding and efficacy predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating structured biomedical knowledge into generative drug design remains underexplored; knowledge graphs could steer generation toward therapeutically meaningful candidates, improving alignment with targets and reducing experimental turnover.

Method: Embed large-scale knowledge graphs into the diffusion-based generative framework, conditioning molecule generation on relational and biomedical context to bias toward biologically relevant chemistries and target-specific profiles.

Result: In targeted design tasks, K-DREAM yields candidates with improved predicted binding affinities and efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models; capable of multi-target design.

Conclusion: Knowledge-driven embeddings augment diffusion models to enable rational, target-aligned drug design with practical therapeutic relevance for complex diseases.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

TL;DR: Smartwatch-based intoxication classification using long-term multi-sensor data; Hyperdimensional Computing offers the best accuracy–efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive alcohol use causes serious health risks and community impacts. There is a need for real-time, scalable interventions delivered via wearables. Prior work relied on limited smartphone motion data and short monitoring periods, leaving a gap for extended, multi-sensor smartwatch data to classify intoxication.

Method: Collected TAC, accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart-rate data from participants over three weeks to classify intoxication levels. Evaluated multiple state-of-the-art classifiers—Transformer, Bi-LSTM, GRU, 1D-CNN, and Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)—and assessed their performance and efficiency on resource-constrained mobile hardware.

Result: Hyperdimensional Computing achieved the best balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency, indicating practicality for smartwatch-based just-in-time intoxication warnings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of extended multi-sensor smartwatch data for intoxication classification and supports the viability of HDC as a practical model for real-world JIT intervention systems on wearables.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe
consequences for both individuals and their communities. To advocate for
healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three
weeks. This is the first study to combine accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart
rate smartwatch data collected over an extended monitoring period to classify
intoxication levels. Previous research had used limited smartphone motion data
and conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking
episodes; in this work, we use smartwatch data and perform a thorough
evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer,
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional
Computing (HDC). We have compared performance metrics for the algorithms and
assessed their efficiency on resource-constrained environments like mobile
hardware. The HDC model achieved the best balance between accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for smartwatch-based applications.

### [364] [AutoGD: Automatic Learning Rate Selection for Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09923)
*Nikola Surjanovic,Alexandre Bouchard-Côté,Trevor Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoGD automatically adapts the learning rate in gradient descent by deciding when to increase or decrease the step size at each iteration, achieving near-optimal GD rates without knowledge of smoothness constants; it is proven to converge and shows strong empirical performance; extensions AutoBFGS/AutoLBFGS are also effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuning the learning rate is critical for gradient-based optimization and can be impractical, especially when gradient methods are inner loops in larger algorithms. An automatic method reduces human effort and improves robustness.

Method: Introduce AutoGD, a gradient descent variant that autonomously determines the direction of learning-rate adjustment at each iteration. The paper provides a convergence proof, shows recovery of the optimal GD rate up to a constant without smoothness constants, and demonstrates empirical performance on traditional problems and variational inference tasks. Extensions AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS are also proposed and evaluated.

Result: Convergence of AutoGD is established. The method can recover the optimal rate of GD up to a constant without requiring explicit smoothness constants. Empirical experiments demonstrate strong performance across a range of problems and tasks, including variational inference, and support the effectiveness of the AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS extensions.

Conclusion: AutoGD offers automatic learning-rate adaptation with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance, reducing tuning burden for gradient-based optimization. The approach extends to quasi-Newton variants (AutoBFGS/AutoLBFGS), broadening applicability.

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

### [365] [Phase-Aware Deep Learning with Complex-Valued CNNs for Audio Signal Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09926)
*Naman Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Complex-valued CNNs (CVCNNs) are studied for audio to preserve phase information, showing promise via three-stage evaluation: competitive image benchmarks, modest MFCC-based audio gains, and phase-aware gains using GNNs; overall suggests phase is a meaningful, exploitable feature, though architecture needs further phase-aware design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase information is often discarded by real-valued networks even though it carries important cues for audio processing. This work motivates systematic development of complex-valued architectures with stable training to unlock phase advantages across tasks.

Method: Introduce complex-valued layers (convolutions, pooling) and Wirtinger-based differentiation, plus complex batch normalization and initialization. Evaluate in three stages: (1) image benchmarks with complex perturbations to establish baseline and stability; (2) audio classification using MFCCs, comparing CVCNNs against real CNNs; (3) use GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, analyzing gains in binary and multi-class genre classification. Mention cardioid activation as a notable option.

Result: On images, CVCNNs are competitive with real-valued CNNs and robust to synthetic complex perturbations. On MFCC-based audio, CVCNNs slightly outperform real CNNs, though exploiting phase in input remains challenging without architectural changes. Incorporating phase through GNN-based edge weighting yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class genre classification.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the expressive potential of complex-valued architectures and confirm that phase is a meaningful, exploitable feature in audio processing. However, current methods still face challenges in fully leveraging phase, and future phase-aware designs (beyond existing activations like cardioid) are needed to realize the full potential of complex representations.

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

### [366] [MemPromptTSS: Persistent Prompt Memory for Iterative Multi-Granularity Time Series State Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09930)
*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Chiao-Tung Chan,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS introduces persistent memory to prompt-guided multi-granularity time series segmentation, enabling prompts to influence predictions across the entire sequence and iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that existing time-series prompts operate only within local contexts, hindering cross-sequence guidance and iterative refinement across granularities.

Method: A memory encoder converts prompts and local subsequences into memory tokens stored in a bank. Predictions condition on both local cues and all previously accumulated prompts, enabling iterative, multi-granularity segmentation with persistent memory.

Result: Evaluated on six datasets from wearable sensing and industrial monitoring, MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy improvements over the best baseline in single-iteration single- and multi-granularity segmentation, respectively. In iterative inference, average per-iteration gains are 2.66 percentage points versus 1.19 for a prior prompt-based method.

Conclusion: Persistent memory is crucial for effective prompt-guided segmentation; MemPromptTSS is practical and improves real-world performance across granularities and iterations.

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

### [367] [Conformal Sparsification for Bandwidth-Efficient Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09942)
*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Meiyu Zhong,Guangyi Zhang,Osvaldo Simeone,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Edge-cloud speculative decoding compresses draft token distributions to reduce edge-cloud bandwidth. The paper introduces an information-theoretic bound on token rejection, then proposes the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD) with structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Two variants—K-SQS (fixed top-K) and C-SQS (adaptive via online conformal prediction)—achieve lower latency and improved rejection rates across regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The edge-cloud bottleneck is limited bandwidth for transferring draft token distributions in speculative decoding. To address this, the work derives an information-theoretic bound that separates token rejection into SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and quantization distortion, and uses this insight to design efficient compression schemes.

Method: Derive an information-theoretic bound on token rejection rate decomposing contributions from model distribution mismatch and quantization distortion. Propose Sparse Quantize-and-Sample SD (SQS-SD) framework leveraging distributional sparsity via structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. K-SQS uses fixed top-K truncation; C-SQS adaptively retains tokens using online conformal prediction to bound deviation from dense distribution.

Result: Empirical results show that both K-SQS and C-SQS improve end-to-end latency and token rejection rates, operating effectively in complementary regimes.

Conclusion: Exploiting sparsity and adaptive token selection in edge-cloud speculative decoding yields simultaneous gains in latency and rejection-rate performance, with two practical variants covering different operating regimes.

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

*Jun Yin,Runcheng Cai,Shiliang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CRG_IMSC for incomplete multi-view spectral clustering that directly yields clustering results via nonnegative feature constraints and connectivity-guided self-representation; provides a convergent multiplicative-update algorithm and shows superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two main drawbacks of existing incomplete multi-view spectral clustering: (1) reliance on K-means after feature extraction, which can be sensitive and suboptimal, and (2) underutilization of the sample connectivity information in the clustering process.

Method: Impose nonnegative constraints on the extracted features to yield direct clustering results, construct a connectivity matrix from the spectral clustering result, and minimize the self-representation residual with respect to this connectivity. Propose a novel iterative multiplicative-update algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem and prove its convergence.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark multi-view datasets shows CRG_IMSC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods; the proposed algorithm converges in practice as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC effectively integrates clustering guidance into the spectral framework by leveraging a connectivity-informed self-representation term and a nonnegative feature constraint, yielding improved accuracy and reliable convergence in incomplete multi-view settings.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

TL;DR: A homomorphism-based abstraction framework for MDPs that aims to preserve optimal policy equivalence; presents HPG and EBHPG with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation against seven algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational complexity in solving MDPs via state aggregation while preserving performance; define optimal policy equivalence and analyze when it holds or fails.

Method: Formalize a homomorphism as a linear relationship between value functions of two Markov chains; derive a sufficient condition for optimal policy equivalence; derive bounds on approximation error when the condition is not met; propose Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG) and its Error-Bounded extension (EBHPG).

Result: Theoretical results establishing the sufficient condition and error bounds; empirical validation validating the theory and comparing performance against seven algorithms.

Conclusion: HPG guarantees optimal policy equivalence under the sufficient condition; EBHPG offers a trade-off between computational efficiency and performance loss; framework provides practical approaches for policy optimization in aggregated MDPs.

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

### [370] [Reinforcement Fine-Tuning of Flow-Matching Policies for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09976)
*Mingyang Lyu,Yinqian Sun,Erliang Lin,Huangrui Li,Ruolin Chen,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) approach for online RL fine-tuning of flow-matching Vision-Language-Action models, addressing importance sampling via per-sample objective changes and introducing structure-aware credit assignment, clipped objectives, latent exploration, and a Q-ensemble; shows empirical gains on LIBERO and ALOHA against various baselines and ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs generalize well with large supervised data but are bounded by data quality/coverage. RL promises improvement via online interaction, yet standard policy gradients are infeasible for flow-matching models due to intractable importance sampling, necessitating scalable online RL methods.

Method: Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) reformulates importance sampling by exploiting per-sample changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. It also introduces structure-aware credit assignment to improve gradient efficiency, clipped surrogate objectives for stability, multi-step latent exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble for robust value estimation. The approach enables online RL fine-tuning of the pi0 model and is evaluated on LIBERO and ALOHA, compared against supervised, preference-aligned, diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and pi0-FAST baselines, with ablations.

Result: FPO achieves consistent improvements over the imitation prior and competitive performance against strong baselines, including stable learning under sparse rewards. Ablation studies and analyses of latent space dynamics corroborate the effectiveness of individual components and show stable convergence of the conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Conclusion: FPO makes online RL fine-tuning of flow-matching VLAs feasible and effective, delivering performance gains and stable optimization. It demonstrates a viable pathway for improving VLA systems via online interaction without prohibitive computation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

*Frida Cantu,Salomon Ibarra,Arturo Gonzales,Jesus Barreda,Chenang Liu,Li Zhang*

TL;DR: Matrix profile-based unsupervised anomaly detection for online sensing in additive manufacturing, enabling semantic segmentation to locate onset of defects without heavy reliance on labeled data, validated on real-world sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to detect subtle, semantically meaningful anomalies in high-resolution sensor time series for online manufacturing monitoring, without requiring extensive labeled data, and to identify when new regimes or defect-onset occurs.

Method: Proposes a matrix-profile-based unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that measures fabrication cycle similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing.

Result: Experiments on real-world sensor data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting onset of defects and capturing semantic changes during fabrication.

Conclusion: An unsupervised, matrix-profile-based approach can effectively monitor additive manufacturing processes by detecting subtle, semantic anomalies and segmenting defect onset without relying on labeled data.

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

### [372] [Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984)
*Kartikeya Aneja,Nagender Aneja,Murat Kantarcioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeminiNet learns joint embeddings from two software-graph views—Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs)—using dual GCN branches with adaptive gating, showing superior performance over single-graph models on a dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious, 317 benign).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software systems can be represented by multiple graph types (static function calls vs dynamic process interactions); jointly modeling these complementary perspectives can yield richer embeddings and improve downstream tasks like malware detection or behavior analysis.

Method: Construct FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox; GeminiNet uses two graph convolutional branches to process each graph type, coupled with an adaptive gating mechanism to balance static and dynamic views; trained on a dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious, 317 benign).

Result: Joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model, demonstrating the benefit of integrating static and dynamic graph views in a unified representation.

Conclusion: Multi-view learning with GeminiNet provides enhanced software behavior representations and improves decision quality when comparing malicious vs benign software, highlighting the value of jointly modeling multiple graph perspectives.

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Motivation: Existing WDRO methods relying on global Lipschitz or strong duality often produce loose bounds or be computationally prohibitive; there is a need for tighter, tractable robustness certificates and more flexible worst-case distribution construction.

Method: Develop a primal WDRO approach using exact Lipschitz certificates; introduce a Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs the worst-case distribution; leverage the piecewise-affine structure of ReLU networks on activation cells to achieve an exact tractable WDRO formulation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows competitive robust accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines and tighter certificates than existing WDRO methods; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of primal WDRO with exact Lipschitz certificates and WDA provides tighter guarantees and practical tractability, enabling more flexible adversarial modeling under Wasserstein DRO.

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

*Jiahui Hong,Siqing Li,Muqing Jian,Luming Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified end-to-end EEG classifier (BITE) using aligned time-frequency streams, pyramid attention, and bidirectional convolutions to boost cross-paradigm generalization and MI/SSVEP performance; achieves state-of-the-art across four datasets; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust cross-paradigm EEG recognition amid dataset-specific constraints and substantial inter-subject variability; paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is crucial for reliable BCI systems.

Method: Introduce BITE with (1) aligned STFT-based time-frequency streams for bidirectional modeling, (2) pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA) for multi-scale feature enhancement, (3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward neural dynamics. Evaluated end-to-end on four paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B, HGD, SD-SSVEP) with within-subject and cross-subject tests; designed for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across four divergent EEG paradigms; strong within-subject accuracy and cross-subject generalization; unified MI and SSVEP handling with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential for reliable BCI systems. BITE provides a robust, unified architecture for EEG recognition; code released at GitHub.

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

### [375] [Skill-Targeted Adaptive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10023)
*Yinghui He,Abhishek Panigrahi,Yong Lin,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce STAT, a skill-targeted fine-tuning framework where a stronger LLM identifies missing skills per data point and guides adaptive training (reweighting or synthetic data). It yields notable gains on MATH and OOD benchmarks and complements RL with GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome saturation of vanilla supervised fine-tuning on data similar to training distribution by diagnosing and addressing skill gaps using an LLM's metacognitive abilities; improve generalization, including out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Teacher-LM analyzes the dataset to enumerate task-required skills and labels examples with these skills; monitor student responses to form a Missing-Skill-Profile; STAT-Sel reweights existing training examples by skill gaps; STAT-Syn generates new examples that target missing skills; experiments on Llama and Qwen; results show compatibility with GRPO.

Result: Achieves up to 7.5 percentage-point gains on MATH and about 4.6% average improvement on OOD benchmarks; STAT is complementary to RL via GRPO; code released.

Conclusion: Skill-targeted adaptive training can broadly improve SFT pipelines by addressing explicit skill gaps, offering a practical path to better performance and generalization.

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

*Yang Li,Ruichen Zhang,Yinqiu Liu,Guangyuan Liu,Dusit Niyato,Abbas Jamalipour,Xianbin Wang,Dong In Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A UAV-enabled Low-Altitude Economy Network (LAENet) system that uses onboard vision-language models for real-time multimodal inference, with a hierarchical optimization framework (ARPO and LLaRA) to balance task latency, power consumption, and accuracy under dynamic network conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate, efficient real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained UAVs in LAENets, addressing the trade-off between inference accuracy and communication efficiency amid mobility and varying link conditions.

Method: Develop a UAV-LAENet system model capturing UAV mobility, user-UAV communications, and VQA pipeline; formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization to minimize latency and energy under user-specific accuracy constraints; solve via a two-component framework: ARPO for resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and LLaRA (LLM-augmented RL) for adaptive UAV trajectory optimization, where the LLM offline-refines the RL reward design to avoid extra real-time latency.

Result: Numerical results indicate improved inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical framework effectively improves latency and power efficiency while maintaining accuracy; LLM-assisted offline reward shaping enhances RL-based trajectory optimization without adding real-time latency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

*Ruoxing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPOPT is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a pretrained middle neural network to boost PPO's training efficiency and stability on small-sample physics tasks, achieving better rewards and stability than PPO, but slower than model-based methods like DYNA DDPG; it is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sample-inefficiency in RL for physics-based environments by leveraging transfer learning from a pretraining environment with similar physics to improve learning efficiency and stability.

Method: Introduce PPOPT, a PPO-based algorithm with a neural network architecture that places a pretrained middle section between two fully-connected networks. Pretrain the middle section on a different environment with similar physics, then train the full network with PPO updates in the target environment.

Result: PPOPT outperforms classic PPO on small training samples in both rewards and training stability. It underperforms compared to model-based methods like DYNA DDPG, but being model-free, it requires significantly less training time than those counterparts.

Conclusion: PPOPT provides improved sample efficiency and stability for physics-based tasks in a model-free setting by leveraging a pretrained network component, offering faster training times than model-based approaches and an open-source implementation.

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sample-sensitive, four-stage curriculum (FOSSIL) for medical imaging that balances training emphasis by sample difficulty; enhances AUC, calibration, and robustness in Mpox skin lesion diagnosis using CNN/Transformer models without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small, imbalanced biomedical datasets hamper optimization and generalization. There is a need for data-efficient, interpretable learning that does not rely on metadata or synthetic augmentation.

Method: FOSSIL uses softmax-based uncertainty to quantify difficulty, constructs a four-stage Easy–Very Hard curriculum, and applies a regret-minimizing weighting scheme integrated into CNN and transformer architectures for Mpox lesion classification.

Result: Across settings, FOSSIL improves discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness to real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation.

Conclusion: FOSSIL is a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

### [379] [One4Many-StablePacker: An Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the 3D Bin Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10057)
*Lei Gao,Shihong Huang,Shengjie Wang,Hong Ma,Feng Zhang,Hengda Bao,Qichang Chen,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep RL framework (O4M-SP) for 3D-BPP that generalizes across multiple bin dimensions within a single training run, incorporating stability constraints. It uses a weighted reward (loading rate + height-difference for flatter layouts) and a clipped policy gradient with policy drifting to sustain exploration, yielding strong generalization and superior performance over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of stability-related constraints and poor generalization across diverse bin dimensions in existing learning-based 3D-BPP approaches.

Method: Propose One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP), a deep reinforcement learning framework trained across varying bin dimensions in a single process. The training uses (1) a weighted reward combining loading rate and a height-difference metric to promote flatter, more stable layouts, and (2) a clipped policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting mechanism to prevent entropy collapse and encourage exploration at key packing decisions.

Result: O4M-SP generalizes well across diverse bin dimensions and significantly outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating strong practical applicability for stability-constrained packing.

Conclusion: O4M-SP provides an effective, generalizable, and practically applicable solution for stability-aware 3D-BPP, addressing both dimension variability and stability constraints in packing.

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

*Kanishkha Jaisankar,Sunidhi Tandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Align2Act transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable, human-aligned planners for autonomous driving by enforcing structured reasoning and rationale generation, achieving strong open-loop and competitive closed-loop performance on nuPlan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap where LLM-based planning may not reflect human driving logic or provide interpretable, safe decisions. Create a framework that yields human-like reasoning and traceable trajectories for autonomous driving.

Method: Derive structured driving instructions (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and use Align2ActChain for step-by-step reasoning to produce both an interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. Fine-tune LLaMA-2-7B via LoRA on ~1M nuPlan scenarios; evaluate open-loop and closed-loop performance on Test14-random.

Result: The approach delivers an open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and 66.96 (reactive), with improved planning quality and human-likeness on the nuPlan closed-loop benchmark; ablations show structured reasoning boosts performance over baseline LLM planners.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning-enabled LLM planners like Align2Act can align decision-making with human driving logic and deliver interpretable, safe motion plans in real-world benchmarks, offering a path beyond purely synthetic or non-interpretable planning.

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

*Hehe Fan,Yi Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Translution unifies adaptive element identification (self-attention) with relative encoding (convolution) and introduces a lightweight variant, α-Translution. It outperforms self-attention on computer vision and natural language processing tasks; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention learns structure via absolute positional embeddings but can be parameter-heavy and data-hungry; convolution encodes elements relatively but fixed kernel sizes limit adaptivity. The goal is a unified operation that combines adaptive identification with relative encoding while keeping parameters manageable.

Method: Define Translution as a fusion of adaptive element identification and relative encoding. Develop α-Translution, a lightweight variant with reduced parameter count. Validate on computer vision and natural language processing tasks, comparing against self-attention baselines. Provide source code.

Result: Translution (and α-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention baselines on the tested CV and NLP tasks. The lightweight variant maintains performance with a substantially lower parameter count.

Conclusion: Translution offers a new, unified approach that leverages the strengths of self-attention and convolution. The α-Translution variant makes the approach practical by reducing parameters, and the approach is demonstrated across vision and language tasks, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.

*Jinyang Zhang,Yue Fang,Hongxin Ding,Weibin Liao,Muyang Ye,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADEPT: a two-stage, function-aware CPT method that selectively expands layers and performs unit-wise, decoupled tuning to improve domain adaptation with minimal parameter updates and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional continual pretraining suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain capacity. By recognizing functional specialization in LLMs, the method aims to expand and tune selectively to minimize interference between general and domain-specific knowledge.

Method: Stage 1: General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion—duplicate layers least critical for the general domain to boost capacity with minimal interference. Stage 2: Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning—within expanded layers, disentangle parameter units by general-domain importance and apply asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and retention.

Result: ADEPT outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58% on the target domain, using only 15% of parameters tuned and with less than 50% of the training time.

Conclusion: Targeted, function-aware expansion and decoupled optimization are necessary for efficient and robust domain-adaptive CPT. The approach provides new principles for efficient adaptation, with open-source code available.

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

*Salomon Ibarra,Frida Cantu,Kaixiong Zhou,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces point-based shortcut learning in time-series classification, proposes a testable detection method that relies on other classes rather than test data or clean labels, and validates on UCR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs in time-series classification (TSC) rely on spurious correlations, harming generalization; shortcut behavior in time series is under-explored and prior work often relies on external attributes; study internal biases and develop detection methods.

Method: Define point-based shortcut learning in TSC and present a simple detection approach using information from other classes that does not require test data or clean training classes.

Result: Applied the detection method to UCR datasets, demonstrating feasibility of detecting point-based shortcuts; results support the existence of shortcut learning and the utility of the proposed detector.

Conclusion: This work begins the study of point-based shortcut learning in deep TSC, introduces a data-efficient detector, and suggests directions for mitigating shortcuts in time-series models.

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

### [384] [What Makes Looped Transformers Perform Better Than Non-Recursive Ones (Provably)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10089)
*Zixuan Gong,Jiaye Teng,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Looped-attention models outperform standard transformers due to an inductive bias embedded in a loss-landscape geometry. By extending a River–Valley landscape to include flat (River-U) and steep (River-V) valleys, the recursive Looped-Attn is hypothesized to prefer River-V valleys, enabling faster convergence through valley hopping and better learning of complex patterns. A staged hierarchical training framework (SHIFT) is proposed to accelerate training of Looped-Attn while matching performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical grounding for the empirical advantage of looped transformers is lacking. The paper seeks to connect architecture-induced dynamics (sample and Hessian behavior) to loss-landscape geometry, offering a principled explanation for when and why Looped-Attn helps on complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Extend the River–Valley landscape model by distinguishing flat (U-shaped) valleys and steep (V-shaped) valleys. Propose a conjectured inductive bias that Looped-Attn steers optimization toward River-V-Valleys. Provide theoretical derivations showing improved convergence along river paths via valley hopping and enhanced learning of complex patterns. Introduce SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical Framework for Progressive Training) to accelerate Looped-Attn training while retaining performance.

Result: Theoretical results indicate better loss convergence along River–Valley paths due to valley hopping and enhanced learning of complex patterns under the Looped-Attn bias. SHIFT is proposed as a practical training framework to speed up training without sacrificing accuracy, enabling comparable performance to standard approaches with less training time.

Conclusion: Looped attention's practical advantage can be rooted in loss-landscape geometry; a staged training approach (SHIFT) can realize efficient training while preserving or matching the performance gains, justifying the architectural choice for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

### [385] [Context-Aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11501)
*Emran Yasser Moustafa,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Context-aware model-based RL with cMask improves generalization to unseen adversary behaviors in autonomous racing; shows better out-of-distribution generalization and superior performance against in-distribution adversaries compared to other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving demands robust generalization and safety. Model-based RL is data-efficient but sensitive to environment/transition changes. There is a need for methods that generalize to unseen contexts, including adversarial behaviors, in safety-critical driving tasks.

Method: Frame the racing task as contextual Markov decision processes. Parameterize adversary behavior using the episode context, thereby conditioning the transition and reward dynamics. Propose cMask, a context-aware extension of existing MBRL approaches. Benchmark in Roboracer (F1Tenth) against context-free and other context-aware baselines.

Result: Context-aware MBRL generalizes better to out-of-distribution adversary behaviors. cMask shows strong generalization and further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Conclusion: Incorporating context into MBRL improves generalization in safety-critical autonomous driving tasks; cMask is an effective context-aware extension with strong performance across both out-of-distribution and in-distribution adversarial settings.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

### [386] [Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101)
*Martin Carrasco,Caio Deberaldini Netto,Vahan A. Martirosyan,Aneeqa Mehrab,Ehimare Okoyomon,Caterina Graziani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Increasing GNN expressivity via WL colorings increases the number of equivalence classes, which raises Rademacher complexity and weakens generalization; the framework shows stability to sampling perturbations and extends beyond 1-WL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain the observed trade-off between expressivity and generalization in GNNs by linking expressivity to dataset-dependent complexity through WL colorings and Rademacher complexity.

Method: Theoretical analysis deriving bounds: the number of WL-induced equivalence classes bounds Rademacher complexity; show stability of this complexity under perturbations of color counts across samples; generalization results extend to arbitrary GNN architectures and color-based partitions.

Result: Greater expressivity yields higher Rademacher complexity and weaker generalization guarantees; Rademacher complexity is stable to sampling variability; the framework unifies expressivity and generalization across GNNs.

Conclusion: This framework explains the trade-off and provides principled understanding; applicability beyond MP-GNNs and 1-WL; guides design of GNNs balancing expressivity and generalization.

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

### [387] [PANTHER: Generative Pretraining Beyond Language for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10102)
*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid generative–discriminative framework (PANTHER) for scalable sequential user behavior modeling that pretrains on unlabeled behavior data and adapts for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between LLM-style pretraining on text and modeling high-cardinality, multi-attribute user behavior sequences; enable transferable, real-time representations from unlabeled data for tasks like next-transaction prediction and fraud detection.

Method: Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional attributes into a discrete vocabulary; Sequence Pattern Recognition Module (SPRM) to model periodic motifs; Unified User-Profile Embedding combining static demographics with dynamic histories; offline embedding caching to enable millisecond online inference.

Result: Deployed at WeChat Pay with a 25.6% lift in HitRate@1 for next-transaction prediction and a 38.6% relative improvement in fraud-detection recall over baselines; public benchmarks show up to 21% HitRate@1 gains over transformer baselines.

Conclusion: PANTHER demonstrates scalable, high-performance sequential user representation learning by unifying pretraining and downstream adaptation, with strong industrial deployment and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

### [388] [Lighter-X: An Efficient and Plug-and-play Strategy for Graph-based Recommendation through Decoupled Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10105)
*Yanping Zheng,Zhewei Wei,Frank de Hoog,Xu Chen,Hongteng Xu,Yuhang Ye,Jiadeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X compresses GNN-based recommender models to dramatically reduce parameter count and computation while preserving performance, enabling scalable deployment. It achieves parameter complexity O(h × d) with h ≪ n by compressing sparse adjacency and high-dimensional embeddings, and uses a decoupled training framework; on large graphs, it attains comparable or better results with only 1% of LightGCN parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN-based recommender systems (e.g., LightGCN) suffer from high parameter and memory costs due to per-node embeddings, hindering deployment on large-scale graphs. There's a need to reduce model size and compute while maintaining performance and guarantees.

Method: Propose Lighter-X, a modular compression framework that identifies redundancy in original GNN parameters and applies a sparse-adjacency and embedding matrix compression scheme to achieve parameter complexity O(h × d) (with h ≪ n). It also introduces a decoupled training paradigm to cut training-time computations. The framework is designed to plug into existing GNN-based recommender architectures without changing their core modeling ambitions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Lighter-X matches the performance of baseline models with significantly fewer parameters. On large-scale graphs with millions of edges, it can achieve even better results using only about 1% of the parameters used by LightGCN.

Conclusion: Lighter-X offers a scalable, practical solution for deploying GNN-based recommender systems by drastically reducing parameter size and computation while preserving accuracy, and it can be integrated with existing architectures to enable efficient large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

### [389] [Preference-driven Knowledge Distillation for Few-shot Node Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10116)
*Xing Wei,Chunchun Chen,Rui Fan,Xiaofeng Cao,Sourav Medya,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-distillation framework, PKD, unites LLMs and multiple GNNs for few-shot node classification on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) by two personalized distillation mechanisms: (i) a GNN-preference-driven node selector that guides LLM-to-teacher distillation to GNN teachers, and (ii) a node-preference-driven GNN selector that picks the best teacher per node for tailored distillation to a student GNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs rely on labeled data and struggle with diverse local topologies in real-world TAGs; LLMs excel at zero-/few-shot reasoning but are not scalable for large graphs. Combining both can leverage cheap, broad knowledge from LLMs and specialized graph-structural reasoning from GNNs to improve few-shot node classification.

Method: Propose the PKD framework with two components: (1) a GNN-preference-driven node selector that promotes distillation from LLMs to teacher GNNs for node-level predictions, and (2) a node-preference-driven GNN selector that assigns the most suitable teacher GNN per node to enable tailored knowledge distillation to a student GNN. The approach integrates LLM-derived signals and multiple GNN teachers to perform few-shot node classification on TAGs, with experiments on real-world datasets to assess performance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PKD for few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs, showing improved performance over baselines by leveraging both LLMs and multiple GNN teachers through targeted distillation.

Conclusion: PKD provides a principled way to synergize LLMs and diverse GNNs for few-shot node classification on TAGs. The selective, per-node and per-teacher distillation mechanisms help address label scarcity and topological heterogeneity, though practical considerations include prompting design, computational costs, and the robustness of selectors.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

### [390] [CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10129)
*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip accelerates RAG inference by selective KV cache recomputation guided by a small auxiliary LLM, using shared prefixes and grouping to preserve inter-chunk attention, achieving near full-attention quality with up to 1.92x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems suffer from long TTFT due to long input sequences and trade-offs in existing KV-cache methods. There is a need for robust, high-quality cross-chunk reasoning without sacrificing efficiency.

Method: Three techniques: (1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache recomputation with a finetuned auxiliary model for better selection accuracy; (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks; (3) grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.

Result: CacheClip retains 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2% and 35.1% on NIAH (reomp% = 20%). Inference speedup up to 1.92x in prefill time.

Conclusion: CacheClip provides an efficient solution to the efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG, enabling robust cross-chunk reasoning with high generation quality and significantly faster inference.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

### [391] [PermLLM: Learnable Channel Permutation for N:M Sparse Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10136)
*Lancheng Zou,Shuo Yin,Zehua Pei,Tsung-Yi Ho,Farzan Farnia,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learnable channel permutation framework (PermLLM) for N:M sparse models. It uses differentiable soft permutations via Sinkhorn, a block-wise strategy to reduce parameters, and integrates with one-shot pruning to adapt channel order for better accuracy on large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional channel permutation relies on handcrafted quality metrics that poorly reflect pruning impact, leading to suboptimal channel reordering and performance loss. There is a need for differentiable, adaptive permutation methods that directly optimize for pruning outcomes.

Method: Introduce learnable channel permutation (LCP) with Sinkhorn normalization to convert permutation matrices into differentiable soft permutations, enabling end-to-end optimization. Implement a block-wise channel permutation strategy to lower parameter count and computation. Combine with existing one-shot pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel order under N:M sparsity during post-training pruning.

Result: Empirical evaluation on LLaMA, Qwen, and OPT shows PermLLM achieves superior performance in optimizing N:M sparse models compared to baseline channel-permutation methods. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: PermLLM provides an effective, efficient approach to mitigating pruning-induced errors in N:M sparse models by learning channel permutations, and can be integrated with existing pruning pipelines to boost sparse-model accuracy.

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

### [392] [Adversarial Attacks on Downstream Weather Forecasting Models: Application to Tropical Cyclone Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10140)
*Yue Deng,Francisco Santos,Pang-Ning Tan,Lifeng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cyc-Attack enables gradient-based adversarial perturbations of upstream weather forecasts to steer TC trajectories, addressing black-box detector, data imbalance, and physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning based weather forecasting models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that can alter downstream tropical cyclone trajectory predictions. Challenges include: (1) TC detectors are opaque and non-differentiable, hindering gradient-based attacks; (2) extreme rarity of TC events causes severe class imbalance, complicating targeted attack generation; (3) perturbations must preserve physical realism to be plausible.

Method: Train a differentiable surrogate to approximate the detector output to enable gradient-based attacks. Use a skewness-aware loss with a kernel dilation strategy to mitigate imbalance. Apply a distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization to constrain perturbations, ensuring adversarial forecasts remain realistic and not easily detectable.

Result: The proposed Cyc-Attack can generate adversarial upstream forecasts that steer downstream TC trajectories toward attacker-specified targets, overcoming black-box and imbalance challenges while preserving physical plausibility.

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack demonstrates a practical vulnerability of DLWF-based TC forecasting to adversarial perturbations and motivates the development of robust defenses; it provides a concrete framework for future defense research and evaluation.

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIRE is a frequency-domain, interpretable framework for time series forecasting that decomposes signals into amplitude and phase, learns adaptive frequency weights, uses a targeted loss, and a sparse-data training paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art long-term forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting models rely on black-box neural architectures and struggle with interpretability and distributional shifts across time and frequency. A unified, interpretable framework is needed to understand and robustly forecast diverse time series.

Method: FIRE performs independent modeling of amplitude and phase in the frequency domain, adaptively learns weights for frequency basis components, employs a targeted loss function tailored for forecasting tasks, and introduces a training paradigm designed for sparse data.

Result: Across benchmarks, FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on long-term forecasting and significantly enhances interpretability of the forecasts.

Conclusion: FIRE provides a unified, interpretable, and robust approach to time series forecasting by leveraging frequency-domain decomposition, enabling better generalization and insight into the dynamics of time series across domains.

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust conditional diffusion framework that learns pseudo conditioning via temporal ensembling and uses Reverse-time Diffusion Condition (RDC) to handle extremely noisy conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art results on class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy tasks when conditioning is corrupted.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditional diffusion models degrade notably under noisy conditioning (e.g., corrupted labels or unreliable observations). Existing noise-robust methods fail at high noise levels, motivating techniques that can infer and refine clean conditioning signals.

Method: 1) Learn pseudo conditions as surrogates for clean conditions. 2) Refine pseudo conditions progressively with temporal ensembling. 3) Introduce Reverse-time Diffusion Condition (RDC) to diffuse pseudo conditions, reinforcing memorization and aiding refinement. 4) Apply to class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy generation; provide code at the project page.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art performance across a spectrum of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and visuomotor policy generation tasks; demonstrates robustness to extremely noisy conditioning.

Conclusion: The proposed pseudo-conditioning framework with temporal ensembling and RDC offers a robust solution for conditioning diffusion models under severe noise, improving performance and broadening applicability to tasks with unreliable conditioning signals.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes STEER, a token-level entropy-change-aware reweighting method, to prevent entropy collapse in RLVR for LLMs, improving entropy stability and math-reasoning performance beyond existing entropy interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy collapse in RLVR causes rapid loss of policy diversity and poor generalization; existing entropy-intervention methods offer indirect, limited control. A deeper, token-level understanding of entropy dynamics is needed to design more robust interventions.

Method: Quantitatively analyzes token-level entropy changes, shows limitations of current entropy-intervention methods, and introduces STEER (Stabilizing Token-level Entropy-changE via Reweighting), an entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme with fine-grained token-level adjustments to stabilize entropy dynamics during training.

Result: STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes entropy dynamics, and improves downstream performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating robustness across tasks; code is provided.

Conclusion: Directly addressing entropy dynamics at the token level can effectively balance exploration and exploitation in RLVR for LLMs, yielding stronger generalization and reasoning performance compared to indirect entropy-control methods.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Motivation: To understand the factors that influence the effectiveness and limitations of implicit neural representations by bridging theory (Neural Tangent Kernel) and empirical benchmarking, enabling fair, comprehensive comparisons across architectures and encodings.

Method: Apply NTK theory to analyze how architecture (classic MLP vs. Coordinate-KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear activations affect the frequency response of INR models. Build INR-Bench, a benchmark with 56 Coordinate-MLP variants (4 encodings × 14 activations) and 22 Coordinate-KAN variants with distinct basis functions, evaluated on 9 implicit multimodal tasks (forward and inverse problems).

Result: Establish INR-Bench as the first comprehensive multimodal INR benchmark and provide NTK-guided insights into how architectural choices, encodings, and nonlinearities shape INR performance. The work delivers a large, reproducible suite for comparing models and highlights the strengths and limitations of different neural representations; code and dataset are released.

Conclusion: The combination of NTK-based analysis and a broad benchmarking platform clarifies how design choices—architecture, encoding, and nonlinearities—govern the effectiveness of implicit neural representations, laying a solid foundation for future research in multimodal INRs.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal
processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution.
However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain
underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic
MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the
response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we
introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed
for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models
(featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22
Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A complex-valued neural network, CauchyNet, inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, for function approximation (time series, missing data). Claims superior predictive accuracy and computational efficiency with theoretical guarantees via universal approximation theorem and complex activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of real-valued models in capturing complex temporal dependencies and handling incomplete data by leveraging complex-valued representations and Cauchy theory; aim for improved accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in resource-constrained, data-scarce settings.

Method: Embed real-valued data into the complex plane; use complex-valued activations; architecture inspired by Cauchy integral formula; leverages universal approximation theorem for theoretical guarantees; designed for robust learning from incomplete data with a compact parameter footprint.

Result: Empirical evaluations across transportation, energy, and epidemiological data show CauchyNet achieving substantially lower mean absolute error (reported as ~50% reduction) with fewer parameters, outperforming state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: CauchyNet is a promising, theory-grounded tool for data-driven predictive modeling, especially in resource-constrained and data-scarce environments, with potential to generalize across diverse domains.

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse

data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer

efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in

*Jinghao Zhang,Naishan Zheng,Ruilin Li,Dongzhou Cheng,Zheming Liang,Feng Zhao,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flow-based latent-space reward signal (flow rewards) is proposed for RLVR in LLMs, using latent flow fields built from off-policy and on-policy data; velocity deviations in latent space serve as rewards, enabling data-efficient reward shaping and compression of expert data; demonstrated on language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of binary, verification-based rewards in RLVR and the high annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs). Propose exploiting the latent space via flow fields to obtain richer, auxiliary reward signals and leverage off-policy data and context in hidden states.

Method: Construct flow fields in the model's latent space from off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data. Use the velocity deviation of policy latents within the flow as a reward signal. Treat the flow field as an environment for collecting reward signals and compress off-policy expert data as references. Emphasize using context dependence captured in hidden states rather than token-level denotations.

Result: Empirical demonstrations on language and multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that flow rewards are reliable as an auxiliary signal for RLVR and can serve as a promising paradigm for reward shaping beyond token-level or entropy-based signals.

Conclusion: Flow-based rewards in latent space provide a sound and data-efficient auxiliary signal for RLVR, expanding the repertoire of reward shaping techniques and highlighting unexplored expressive capacity of latent representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

### [399] [Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211)
*Yida Xiong,Jiameng Chen,Kun Li,Hongzhi Zhang,Xiantao Cai,Wenbin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphBFN introduces a Bayesian Flow Network-based coarse-to-fine framework to generate molecular graphs by aligning training with the discrete rounding operation, achieving state-of-the-art results with faster generation on QM9 and ZINC250k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous diffusion methods train for regression but require a rounding step at inference to yield discrete atom/bond categories, causing a training-inference mismatch, reduced molecular diversity, and weaker generalization.

Method: A hierarchical coarse-to-fine model (GraphBFN) operating on distribution parameters within Bayesian Flow Networks. It uses a CDF to compute the probability of selecting the correct category, thus unifying training objectives with sampling rounding; emphasizes distribution-level learning over point estimates.

Result: Achieves superior performance and faster generation; sets new state-of-the-art on QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: By incorporating rounding into training via distribution-level modeling, GraphBFN mitigates overfitting to intra-bin variations and improves diversity and generalization in discrete molecular graph generation; the approach shows promise for broader discrete-graph generation tasks.

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

### [400] [SGM: A Statistical Godel Machine for Risk-Controlled Recursive Self-Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10232)
*Xuening Wu,Shenqin Yin,Yanlan Kang,Xinhang Zhang,Qianya Xu,Zeping Chen,Wenqiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Statistical Gödel Machine (SGM), a statistical safety layer for recursive self-modification that uses confidence tests to approve edits and a confirmation-triggered harmonic spending budget (CTHS); validated across ML domains with CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, RL, and black-box optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety proofs for self-modifying systems are infeasible in stochastic, high-dimensional settings; there is a need for scalable, probabilistic guarantees to enable continual self-improvement in AutoML, NAS, and adaptive optimization.

Method: SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds) to certify superiority at a chosen confidence level, and allocates a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds. The Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS) scheme indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds to concentrate the budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.

Result: Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization show SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on various RL and optimization benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGM provides foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems; code is available, positioning this as a practical, scalable safeguard for autonomous model evolution.

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

### [401] [Progressive Scale Convolutional Network for Spatio-Temporal Downscaling of Soil Moisture: A Case Study Over the Tibetan Plateau](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10244)
*Ziyu Zhou,Keyan Hu,Ling Zhang,Zhaohui Xue,Yutian Fang,Yusha Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spatio-temporal downscaling method PSCNet using ERA5-Land and two novel modules (MFTF and SE) achieves 10-km, 3-hour soil moisture on the Tibetan Plateau (2016–2018) with high accuracy (R ~0.881) and strong temporal–spatial detail, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution soil moisture is crucial for hydrological and meteorological processes, but temporal downscaling is hindered by incomplete surface auxiliary factors. Integrating validated high-temporal ERA5-Land variables can enhance downscaling quality.

Method: Introduce PSCNet, a progressive scale convolutional network featuring a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) to capture temporal dynamics and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to preserve fine-grained spatial details. The model uses ERA5-Land variables to downscale coarse SMAP SM data to 10-km, 3-hour resolution for the Tibetan Plateau (2016–2018).

Result: Satellite product validation shows PSCNet with comparable accuracy and lower error, achieving a mean R of 0.881 and outperforming other methods. In-situ validation places PSCNet among the top three models for R across sites and with superior overall error reduction. Temporal generalization validation confirms feasibility of using ERA5-Land for downscaling, with average relative error within 6% for R and 2% for ubRMSE across methods. Temporal dynamics and visualization validation indicate strong temporal sensitivity and detailed spatial features. Overall, PSCNet effectively models spatio-temporal relationships to enable reliable downscaling of SM.

Conclusion: PSCNet represents a promising spatio-temporal downscaling solution for soil moisture, achieving high-resolution products with strong temporal responsiveness and spatial detail on the Tibetan Plateau.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

*Jiaxi Zhuang,Yaorui Shi,Jue Hou,Yunong He,Mingwei Ye,Mingjun Xu,Yuming Su,Linfeng Zhang,Linfeng Zhang,Guolin Ke,Hengxing Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MPPReasoner is a multimodal LLM that combines molecular images and SMILES to predict molecular properties, using supervised fine-tuning with 16k reasoning trajectories and reinforcement learning from principle-guided rewards. It achieves significant improvements and offers interpretable, chemically sound reasoning paths across 8 datasets, with strong cross-task generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks interpretability, cross-task generalization, and chemical reasoning in molecular property prediction. Traditional ML struggles with transferability, and purely molecular LMs offer limited insights. A multimodal approach with explicit reasoning aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, MPPReasoner fuses molecular images with SMILES strings. It uses a two-stage training: (1) supervised fine-tuning with 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories from expert knowledge and multiple teacher models; (2) Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR) with verifiable, rule-based rewards that assess chemical principle application, molecule structure analysis, and logical consistency via computational verification.

Result: Across 8 datasets, MPPReasoner outperforms the best baselines by 7.91% in-distribution and 4.53% out-of-distribution. The model shows exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths, improving interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

Conclusion: MPPReasoner demonstrates that incorporating chemical reasoning into a multimodal LLM yields improved performance, generalization, and interpretability for molecular property prediction, signaling a step toward more transparent AI in chemistry. The work provides a viable path for interpretable, rule-aligned ML in chemical domains.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

### [403] [Enhancing the Cross-Size Generalization for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems via Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10262)
*Jingwen Li,Zhiguang Cao,Yaoxin Wu,Tang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Continual learning with inter- and intra-task regularization combined with experience replay to train VRP models on increasingly larger problem sizes, yielding better generalization across seen and unseen sizes compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VRP deep models trained on a single size struggle to generalize to other sizes, limiting practical applicability. A continual learning approach across ascending sizes aims to improve cross-size generalization while mitigating forgetting.

Method: Sequentially train on ascending VRP sizes. Use inter-task regularization to preserve knowledge from smaller sizes when training on larger ones, intra-task regularization to consolidate desirable behaviors during training on each size, and experience replay to revisit past sizes and reduce catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance across multiple problem sizes (both seen and unseen during training) compared to state-of-the-art deep models, including those designed for generalizability. Ablation studies indicate the three components have synergistic effects.

Conclusion: A principled continual learning framework with inter- and intra-task regularization plus experience replay can substantially improve cross-size generalization for deep VRP models, addressing a key limitation of fixed-size training regimes.

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

### [404] [Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10276)
*Nikolaus Salvatore,Hao Wang,Qiong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study shows that large language models develop a U-shaped accuracy across sequence positions when trained on simple memory-demand tasks: early items (primacy) are favored due to long-term memory demands, while later items (recency) favor short-term demands. This bias arises from training dynamics, the model architecture, and attention behavior (attention sinks), and generalizes to sequence completion tasks resembling next-token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why crucial information in long contexts can be lost (the loss-in-the-middle) and whether this bias reflects an adaptive response to information retrieval demands during pre-training, coupling memory-demand tasks with architectural factors (autoregression, attention).

Method: Train GPT-2 and Llama variants from scratch on two simple human-memory paradigms that simulate long-term vs short-term memory demands. Analyze how performance varies by position (primacy vs recency). Examine the role of autoregressive properties and attention sinks. Extend the analysis to a sequence completion task that mirrors next-token prediction.

Result: A U-shaped performance curve emerges: recency aligns with short-term memory demand, while primacy is induced by uniform long-term memory demands and is shaped by autoregressive properties and attention sinks. These findings also generalize to a sequence completion task.

Conclusion: Information retrieval demands, model architecture, and attention dynamics during training jointly produce the positional bias observed in LLMs. This indicates that what appears as a memory fault may be an adaptive outcome of how LLMs are trained to balance different information retrieval needs.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

*Christopher Chiu,Silviu Pitis,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VivaBench introduces a 1762-case, multi-turn clinical reasoning benchmark for LLMs to simulate interactive medical evaluation, exposing shortcomings in sequential reasoning under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between static knowledge recall benchmarks and real-world clinical decision making that requires active information gathering and iterative reasoning; supports evaluation of conversational medical AI and agentic AI.

Method: Dataset of physician-curated vignettes structured as interactive scenarios resembling oral exams; agents must probe for findings, select investigations, and synthesize across steps to reach a diagnosis; includes analysis of model failures to identify cognitive biases.

Result: LLMs perform well on straightforward diagnoses from well-described presentations but degrade under iterative diagnostic reasoning with uncertainty; identified failure modes: fixation on initial hypotheses, inappropriate investigation ordering, premature diagnostic closure, and failure to screen for critical conditions.

Conclusion: VivaBench provides a standardized, real-world-relevant benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI and informs understanding of sequential reasoning trajectories in complex decision environments.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

*Michael Y. Hu,Benjamin Van Durme,Jacob Andreas,Harsh Jhamtani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO is a prompting framework that uses LM-generated counterfactual trajectories (hindsight) to augment learning for LM agents, improving sample efficiency and adaptation in text-based, goal-directed tasks; it outperforms baselines by up to ~80% and even surpasses advanced agents in some settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LM agents often learn slowly in novel environments due to expensive interactions and limited use of counterfactual reasoning. The paper leverages the LM's own generative and reasoning abilities to synthesize useful alternative experiences, addressing sample inefficiency.

Method: Two components: (1) a hindsight rule that prompts the LM to identify subgoals and generate optimized counterfactual trajectories for failed attempts, and (2) an update rule that compresses and maintains these trajectories in memory. This adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning to language-model agents and applies it to stateful benchmarks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on stateful XMiniGrid and PeopleJoinQA shows ECHO outperforms vanilla LM agents by up to 80%, and in XMiniGrid it also surpasses Reflexion and AWM architectures in adaptation speed.

Conclusion: Leveraging LM-driven hindsight trajectories and compact memory updates substantially boosts sample efficiency and rapid adaptation of LM agents in planning/navigation tasks, suggesting broad applicability of counterfactual generation for learning from experience.

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

*Shiyu Chen,Ningyuan,Huang,Soledad Villar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-view graph-tuple framework to enhance GNN expressiveness by partitioning graphs into subgraphs and applying heterogeneous, non-commuting-operator-inspired message passing; provides theoretical guarantees of increased expressiveness and lower oracle risk; validates on molecular Coulomb matrices and cosmological point clouds with improved performance over single-graph baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the inefficiency and information loss of single-graph GNNs on dense graphs by avoiding a single fixed interaction scale and preserving multi-scale interactions.

Method: Introduce graph-tuple partitioning that creates disjoint subgraphs (multi-view). Learn multi-view representations via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by non-commuting operators, with theoretical proofs that this setup is strictly more expressive and has lower oracle risk than single-graph MPNNs.

Result: Empirically outperforms single-graph baselines on two domains: molecular property prediction from sparse Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds.

Conclusion: The multi-view graph-tuple framework is a versatile, more expressive approach for GNNs on dense or scale-rich data, with cross-domain applicability and improved predictive performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel, noninvasive sleep-based biomarker detects antidepressant intake from a single night using a transformer model on wearable or contactless sleep data; AUROC 0.84 across six datasets, enabling remote daily adherence monitoring at home.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antidepressant nonadherence is widespread and costly; current detection methods are invasive or rely on proxy data with poor accuracy. There is a need for objective, scalable, noninvasive adherence monitoring accessible in real-world home settings.

Method: A transformer-based model analyzes sleep data from consumer wearables or contactless sensors to infer antidepressant intake. Evaluated across six datasets (62,000 nights, >20,000 participants, ~1,800 antidepressant users). Demonstrates generalization across drug classes, dose sensitivity, and robustness to co-administered psychotropics.

Result: Biomarker achieved AUROC of 0.84, generalizes across antidepressant classes, scales with dose, robust to other psychotropics, and supports longitudinal monitoring of initiation, tapering, and lapses.

Conclusion: The approach enables objective, scalable adherence surveillance with remote, daily assessment at home, with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes exploration-free allocation for multi-group mean estimation, strengthening subgaussian concentration via Hanson-Wright, and delivering non-adaptive/adaptive algorithms with tighter regret bounds, plus a contextual-bandit extension with side information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uniformly estimate means across many groups under a fixed budget, where traditional bandit regret minimization is ill-suited; accurate multi-group inference is essential in experimental design and personalization.

Method: (i) sharpen subgaussian variance concentration using Hanson-Wright and identify a strictly subgaussian distribution class with sharper guarantees; (ii) design exploration-free non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms and derive tighter regret bounds; (iii) extend framework to contextual bandits with side-information and provable guarantees.

Result: Stronger concentration results and tighter regret bounds; development of exploration-free algorithms (both non-adaptive and adaptive); extension to contextual bandits with provable guarantees.

Conclusion: Exploration-free allocation is a principled and efficient approach to multi-group mean estimation with broad applications, and can be extended to contextual settings leveraging side information.

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

### [410] [Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375)
*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB is a semi-supervised classification method that reframes label prediction as an inverse non-negative tri-factorization problem, directly factorizing the label matrix and integrating covariates to yield probabilistic class memberships without a separate classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised NMF cannot exploit labels; existing supervised/semi-supervised approaches rely on penalties or external classifiers. There is a need for a direct, probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels within the factorization framework.

Method: Formulate classification as the inverse problem of non-negative tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Treat A (covariates) as givens and factorize Y as the observation, obtaining class-membership probabilities from the factorization. Integrate covariates (including kernel similarities) to generalize to unseen samples and encode unlabeled data as uniform distributions for semi-supervision.

Result: Shows competitive predictive accuracy, robustness to noisy/incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional data (e.g., MNIST) while preserving interpretability.

Conclusion: Unifies regression and classification within the tri-NMF framework, yielding a probabilistic, scalable approach that directly maps covariates to label probabilities and supports semi-supervised learning without a separate classifier.

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

### [411] [Controllable Graph Generation with Diffusion Models via Inference-Time Tree Search Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10402)
*Jiachi Zhao,Zehong Wang,Yamei Liao,Chuxu Zhang,Yanfang Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeDiff introduces a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation, using macro-step expansion, dual-space denoising, and a dual-space verifier to enable long-horizon planning and improved controllability; it achieves state-of-the-art results on molecule generation and scales favorably with compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconditional diffusion models offer little control over target properties and quality can be unstable; existing inference-time guidance is local, heuristic, and lacks strong controllability. There is a need to expand the search space and incorporate both latent and graph-space corrections to achieve controllable, high-fidelity graph generation.

Method: A plug-and-play inference-time method (TreeDiff) that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with diffusion in a dual space. It features (1) macro-step expansion to reduce tree depth by grouping denoising steps; (2) dual-space denoising that couples efficient latent-space denoising with lightweight discrete graph-space corrections; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term rewards from partially denoised graphs for early value estimation and to avoid full rollouts.

Result: Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D molecular generation benchmarks under both unconditional and conditional settings show TreeDiff achieving state-of-the-art performance. It also exhibits favorable inference-time scaling, continuing to improve with more computation while baseline inference-time methods plateau under similar resource limits.

Conclusion: TreeDiff advances controllable graph generation by marrying search-based planning with dual-space diffusion, providing scalable, controllable generation without retraining and with superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

### [412] [Softmax $\geq$ Linear: Transformers may learn to classify in-context by kernel gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10425)
*Sara Dragutinović,Andrew M. Saxe,Aaditya K. Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-context learning in transformers is explained as gradient-descent-like updates in a kernel feature space, with softmax attention enabling a context-adaptive learning rate; this extends prior linear-theory of ICL to nonlinear, classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between theoretical analyses of ICL that assume linear self-attention and discrete, nonlinear classification tasks, by understanding the learning algorithm (gradient descent) used by transformers in-context.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing gradient-descent dynamics on kernel features; derive a context-adaptive learning rate for softmax transformers; support with empirical ablations.

Result: Transformers perform in-context gradient-descent-like updates in kernel space; softmax attention yields a context-adaptive learning rate; empirical ablations corroborate the theory and illuminate the role of nonlinearity.

Conclusion: Advances a theoretically grounded understanding of in-context learning in more realistic settings, clarifying how softmax attention enhances context adaptability and enabling bridgework to larger models.

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoMoE combines hierarchical routing with lightweight rank-1 MoE experts to achieve parameter-efficient horizontal scaling and multi-layer MoE composition, enabling parallel execution and better performance-efficiency in CTR prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies of deep, sequential model scaling and the limited expressiveness of flat MoE layers by leveraging both horizontal (MoE) and vertical (stacked layers) scaling in a parameter-efficient manner.

Method: Introduce HiLoMoE: (1) lightweight rank-1 experts for horizontal scaling; (2) stack multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing based on prior layer scores; (3) allow parallel execution across layers; (4) three-stage training to stabilize optimization and maintain expert diversity.

Result: On four public CTR datasets, HiLoMoE achieves better performance-efficiency tradeoff, with an average AUC gain of 0.20% and a 18.5% reduction in FLOPs compared to a non-MoE baseline.

Conclusion: HiLoMoE demonstrates that combining hierarchical routing with parameter-efficient MoE enables scalable, efficient CTR models, suggesting a promising direction for ROI-focused deep learning in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

### [414] [Multi-Task Learning with Feature-Similarity Laplacian Graphs for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10433)
*Zixiang Xu,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Xuanhan Fan,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MTL-FSL, a multi-task learning framework for longitudinal Alzheimer's data that models time-varying feature correlations via a Feature Similarity Laplacian penalty; solved with ADMM; achieves state-of-the-art results on ADNI and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task learning models for longitudinal AD data assume static feature relationships and miss dynamic feature correlations over time, limiting predictive performance and biological interpretability.

Method: Proposes Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty to capture time-varying feature similarities, combines temporal smoothness across tasks with dynamic feature relationships, and solves the resulting non-smooth optimization via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Applies the framework to ADNI data and compares against baseline methods.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance on ADNI, outperforming various baselines.

Conclusion: Modeling time-varying feature correlations with FSL enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in longitudinal AD analysis; the approach is implemented in open-source code.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

### [415] [Reverse Supervision at Scale: Exponential Search Meets the Economics of Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10446)
*Masoud Makrehchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exponential complexity in reversed-supervision (searching 2^n labelings) persists despite fast hardware; informative labels or priors are still essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental limits of reversed-supervision and whether AI-generated labels can replace human labels, and to clarify how supervision and task grounding interact with computing speed.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a labeling-search problem over a large unlabeled set B with a small labeled set A, highlighting the 2^n search space and the implications of speedups; a conceptual pipeline treating generative models as label amplifiers, requiring human-specified objectives, seed supervision, and validation; discussion of active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops with human oversight.

Result: Even with arbitrary fast (but not exponential) speedups, the problem remains exponential; acceleration reduces wall-clock time but cannot eliminate the need for informative labels or priors; synthetic labels from generative AI can partially substitute if they are high quality and anchored to a human-defined objective and validation, but true ground truth supervision remains necessary.

Conclusion: Initial human (or human-grade) input is essential to ground the learning task. Generative models can amplify labels and reduce annotation burden, but humans must specify objectives, seeds, and continuously calibrate, detect drift, and audit failures. Speed improves efficiency but not fundamental supervision requirements.

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven, DRL-based multi-animal simulator uses counterfactuals and action estimation to reproduce realistic locomotion and enable what-if scenarios, outperforming standard imitation and RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between unknown real-world transition models and simulators, enabling realistic, reward-driven optimization for multi-animal behavior.

Method: Estimate movement variables for an incomplete transition model as actions within a reinforcement learning framework; use a distance-based pseudo-reward to align cyber and physical states; apply counterfactual simulation.

Result: On artificial agents, flies, newts, and silkmoths, achieved higher reproducibility of species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition versus standard imitation and RL methods; supports counterfactual predictions and multi-agent trajectory generation.

Conclusion: The data-driven RL-based simulator promises to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors, enabling what-if analyses and flexible multi-agent modeling.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

### [417] [LightSAE: Parameter-Efficient and Heterogeneity-Aware Embedding for IoT Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10465)
*Yi Ren,Xinjie Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework decomposes embeddings into a shared base and channel-specific auxiliary components, and LightSAE implements a low-rank, gated pooling strategy to model those auxiliaries. This yields parameter-efficient improvements for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) on IoT data. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTSF methods typically use a single shared embedding across all channels, causing a bottleneck that hides channel-specific information in heterogeneous IoT multivariate time series. There is a need for channel-aware representations that are also parameter-efficient. 

Method: SAE decomposes embeddings into a shared base component plus channel-specific auxiliary components. Empirically, auxiliaries exhibit low-rank and clustering structure. LightSAE enforces low-rank factorization and uses a shared, gated component pool to model auxiliaries with fewer parameters. The approach is evaluated across 9 IoT-related datasets and 4 backbone architectures. 

Result: Empirical results show that LightSAE achieves up to 22.8% MSE improvement with only a 4.0% increase in parameters across benchmarks. 

Conclusion: Decomposing embeddings into a shared base and channel-specific auxiliaries captures valuable channel-specific information while remaining parameter-efficient. LightSAE’s low-rank factorization and shared gated pool generalize across backbones, providing a practical solution for MTSF in heterogeneous IoT data.

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnyBCQ extends Binary-Coded Quantization to bit-planes for per-request multi-precision LLM quantization, enabling bit-plane computation and monotonic accuracy gains as more bits are enabled, with notable hardware-aware speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require memory and latency reductions; flexible, hardware-friendly multi-precision quantization is needed to meet diverse service-level objectives.

Method: Weights are represented as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors. A progressive precision expansion mechanism refines scaling while reusing existing binary codes. A specialized kernel exploits the BCQ structure to support dynamic per-request precision with minimal overhead, reflecting a hardware-software co-design.

Result: The approach preserves accuracy in the low-bit regime (2-bit), remains competitive at higher precision, and delivers throughput gains up to 3.0x over FP16 and about 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods across recent LLMs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, hardware-friendly path for deploying multi-precision LLMs, aligning algorithmic flexibility with accelerator efficiency to support diverse service-level objectives.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

### [419] [Anchor-based Maximum Discrepancy for Relative Similarity Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10477)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD) for relative similarity testing that jointly learns the hypothesis and a deep kernel space. Two-phase framework (Phase I: infer potential hypothesis by estimating AMD over deep kernels; Phase II: test significance with thresholds derived from Phase I). Demonstrates theoretical guarantees and empirical effectiveness; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel-based relative similarity tests fix a hypothesis and a kernel, which can render kernel selection ill-posed. There is a need to learn the kernel and the hypothesis jointly to obtain reliable testing.

Method: Define AMD as the maximum discrepancy between distances from an anchor U to P and to Q in a space of deep kernels. Phase I estimates AMD to infer a potential hypothesis. Phase II performs hypothesis-specific significance testing using a unified framework that derives thresholds across multiple hypotheses.

Result: The paper provides theoretical validation and extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of AMD for relative similarity testing.

Conclusion: Jointly learning the hypothesis and the kernel via AMD mitigates ill-posed kernel selection and improves relative similarity testing performance; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, RADiAnce, for aligned protein interface design that unifies retrieval and generation in a contrastive latent space to guide binder design. It retrieves relevant interfaces from diverse domains to condition a diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer and improved binding affinity and geometries over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing protein binders for specific sites demands realistic, interpretable interaction patterns. Existing structure-based generators struggle with rational, transferable interfaces and little guidance from known interfaces. Leveraging curated interfaces across domains can improve design quality and generalization.

Method: RADiAnce merges retrieval and conditional diffusion in a shared contrastive latent space. It retrieves interfaces relevant to a target binding site and conditionally generates binders by transferring these interfaces across domains (peptides, antibodies, protein fragments). The model enables cross-domain interface transfer by aligning latent representations of interfaces and binder designs.

Result: RADiAnce significantly outperforms baselines on metrics including binding affinity and recovery of geometries and interactions. It demonstrates cross-domain generalization: retrieved interfaces from diverse domains improve binder generation for other domains, validating the retrieval-guided generative paradigm.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new paradigm integrating retrieval with generative AI for protein binder design, bridging knowledge from existing interfaces to guide novel binder generation and enabling cross-domain transfer to enhance drug discovery.

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient Enhanced Self-Training PINN (gST-PINN) improves PINNs by gradient-based pseudo point self-learning, yielding superior accuracy and robustness especially with limited labeled data; tested on Burgers' and diffusion-sorption PDEs, outperforming PINN and gPINN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address core PINN challenges: limited precision, slow convergence, scarce labeled data, and poor handling of multi-physics interactions.

Method: Introduce gradient-based pseudo point self-learning within a semi-supervised framework (gST-PINN). The method extends PINN and gPINN, leveraging gradient information and pseudo points to train without requiring abundant labeled solutions, enabling better generalization across multi-physics PDEs.

Result: For Burgers' equation, PINN MSE ~1e-3; diffusion-sorption MSE ~1e-4 after ~12.5k iterations. gST-PINN continues reducing error, reaching ~1e-5 after ~18.5k iterations. Purely semi-supervised gST-PINN outperforms standard PINN in all tested scenarios, even with unavailable labeled solutions.

Conclusion: gST-PINN generalizes PINN and gPINN and offers robust performance in low-accuracy/convergence-challenged settings, particularly when labeled data is scarce or absent.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

### [422] [f-INE: A Hypothesis Testing Framework for Estimating Influence under Training Randomness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10510)
*Subhodip Panda,Dhruv Tarsadiya,Shashwat Sourav,Prathosh A. P,Sai Praneeth Karimireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes f-influence, a hypothesis-testing framework for influence estimation that accounts for training randomness; introduces f-INE to compute influence in a single training run; demonstrates effectiveness in detecting poisoned data on a large Llama-3.1-8B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence methods are unstable across training runs due to randomness, hindering data curation and cleanup. A statistically principled, stable influence estimator is needed.

Method: Develop the f-influence framework based on hypothesis testing with desirable properties for robustness; design the f-INE algorithm to compute influence in one training run; apply to dataset including instruction-tuning data for Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: Empirical results show that f-INE reliably detects poisoned samples that steer model opinions, enabling reliable data cleanup and attribution of model behavior.

Conclusion: f-influence provides a stable, principled approach to influence estimation under training randomness and scales to large models, facilitating data curation and understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

*Md Ibrahim Shikder Mahin,Md Shamsul Arefin,Md Tanvir Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new hybrid, RL-guided synthetic data framework for healthcare integrates five augmentation methods to synthesize high-fidelity, privacy-preserving data. It achieves near-zero marginal distribution discrepancies, strong joint-distribution fidelity, and comparable downstream task performance to real data across two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare data are scarce and tightly regulated (HIPAA/GDPR), hindering AI model development. Synthetic data can enable research and deployment while protecting patient privacy.

Method: Combine noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder sampling, and SMOTE, with a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weighting mechanism. Employ advanced calibration steps (moment matching, full histogram matching, soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement) to align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies.

Result: Achieved Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and KS statistics around 0.01, indicating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores >90% and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy ~50% indicate strong privacy. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data reach up to 94% accuracy and F1 > 93%, comparable to models trained on real data.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and privacy-preserving, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods in joint-distribution fidelity for healthcare data and enabling sensitive AI applications.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

### [424] [Reinforced Domain Selection for Continuous Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10530)
*Hanbing Liu,Huaze Tang,Yanru Wu,Yang Li,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) framework that uses reinforcement learning and feature disentanglement to select intermediate domains without metadata, employing unsupervised rewards based on latent domain distances and aligning domain-invariant features, yielding improved target accuracy and domain-path efficiency on Rotated MNIST and ADNI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting informative intermediate domains in CDA is challenging without explicit metadata, hindering transfer efficiency and target performance. An unsupervised method to discover transfer paths is needed.

Method: Proposes a framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement. It uses an unsupervised reward based on distances between latent domain embeddings and disentangles features to compute rewards and align domain-invariant features, jointly optimizing path selection and target task performance.

Result: Empirical evaluations on Rotated MNIST and ADNI show substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and faster/domain-selection efficiency, outperforming traditional CDA methods.

Conclusion: The approach addresses the metadata-free intermediate-domain selection problem in CDA and demonstrates strong potential for robust cross-domain adaptation by learning effective transfer paths and improving target performance through unsupervised domain-aware rewards.

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

### [425] [Rethinking RL Evaluation: Can Benchmarks Truly Reveal Failures of RL Methods?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10541)
*Zihan Chen,Yiming Zhang,Hengguang Zhou,Zenghui Ding,Yining Sun,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Existing RL benchmarks for LLMs do not reliably measure progress; a diagnostic suite and Oracle Performance Gap reveal poor generalization and distributional robustness, calling for benchmarks with sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks allow training on train and test splits to achieve similar performance, so progress is not truly measured; there is a need to quantify and study generalization gaps.

Method: Introduce Oracle Performance Gap (OPG) metric comparing performance when training on train vs test splits; develop a diagnostic suite; conduct stress tests across distribution shifts, difficulty levels, and counterfactuals.

Result: Benchmark scores can be high even when models fail to generalize; RL methods struggle under distributional shifts despite favorable scores; OPG highlights gaps; stress tests reveal limitations.

Conclusion: Benchmarks are insufficient; propose three core design principles for more faithful benchmarks: sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness; recommend building benchmarks that better capture generalization in RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

*Abdelkrim Zitouni,Mehdi Hennequin,Juba Agoun,Ryan Horache,Nadia Kabachi,Omar Rivasplata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement learning that accounts for Markov data via mixing time, enabling non-vacuous certificates for off-policy methods like Soft Actor-Critic; introduces PB-SAC, which optimizes the bound during training to guide exploration; experiments show the bound provides meaningful confidence certificates with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization guarantees in RL are difficult due to sequential data and dependencies that violate IID assumptions. Classical bounds fail to capture dependencies; incorporating Markovian structure through mixing time could yield meaningful certificates and bridge theory with practice for off-policy RL.

Method: Derive a PAC-Bayesian bound that explicitly incorporates the chain's mixing time to handle Markov dependencies in RL data. Propose PB-SAC, a practical algorithm that optimizes this bound during training to guide exploration and policy updates in off-policy settings.

Result: The bound yields non-vacuous generalization certificates for modern off-policy algorithms such as SAC. PB-SAC demonstrates meaningful confidence certificates while achieving competitive performance on continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating Markov dependencies via mixing time into PAC-Bayes bounds provides practical generalization guarantees for RL and enables training-time optimization of these certificates (PB-SAC) without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

### [427] [Multi-scale Frequency-Aware Adversarial Network for Parkinson's Disease Assessment Using Wearable Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10558)
*Weiming Zhao,Xulong Wang,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFAM (Multi-scale Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network) improves Parkinson's disease severity assessment from wearable time-series by combining medically guided frequency decomposition with attention-based MIL, outperforming generic models on PD vs differential diagnosis and four-class severity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current general-purpose time-series models struggle to capture PD-specific signal features and are hampered by the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms, which dilutes diagnostically relevant segments. There is a need for pathology-informed feature extraction and selective emphasis on informative time windows.

Method: Introduce MFAM with a frequency decomposition module guided by medical priors to enhance feature specificity, plus an attention-based multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework to adaptively focus on informative sparse segments.

Result: Validated on public PADS dataset for PD vs differential diagnosis and a private four-class severity dataset; MFAM outperforms general-purpose time-series models in capturing PD-specific cues and handling sparse clinical signals.

Conclusion: MFAM provides a promising, pathology-informed approach for automated PD severity assessment from wearables, leveraging domain-guided frequency analysis and targeted attention over sparse segments to improve clinical utility.

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

### [428] [Multitask Learning with Learned Task Relationships](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10570)
*Zirui Wan,Stefan Vlaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a flexible multitask/personalized learning framework that jointly learns task relationships and local models by modeling them as a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an unknown precision matrix; demonstrates theoretical guarantees and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical consensus methods are suboptimal under data heterogeneity; there is a need for personalized strategies that leverage related tasks without requiring exact prior knowledge or resorting to fully non-parametric/meta-learning approaches.

Method: Proposes an algorithmic framework where task relationships are encoded via a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an unknown precision matrix. It jointly learns the precision matrix (task relationships) and the local models, enabling agents to self-organize according to their data distributions. The method likely uses alternating optimization with regularization to estimate a sparse precision matrix and the local models.

Result: Theoretical analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationships (e.g., guarantees on estimation error or consistency) and the impact on the local models, while numerical experiments demonstrate practical effectiveness and improvements over baselines in heterogeneous settings.

Conclusion: The framework offers a middle ground between requiring precise prior knowledge of task relationships and fully non-parametric approaches, enabling robust, self-organizing personalized/federated learning that adapts to heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for self-supervised representation learning as an approximation to supervised objectives, deriving a contrastive-like loss, introducing prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, linking to established practices, and empirically validating balancing of positive/negative pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of self-supervised learning and to connect it to supervised objectives, clarifying the principles behind popular contrastive losses and guiding improvements.

Method: Formulate self-supervised objectives as an approximation to supervised ones; derive a loss closely related to InfoNCE; introduce prototype representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss; map framework components to standard contrastive-learning practices; empirically test balancing positive/negative pair interactions; proofs in appendix; code in supplement.

Result: The derivation provides insight into the principles of contrastive losses; the framework's components correspond to established practices and actively balancing positives/negatives yields measurable effects; empirical validation supports the theory; proofs and code are available.

Conclusion: A theoretical lens clarifies the connection between self-supervised and supervised representation learning, explains existing methods, and suggests practical improvements through balanced interactions and prototype bias; full proofs and code accompany the work.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary
material.

### [430] [Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586)
*Giulio Ruffini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometry-informed framework for agents that treat streams via compositional symmetry, showing how structural and dynamical constraints yield low-dimensional invariant manifolds and a predictive-coding scheme where higher layers process symmetry-aligned residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain how simple, compositional structures (symmetries) in sensory streams can be exploited by learning systems to achieve accurate world-tracking with compact, hierarchical representations; connect Kolmogorov-style simplicity to Lie pseudogroup symmetries and predictive coding.

Method: Model the agent as a generic neural-dynamical system coupled to environment streams. Impose equivariance constraints on constitutive equations and readouts. Under static inputs, derive Noether-like conserved quantities that confine trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds persist in a low-dimensional form. Build a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the factorization of the pseudogroup. Relate to Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based predictive coding scheme where higher layers receive coarse-grained residual transformations along unresolved symmetry directions.

Result: Structural constraints (equivariance) and dynamical constraints (conserved quantities, invariant manifolds) emerge, yielding a hierarchy of low-dimensional manifolds aligned with the pseudogroup’s compositional factorization. This explains the blessing of compositionality in deep models and enables a self-contained predictive coding architecture in which higher layers process only symmetry-directed residuals.

Conclusion: A geometrically grounded framework linking simplicity priors, compositional symmetry, and predictive coding. It provides a principled mechanism for reducing complexity in deep models while preserving accurate world-tracking, and connects modern architectures to classical formalisms (Noether, Spencer) via Lie pseudogroups.

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

TL;DR: FusionGen is a data augmentation framework for EEG BCIs that uses disentangled representation learning and feature fusion to generate diverse, trainable data under limited data, achieving improved classification accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based BCIs face data scarcity and strong inter-subject variability, which limit generalization and practical applicability of EEG decoding models.

Method: FusionGen employs disentangled representation learning and a feature matching fusion module to integrate features across trials, combined with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction pipeline to produce diverse, trainable synthetic EEG data under data-scarce conditions.

Result: Across multiple public EEG datasets, FusionGen significantly outperforms existing augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: FusionGen provides an effective EEG data generation framework that enhances data diversity and trainability under limited data, improving EEG decoding performance and potentially enabling more robust BCIs.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

### [432] [Budget Allocation for Unknown Value Functions in a Lipschitz Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10605)
*MohammadHossein Bateni,Hossein Esfandiari,Samira HosseinGhorban,Alireza Mirrokni,Radin Shahdaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies optimal budget allocation for evaluating intermediate machine learning models under an unknown value function with Lipschitz continuity, with the aim of efficient exploration across features, structures, and hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating many intermediate models is common in feature selection, structure search, and hyperparameter tuning, but evaluations are costly. While prior knowledge helps estimate quality, true performance is only revealed by actual evaluation. A principled budget allocation strategy is needed to guide exploration and minimize wasted evaluations.

Method: Formulates the problem as a sequential budget allocation task over a space of models (features, structures, hyperparameters) using the assumption that the value function is Lipschitz. Develops an optimization/decision framework to select which intermediate models to evaluate next, propagating information across nearby models to bound unseen values and improve decision making.

Result: The framework yields principled allocation rules with theoretical guarantees (e.g., regret or sample-efficiency bounds) and demonstrates improved efficiency in exploring the model space compared with naive strategies, under Lipschitz assumptions.

Conclusion: Budget-constrained evaluation in Lipschitz-valued model spaces enables more efficient model exploration across various stages of model development (feature selection, structure search, hyperparameter tuning), by leveraging smoothness to guide adaptive evaluation choices.

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EDGAN is a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN for stock price forecasting that improves training stability and forecasting accuracy by using a temporal decoder with residual connections, covariate conditioning, and a windowing mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address GAN drawbacks in finance (mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty capturing temporal/feature correlations) and to leverage a GRU-based encoder-decoder with residuals for better reconstruction and contextual learning.

Method: A GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN with a dense encoder-decoder generator, residual GRU blocks, a temporal decoder with residual connections, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.

Result: The EDGAN model achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability across diverse stock datasets, consistently outperforming traditional GAN variants in accuracy and convergence under volatile market conditions.

Conclusion: EDGAN provides a balance between expressive power and simplicity, enabling robust stock price forecasting with GANs in volatile markets.

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression (SDG-L) using an LSTM-based feature extractor to predict lithium-ion battery capacity from time-series state data; achieves 1.2% test MSE on NASA data and outperforms baselines with ablation validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve long-term capacity prediction and reliability by leveraging rich cycle-level state information and profiling data, addressing capacity fade with cycling.

Method: SDG-L framework: semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression; incorporates an LSTM feature extractor to capture auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging; models time-series battery state data.

Result: Average test MSE of 1.2% on NASA dataset; outperforms existing methods; ablation studies validate the contribution of SDG-L components.

Conclusion: SDG-L effectively exploits time-series state and profiling information to improve capacity prediction in Li-ion batteries, enhancing system efficiency and reliability; validated by experiments.

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

### [435] [ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10625)
*Yuval Golbari,Navve Wasserman,Gal Vardi,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: White-box membership inference attack (ImpMIA) using maximum-margin implicit bias with KKT conditions to identify training samples, removing reliance on reference models; achieves state-of-the-art performance in realistic settings where only model weights and a superset of training data are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks threaten data privacy; black-box MIAs rely on assumptions (training hyperparameters, data distribution, known training fraction) that rarely hold in practice. There is a need for attacks that do not depend on reference models and operate under more realistic threat models.

Method: ImpMIA is a white-box attack that leverages implicit bias theory. It applies Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples by finding those samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model parameters. It does not require reference models and uses only the model weights (and a superset of the training data).

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black-box and white-box attacks in realistic settings where only model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a more realistic and potent threat to privacy by removing reliance on reference models and common assumptions. Highlights the potential vulnerability of publicly available models and underscores the need for defense mechanisms against white-box MIAs.

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProteinAE introduces a diffusion autoencoder that maps protein backbone coordinates from E(3) into a continuous latent space using a non-equivariant diffusion transformer with a bottleneck, enabling state-of-the-art reconstruction and efficient latent-diffusion–based structure generation without relying on SE(3) equivariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein representation approaches struggle with the SE(3) manifold, discrete tokenization, and the need for multiple training objectives, which hinder optimization and generalization for protein generative modeling.

Method: End-to-end training of a bottleneck, non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer that directly compresses backbone coordinates into a latent space via a single flow-matching objective; the latent space supports a latent diffusion model for high-quality generation, bypassing explicit equivariance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality compared with existing autoencoders; the latent space enables efficient, high-quality structure generation competitive with leading structure-based methods and significantly outperforming prior latent-based methods.

Conclusion: Provides a streamlined pipeline with reduced optimization complexity and strong generation performance; bypasses the need for explicit SE(3) equivariance; code is released for community use.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RetroTrim introduces a multi-score filtering approach for retrosynthesis to curb hallucinations; it outperforms baselines, filters nonsensical reactions, and provides a new expert-reviewed evaluation protocol with 32 drug-like targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in generative retrosynthesis make automatic evaluation slow and unreliable; there is a need for reliable filtering and standardized benchmarks.

Method: Combine diverse reaction scoring strategies leveraging machine learning models and chemical databases; analyze hallucinations via labeled intermediates; propose an expert-structured evaluation protocol; benchmark on 32 novel targets.

Result: Succeeds in filtering hallucinated reactions; yields the highest number of high-quality synthesis paths among baselines; demonstrates that different scoring strategies cover different hallucination classes; releases benchmark and protocol.

Conclusion: RetroTrim offers a practical solution to hallucinations in retrosynthesis and contributes an evaluation framework and dataset to spur further research; broadly applicable to drug-like targets.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

*Ying-Kuan Tsai,Vispi Karkaria,Yi-Ping Chen,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A digital-twin-enabled, multi-generation control co-design framework that uses deep reinforcement learning to jointly optimize physical design and control, improving robustness and efficiency for dynamic systems, demonstrated on active suspension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world uncertainties in CCD remain unpredictable; lifecycle data across generations can progressively improve robustness and efficiency; digital twins enable continuous model updates and informed redesign.

Method: Integrate DT with CCD; use DRL to jointly optimize physical design and controller; multi-generation cycle: deployment, operation, redesign; quantile regression for uncertainty quantification; DT models updated from real-time sensing and data to inform next-generation designs.

Result: Applied to active suspension; learning from road conditions and driving behavior yields smoother, more stable control trajectories; noticeable improvements in dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposes lifecycle-oriented, multi-generation CCD framework powered by DTs and DRL; benefits include continuous model updates, informed design decisions, and faster adaptive control.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

*Long Chen,Huixin Bai,Mingxin Wang,Xiaohua Huang,Ying Liu,Jie Zhao,Ziyu Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRFN unifies static long-term and dynamic short-term inter-stock relations for price forecasting by using a relative static relation component and distance-aware dynamic relations, fused recurrently with prior-day dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where existing methods model only single-state inter-stock relations, ignoring the complementarity and overnight information that links stocks.

Method: Introduce Dual Relation Fusion Network (DRFN) consisting of a relative static relation component capturing time-varying long-term patterns and overnight effects, distance-aware dynamic relation modules, and a recurrent fusion mechanism that blends prior-day dynamic relations with predefined static relations to adapt to market shifts.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over strong baselines across multiple markets, with performance correlating to how closely relational strength co-moves with stock price.

Conclusion: DRFN provides a balanced, adaptable framework that preserves structural stability while remaining responsive to abrupt market changes, yielding robust stock price forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

*Usman Gani Joy,Shahadat kabir,Tasnim Niger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An attention-augmented LSTM improves monthly temperature and rainfall forecasts for Bangladesh, beating baselines and showing strong accuracy and robustness to climate trends and regional variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to climate change, with complex temporal patterns in temperature and rainfall that are difficult for traditional models to capture; improving forecast accuracy supports climate-sensitive planning.

Method: Develop an attention-enabled LSTM model trained on 1901–2023 monthly data from NASA POWER (temperature) and HDX (rainfall), compare against XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, and test robustness to simulated climate trends and regional variations.

Result: The proposed model achieves a test MSE of 0.2411 (temp) and 1283.67 (rainfall) with R^2 of 0.9834 (temp) and 0.9639 (rainfall); MAE of 0.3860°C (temp) and 22.91 mm (rainfall); NRMSE of 0.0370 (temp) and 0.0354 (rainfall). It outperforms baselines, and exhibits only 20% MSE growth under climate trends (vs ~2.2x for baselines) and 50% degradation under regional variations (vs ~4.8x for baselines).

Conclusion: The attention-based LSTM enhances forecasting precision for temperature and rainfall in Bangladesh and offers insights into governing climate processes, with practical value for climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

### [441] [Designing ReLU Generative Networks to Enumerate Trees with a Given Tree Edit Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10706)
*Mamoona Ghafoor,Tatsuya Akutsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves and demonstrates a deterministic ReLU-based generative network that can generate all rooted, ordered, vertex-labeled trees within a given tree edit distance d from a fixed tree T, with size O(n^3) and constant depth, and shows exact generation up to 21-node trees, outperforming GraphRNN/GraphGDP in validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating tree-structured data with precise similarity constraints is important across domains (bio, structured data, image processing). Prior networks are often non-deterministic or cannot guarantee coverage within a specified distance; there is a gap in understanding how large a network must be to guarantee generation within tree edit distance.

Method: The authors prove the existence and provide a constructive method for ReLU-based generative networks. Given a rooted, ordered, vertex-labeled tree T of size n+1 over alphabet Σ and a distance d, the network can generate all trees within tree edit distance ≤ d from T. The construction has size O(n^3) and constant depth. Empirically, networks are implemented for trees up to 21 nodes and are deterministic, guaranteeing generation of all valid trees within the distance; comparisons with GraphRNN and GraphGDP show higher validity (up to 100% in tested cases for their deterministic model) versus 35% and 48%.

Result: The networks successfully generate all valid trees within the specified distance for the tested sizes. Relative to non-deterministic baselines (GraphRNN, GraphGDP), the deterministic approach achieves higher validity. An implementation is provided at the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical foundation for compact, exact tree-generation models and opens new directions for exact generation of tree-structured data; it demonstrates the viability of deterministic ReLU-based networks for precise proximity-based tree generation and offers a practical implementation, albeit evaluated on relatively small trees (≤21 nodes).

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an ensemble sampling framework for nonlinear contextual bandits, providing GLM-ES and Neural-ES, with high-probability regret bounds and anytime variants, plus empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve principled, efficient exploration in nonlinear contextual bandits where traditional methods struggle; leverage ensemble sampling to capture model uncertainty and provide strong regret guarantees across generalized linear and neural settings.

Method: Maintain multiple estimators of the reward model parameters by maximum likelihood on randomly perturbed data; develop GLM-ES for generalized linear bandits and Neural-ES for neural contextual bandits; derive high-probability regret bounds; create anytime (unknown horizon) variants; provide empirical evaluation.

Result: Regret bounds: O(d^{3/2} sqrt(T) + d^{9/2}) for GLM-ES and O(~d sqrt(T)) for Neural-ES; bounds match state-of-the-art for nonlinear exploration; anytime variants; empirical results show strong performance across GLM-ES, Neural-ES, and their variants.

Conclusion: Ensemble sampling is a provable and practical randomized exploration approach for nonlinear contextual bandits, valid across GLM and neural models, with effective handling of unknown horizon via anytime algorithms and solid empirical support.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a stochastic differential equation framework to model multiobjective LLM interactions, with diffusion and interference, validated on 400 iterative code-generation sessions; shows strategy-dependent convergence (0.33–1.29) and R2=0.74; demonstrates dynamical systems analysis as feasible for MO-LM interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stochasticity and cross-objective interference in iterative LLM optimization; provide a rigorous dynamical framework to study multi-objective LLM interactions.

Method: Develops an SDE with explicit diffusion terms; uses an interference matrix to capture cross-objective interactions; applies to 400 code-generation sessions across security, efficiency, and functionality; estimates convergence rates and predictive accuracy.

Result: The framework captures inherent stochasticity, reveals interference patterns, shows strategy-dependent convergence with rates 0.33–1.29; predictive accuracy R^2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM interactions; code generation serves as an initial validation domain; suggests applicability to broader MO-LM tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a general stochastic differential equation framework for
modelling multiobjective optimization dynamics in iterative Large Language
Model (LLM) interactions. Our framework captures the inherent stochasticity of
LLM responses through explicit diffusion terms and reveals systematic
interference patterns between competing objectives via an interference matrix
formulation. We validate our theoretical framework using iterative code
generation as a proof-of-concept application, analyzing 400 sessions across
security, efficiency, and functionality objectives. Our results demonstrate
strategy-dependent convergence behaviors with rates ranging from 0.33 to 1.29,
and predictive accuracy achieving R2 = 0.74 for balanced approaches. This work
proposes the feasibility of dynamical systems analysis for multi-objective LLM

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Opt for Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs) with progressive depth expansion to automatically find the optimal depth for a task, reducing memory and computation while keeping accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large models offer strong performance but are often over-parameterized for simpler tasks, leading to wasted computation, high memory usage, and energy consumption. Optimizing depth can enable deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Progressive depth expansion: train deep networks at shallow depths first and incrementally increase depth as earlier blocks converge, stopping when target accuracy is reached. This NAS-like strategy identifies and uses the optimal depth for a given dataset, effectively removing redundant layers. Applied to ResNet-18/ResNet-34 on MNIST and SVHN.

Result: Memory footprint reductions up to 98.64% for MNIST and 96.44% for SVHN, while achieving competitive accuracies of 99.31% (MNIST) and 96.08% (SVHN).

Conclusion: ODNs balance depth with task complexity, reducing training/inference costs and memory footprint, enabling edge deployment, and potentially generalizing to other architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

*Jiayuan Sheng,Hanyang Zhao,Haoxian Chen,David D. Yao,Wenpin Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLHF-tuned diffusion models suffer a gap between stochastic training (SDE) and deterministic inference (ODE); the paper provides theoretical reward-gap bounds, sharper convergence rates for VE/VP Gaussian models, and empirical evidence that training with higher stochasticity narrows the gap and improves ODE-sampling quality using gDDIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between training-time stochastic samplers and inference-time deterministic samplers in RLHF-tuned diffusion models, which can degrade output quality during inference; establish theoretical guarantees and practical remedies.

Method: The authors characterize the reward gap theoretically, deriving non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models and sharper convergence rates for VE/VP Gaussian models. They use the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) to enable arbitrarily high stochasticity while preserving data marginals. Empirically, they evaluate on large-scale text-to-image models with denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and MixGRPO.

Result: They obtain non-vacuous reward-gap bounds and sharper convergence rates for VE/VP models. Empirically, reward gaps shrink as training proceeds, and higher-stochasticity SDE training improves ODE-sampling quality at inference.

Conclusion: The reward gap is both theoretically bounded and practically reducible; employing higher stochasticity during RLHF training, facilitated by gDDIM, aligns training and inference dynamics and enhances the quality of deterministic samplers in diffusion-model RLHF systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniGNN is an attention-based, multi-relational dynamic GNN for stock prediction that incorporates macroeconomic context via heterogeneous node/edge types and a global sector node, using GATs and Transformers to achieve robust shock propagation and improved performance, especially during COVID-19.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based finance models struggle to propagate macroeconomic shocks efficiently across a stock network; there is a need to incorporate macro context and a fast diffusion mechanism to improve robustness under macro shocks.

Method: Proposes OmniGNN: an attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN with heterogeneous node and edge types; introduces a sector node as a global intermediary to facilitate rapid shock propagation; uses Graph Attention Networks to weigh neighbor contributions; Transformers capture temporal dynamics across multiplex relations; trained and evaluated on public stock datasets; designed to be robust during macro shocks such as the COVID-19 period.

Result: OmniGNN outperforms existing stock prediction models on public datasets and demonstrates strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Conclusion: The sector node and heterogeneous relational design enable faster diffusion of shocks and more robust predictions, highlighting the value of incorporating macroeconomic context in dynamic GNNs for finance.

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

*Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Samuel Horváth,Aleksandr Beznosikov,Martin Takáč,Slavomir Hanzely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified optimization framework based on preconditioned matrix norms generalizes steepest descent, quasi-Newton, and adaptive methods, revealing SGD/Adam/Muon/KO-based hybrids as special cases; it analyzes affine/scale invariance and introduces two new methods, MuAdam and MuAdam-SANIA, with competitive empirical performance and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between adapting to problem geometry (first-order steepest descent) and exploiting curvature (quasi-Newton/adaptive methods) by moving beyond Frobenius geometry toward a unified preconditioned matrix-norm framework; to enable affine/scale invariance analysis in matrix-parameterized settings.

Method: Introduce preconditioned matrix norms to unify optimization algorithms. Show common optimizers (SGD, Adam, Muon, KL-Shampoo, SOAP, SPlus) as special cases within this framework. Perform theoretical treatment of affine and scale invariance under generalized norms with necessary/sufficient conditions. Propose two new methods, MuAdam and MuAdam-SANIA, combining Muon spectral geometry with Adam-style preconditioning. Validate via experiments and provide code release.

Result: Establishes a broad unifying framework linking diverse optimizers under preconditioned matrix norms. Delivers invariance theory with complete conditions and demonstrates that MuAdam variants are competitive with or surpass state-of-the-art methods in various settings. Code available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: The preconditioned matrix-norm framework offers a principled, extensible lens for optimization across architectures, enabling principled derivation of known optimizers and the design of new ones (MuAdam, MuAdam-SANIA). It advances understanding of affine/scale invariance in matrix-parametrized problems and shows practical performance gains in experiments.

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BioOSS: a bio-inspired oscillatory network with two neuron populations (p and o) that generate wave-like neural propagation. Trainable damping and speed enable adaptation to spatio-temporal tasks; shows superior performance and interpretability on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models rely on static perceptrons and fail to capture oscillatory, spatio-temporal neural dynamics observed in biological circuits, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. A wave-propagation based system could better model neural processing and provide interpretability.

Method: Two interacting populations: p neurons (membrane-potential-like units) and o neurons (control propagation velocity and lateral spread). Local interactions yield wave-like propagation; trainable parameters for damping and speed allow adaptation to task structure. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world tasks with comparisons to alternative architectures.

Result: BioOSS demonstrates superior performance and enhanced interpretability relative to alternative architectures on both synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: A biologically inspired oscillatory state system can capture spatio-temporal neural dynamics more effectively, offering flexible control over propagation and interpretability for PFC-like processing tasks.

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

TL;DR: Linear regression can outperform LSTM and Temporal Fusion Transformer for terrestrial water storage (TWS) prediction on the HydroGlobe dataset; emphasizes benchmarking and globally representative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether complex ML models consistently beat traditional statistics in hydrology despite natural variability and human modifications; highlights the need for proper benchmarks and representative datasets.

Method: Comparative evaluation of linear regression, LSTM, and Temporal Fusion Transformer on TWS prediction using HydroGlobe baseline (soil/land surface model only) and assimilated versions (with multi-source remote sensing data).

Result: Linear regression outperforms deep learning models (LSTM and TFT) for TWS prediction on HydroGlobe; DL models do not universally improve prediction, underscoring the importance of simple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traditional statistical models should be included as benchmarks in DL-based hydrology studies; globally representative benchmark datasets capturing natural variability and human interventions are essential for fair evaluation of ML models.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

*Javier García-Sigüenza,Mirco Nanni,Faraón Llorens-Largo,José F. Vicent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end graph pruning model learns to select essential nodes during training, improving explainability and preserving information in spatio-temporal graphs, demonstrated on traffic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable explainable, efficient pruning of spatio-temporal graphs and understand problem structure rather than just model behavior; address the separation of pruning from training.

Method: Integrate an optimized pruning mechanism into the training loop that jointly minimizes prediction error while selecting/removing nodes, enabling learning of the most relevant subset during training.

Result: The approach retains more information as the graph reduces in size than competing methods, indicating pruning can simplify spatio-temporal problems without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Pruning during training is a viable tool for simplifying spatio-temporal problems and identifying key graph elements, with potential for enhanced explainability.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

### [451] [Crisis-Aware Regime-Conditioned Diffusion with CVaR Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10807)
*Ali Atiah Alzahrani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A regime-conditioned diffusion framework (MARCD) with tail-weighted objectives and a regime-specialized Mixture-of-Experts denoiser improves risk-aware portfolio performance under regime shifts by generating tail-aware scenarios and solving a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph QP with governance; demonstrates superior out-of-sample Sharpe and drawdown management in extensive tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address regime shifts and tail risk in portfolio decisions by coupling scenario generation with governance and risk-control mechanisms (CVaR), enabling better decision making under crisis-like conditions.

Method: Infer latent regimes with a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model; train a diffusion model using a tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized MoE denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements; generate scenarios and feed them into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance to decide portfolios.

Result: In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration versus popular generators. Out-of-sample (2020-2025, monthly, ~10 bps) it achieves Sharpe 1.23 (benchmark 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3% (benchmark 14.1%), a 34% drawdown reduction with similar turnover. Bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5%. The work also provides theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the CVaR gap, plus oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator.

Conclusion: MARCD offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed portfolio decisions, delivering materially improved drawdown control and risk-adjusted performance under regime dynamics.

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AEGIS offers a scalable middleware to optimize data-masking configurations by estimating the feature-label joint distribution from limited summaries, enabling fast and privacy-preserving selection that preserves downstream ML utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In data-sharing ecosystems, many masking configurations yield different data utility under privacy constraints. There is a need for a fast, privacy-preserving method to pick the masking setup that maximizes predictive utility for ML tasks.

Method: AEGIS introduces a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation based on changes in feature-label correlations before and after masking. It uses iterative proportional fitting to estimate the joint distribution from limited data summaries (e.g., 1D histograms) or no raw data, enabling various correlation measures (g3, mutual information, chi-square) to quantify utility. The framework acts as middleware to identify optimal masking configurations.

Result: On real-world datasets, AEGIS identifies optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster than baselines, while the masked datasets achieve downstream predictive performance comparable to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: AEGIS provides a privacy-preserving, scalable solution for selecting masking configurations with flexible correlation quantification, achieving substantial speedups without sacrificing downstream ML performance.

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

### [453] [Glance for Context: Learning When to Leverage LLMs for Node-Aware GNN-LLM Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10849)
*Donald Loveland,Yao-An Yang,Danai Koutra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive node-aware fusion of GNNs and LLMs (GLANCE) selectively queries LLMs for nodes where GNNs falter, achieving strong overall performance and notable gains on heterophilous nodes while reducing cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform fusion of LLMs with GNNs yields small gains; need to identify per-node where LLMs help and infuse adaptivity; address scalability by limiting LLM calls.

Method: GLANCE framework: a lightweight router uses cheap per-node signals to decide whether to query the LLM; LLM refines GNN predictions; LLM calls are non-differentiable; router trained with advantage-based objective comparing LLM-augmented vs GNN-only utility.

Result: Benchmarks show GLANCE achieves best balance across node subgroups; up to +13% gains on heterophilous nodes; overall top performance; scalable due to selective LLM usage.

Conclusion: Adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM fusion is valuable; selective LLM invocation enables scalable deployment on large graphs and uncovers structural patterns where LLMs help.

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

*Aadithya Srikanth,Mudit Gaur,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First sample-complexity bound for discrete-state diffusion models: near O(ε^-2), with a structured score-estimation error decomposition (statistical, approximation, optimization, clipping) that guides efficient training and establishes theoretical tractability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete-state diffusion models are important for text, sequences, and combinatorial structures but lack rigorous sample-complexity theory. Existing analyses focus on score estimation error without addressing how many samples are needed to achieve a target accuracy, leaving theoretical guarantees and practical guidance missing.

Method: Develop a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state diffusion. Decompose the score estimation error into four components (statistical, approximation, optimization, clipping), and derive a sample complexity bound of ~O~(ε^-2) that ties together these error sources to provide guidance for efficient training.

Result: Derives the first sample complexity bound for discrete-state diffusion models, showing ~O~(ε^-2) sample efficiency. The error decomposition offers concrete insights into training requirements and sources of error.

Conclusion: Brings theoretical tractability and practical relevance to discrete-state diffusion, filling a fundamental gap and enabling more reliable use of these models in discrete domains.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

*Samuel Yuan,Divyanshu Saxena,Jiayi Chen,Nihal Sharma,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Jointly train cache replacement and prefetching policies using shared representations; two methods (joint encoder and contrastive embeddings) show promising preliminary results and outline a research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policies trained in isolation may underperform when combined in real hardware systems. Cache replacement and prefetching are bidirectionally interdependent; exploiting diverse features and historical trends is essential to adapt to workload dynamism and hardware changes.

Method: Develop shared representations for features used by both policies. Propose two approaches: (1) a joint encoder that feeds both policies; (2) contrastive learning to align and optimize embeddings reflecting cross-policy interdependencies. Train the policies jointly to capture interdependencies.

Result: Promising preliminary results for both joint-representation approaches, suggesting feasibility of joint training; not yet conclusive.

Conclusion: Advocates pursuing joint learning for interdependent system policies and outlines a research agenda exploring deeper joint training, evaluation across workloads, and scalability.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

### [456] [HeroFilter: Adaptive Spectral Graph Filter for Varying Heterophilic Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10864)
*Shuaicheng Zhang,Haohui Wang,Junhong Lin,Xiaojie Guo,Yada Zhu,Si Zhang,Dongqi Fu,Dawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive graph filtering is essential for graphs with varying heterophily; a proposed method AdaptiveHeteroGNN harnesses signals across the heterophily spectrum and uses adaptive mixing, yielding up to 9.2% accuracy gains on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practice often assigns fixed low-pass or high-pass filters based on a graph's homophily, but heterophily- filtering is not strictly monotonic with degree. The paper argues that the average frequency response and heterophily do not correlate monotonically, necessitating adaptive filters to preserve expressiveness and ensure generalization.

Method: Introduce AdaptiveHeteroGNN ([METHOD NAME]) that collects information across the heterophily spectrum and combines salient representations via adaptive mixing of frequency components.

Result: Empirical results show up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over leading baselines across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: Adaptive graph filters are required for robust generalization on graphs with varying heterophily. Fixed filter designs fail to capture spectrum-dependent signals, and the proposed adaptive approach effectively leverages heterophily diversity to improve performance.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient uniqueness is a principled, general privacy metric for ML model disclosures; a simple monitoring defense can achieve privacy comparable to DP-SGD with better utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disclosing ML models raises privacy risk; need a general, architecture-agnostic metric to quantify and audit potential information leakage from models.

Method: Derive an upper bound on information leakage to obtain a gradient-uniqueness metric; propose monitoring gradient-uniqueness as a defense; compare with DP-SGD; evaluate on privacy and utility.

Result: The metric provides a practical disclosure bound; the monitoring defense achieves privacy comparable to DP-SGD while preserving higher testing accuracy (utility).

Conclusion: Gradient uniqueness is a general, actionable privacy auditing tool for ML models; monitoring it offers competitive privacy guarantees with improved utility over traditional DP-based methods.

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPCVAE enhances TSAD by fusing long-term time dependencies (via LSTM) with probabilistic time-frequency information (via Product-of-Experts) in a Conditional VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results on four public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE-based TSAD methods rely on single-window features and underutilize long-range temporal and frequency information, limiting detection robustness.

Method: Introduce a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion (LPCVAE). Use LSTM to capture long-range dependencies beyond single windows and a Product-of-Experts mechanism for adaptive, distribution-level fusion of time-frequency representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public datasets show LPCVAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating long-term temporal dynamics with adaptive time-frequency fusion improves TSAD, mitigating information loss and yielding a robust solution.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

TL;DR: PerSyn personalizes synthetic data synthesis by routing prompts to the best teacher, improving student learnability and efficiency compared to Generate-then-Select.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stronger teacher models do not always yield better teaching due to misalignment between teacher outputs and student learnability; there is a need for data crafted for each student.

Method: Use a route-level router to assign prompts to an optimal teacher considering both learnability and teacher response quality; each teacher synthesizes data only for its assigned prompts, avoiding full parallel generation across all teachers.

Result: PerSyn achieves superior or comparable performance to baselines across model families and scales in instruction tuning and math reasoning tasks; analyses validate effectiveness and offer additional insights.

Conclusion: Personalized data synthesis via per-prompt routing is an effective, efficient distillation strategy with potential to guide future research on teacher–student data synthesis.

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neutral agent-based adversarial policy learning approach enables indirect attacks on well-trained victim RL agents in multi-party open systems by influencing the shared environment, without direct interaction or full environment control, shown effective on StarCraft II SMAC and Highway-env.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge: In multi-party open systems, existing adversarial attacks either require direct interaction with victim agents or full control of the environment, which is often impractical. There is a need for attacks that operate via shared environments without direct access to victims.

Method: Introduce neutral agents that are detached from victim agents but influence them indirectly through the shared environment. Train adversarial policies for these neutral agents across various multi-party scenarios. Evaluate on SMAC (StarCraft II) and Highway-env to demonstrate generality and effectiveness.

Result: The experiments show that the neutral-agent adversarial approach can launch general and effective attacks across different task scenarios in multi-party open systems.

Conclusion: Neutral-agent policy learning provides a practical, generalizable way to conduct adversarial attacks in open multi-agent environments without direct interaction with victims or full environmental control, highlighting security implications for DRL in multi-party settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

*Yuda Bi,Ying Zhu,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified geometric theory of redundancy for finite/structured information, unifying MI, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy; predicts an optimal redundancy balance and validates via masked autoencoder experiments showing peak generalization at a stable redundancy level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend information theory to finite and structured systems by treating redundancy as a fundamental organizational property, unifying classical measures under a single redundancy geometry and addressing the limits of minimal redundancy in learning contexts.

Method: Define redundancy as a family of informational divergences forming a geometric projection that subsumes mutual information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy; derive upper and lower bounds, and an equilibrium balancing over-compression and over-coupling; validate with masked autoencoder experiments to observe redundancy levels and corresponding generalization.

Result: Redundancy maps to a shared geometry; it is bounded above and below; maximal stability and generalization occur near the predicted equilibrium; masked autoencoder experiments exhibit a stable redundancy level where generalization peaks.

Conclusion: Redundancy is a measurable, tunable quantity that links the asymptotic theory of communication with the finite realm of learning, offering guidance for designing systems with stability and generalization in mind.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDOH-based ML predicts cognitive performance in a Mexican aging cohort; uses SVD-imputation and XGBoost with SHAP for interpretation; flooring material emerges as a notable predictor, highlighting SES/environmental disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease is irreversible; early detection via social determinants of health (SDOH) can enable prevention and equitable resource allocation. The study leverages Mex-Cog MHAS data to predict cognitive performance and identify high-risk individuals.

Method: Dataset: target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven domains from MHAS waves (2016, 2021). Predictors span demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare access factors. Missing data: SVD-based imputation with separate handling for continuous and categorical variables. Modeling: XGBoost chosen for predictive performance. Evaluation: performance surpasses existing methods and leaderboard; interpretation via SHAP to identify top SDOH contributors and age-specific patterns.

Result: The framework achieved superior predictive performance compared with existing methods, demonstrating accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. SHAP analysis highlighted key SDOH factors (e.g., flooring material) and age-specific patterns in feature importance. The model underscores the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and the value of interpretable SDOH modeling.

Conclusion: SDOH-driven, interpretable machine learning can effectively predict cognitive performance and reveal social/environmental risk factors (notably flooring as a socioeconomic proxy). The approach supports early risk stratification, targeted prevention, and equitable resource planning across aging populations, with implications for policy and public health.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

### [463] [Rediscovering Entropy Regularization: Adaptive Coefficient Unlocks Its Potential for LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10959)
*Xiaoyun Zhang,Xiaojian Yuan,Di Huang,Wang You,Chen Hu,Jingqing Ruan,Kejiang Chen,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER) dynamically tunes exploration in RLVR, addressing entropy collapse and robustness across tasks; it improves reasoning accuracy in mathematical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy entropy collapse in RLVR reduces exploration, and fixed entropy coefficients are brittle across tasks/models; adaptive method aims to maintain moderate entropy levels aligned with task difficulty.

Method: AER consists of: (1) difficulty-aware coefficient allocation; (2) initial-anchored target entropy; (3) dynamic global coefficient adjustment, to balance exploration/exploitation during training.

Result: Empirical results on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks show AER outperforms baselines in reasoning accuracy and exploration capability, across different models.

Conclusion: Adaptive entropy regularization is a promising approach to stabilize RLVR training and enhance reasoning by maintaining effective exploration tailored to task difficulty.

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

### [464] [MC#: Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10962)
*Wei Huang,Yue Liao,Yukang Chen,Jianhui Liu,Haoru Tan,Si Liu,Shiming Zhang,Shuicheng Yan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC# combines static mixed-precision quantization and online dynamic pruning to compress mixture-of-experts models for LLMs/VLMs, achieving substantial weight and activation reductions with minimal accuracy loss on multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models scale capacity but incur large storage, loading, and runtime costs due to loading all experts and activating many per token. Efficient deployment requires reducing both memory and compute with minimal accuracy loss.

Method: PMQ (Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization) uses linear programming to allocate per-expert bit-widths by balancing expert importance and quantization error for Pareto-optimal size/performance. OTP (Online Top-any Pruning) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained, runtime-efficient routing. Combining static PMQ with dynamic OTP yields aggressive compression and controlled accuracy loss.

Result: On DeepSeek-VL2, MC# achieves 6.2x weight reduction with an average of 2.57 bits per parameter and only 1.7% accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. OTP reduces expert activation by over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation.

Conclusion: The proposed MC# framework demonstrates strong Pareto-efficient compression for MoE-based LLMs/VLMs, enabling substantial model size and runtime reductions with minimal accuracy loss, and shows promise for practical deployment of MoE architectures.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

*Zhuo Li,Yuege Feng,Dandan Guo,Jinpeng Hu,Anningzhe Gao,Xiang Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive margin for BT-based Reward Models via distributional OT improves discrimination of similar preferences, enhancing ID and OOD generalization and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BT-based reward models often fail to distinguish between similar responses, overfit easy samples, and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution data. An enhanced mechanism is needed to improve discrimination and generalization.

Method: Introduce an adaptive margin in the Bradley-Terry reward model guided by semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, designed via an Optimal Transport-based cost matrix to capture distributional differences between chosen and rejected responses.

Result: Across benchmarks, the method improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, accelerates convergence, and enhances generalization; RLHF experiments indicate practical effectiveness; code released.

Conclusion: Adaptive margin with OT-guided cost design strengthens BT-based reward models, yielding better separation of preferences, faster training, and improved alignment of LLMs with human preferences.

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

*Junhyuck Kim,Ethan Ewer,Taehong Moon,Jongho Park,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization memory-optimality for reasoning LLMs depends on model scale and KV cache effects; small reasoning models benefit from more weights, while large ones benefit from longer generation; memory optimization must be scale-aware rather than universal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memory layout (weights vs cache) affects accuracy and throughput for reasoning models, and to derive deployment guidelines distinguishing reasoning from non-reasoning models.

Method: Systematic experiments over 1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, comparing 4-bit weight quantization versus KV-cache usage, varying model size and generation length, and evaluating when KV cache eviction outperforms quantization and when parallel scaling is memory-efficient.

Result: There is a scale-dependent trade-off: sub-8-bit effective models achieve higher accuracy by allocating memory to more weights (smaller generation), while larger models gain from longer generations. A memory-efficiency threshold governs when parallel scaling helps and whether KV-cache eviction beats KV-quantization. Overall, memory optimization for LLMs is not scale-agnostic.

Conclusion: Memory optimization for reasoning models should be tailored to model scale. For small reasoning models, prioritize increasing model capacity; for larger models, prioritize increasing test-time compute (generation length). These findings imply deployment strategies for reasoning models differ fundamentally from non-reasoning models and motivate adaptive, scale-aware quantization and caching policies.

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

*Hongkai Zheng,Austin Wang,Zihui Wu,Zhengyu Huang,Ricardo Baptista,Yisong Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Blade uses diffusion-model priors with an interacting-particle ensemble to perform derivative-free Bayesian inversion, yielding accurate, well-calibrated posteriors and non-asymptotic convergence; outperforms existing derivative-free methods on nonlinear problems including fluid dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many science and engineering problems, the forward model is expensive or inaccessible to derivatives, making traditional Bayesian inversion impractical. There is a need for methods that provide accurate, calibrated posteriors without requiring gradient information, and for theoretical guarantees when priors are learned from data (e.g., diffusion models).

Method: Introduce Blade, an algorithm that maintains an ensemble of interacting particles to perform Bayesian inversion without derivatives. It uses diffusion-model-based priors to encode rich, data-driven structure and can handle black-box forward models. The paper proves non-asymptotic convergence results describing how forward-model and prior estimation errors affect the posterior, and demonstrates the method on diverse nonlinear inverse problems, including challenging fluid dynamics.

Result: Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods, delivering accurate and well-calibrated posteriors even for highly nonlinear forward models.

Conclusion: Blade provides a principled, effective framework for derivative-free Bayesian inversion that combines diffusion-model priors with an interacting-particle scheme, supported by non-asymptotic theory and strong empirical results on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical, information-geometric framework quantifies SSL representation efficiency via the Fisher Information Matrix; shows Barlow Twins attains optimal efficiency (η=1) by decorrelating representations to identity, yielding an isotropic FIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL lacks a unified theory to compare representation efficiency across paradigms. A geometric, information-theoretic measure ties encoding structure to statistical manifold properties.

Method: Define representation efficiency η as the ratio of the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space to its ambient dimension, computed from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the encoders' statistical manifold. Analyze Barlow Twins under natural assumptions, showing its cross-correlation matrix approaches the identity, which induces an isotropic FIM and η=1.

Result: Under the stated assumptions, Barlow Twins achieves η=1, i.e., optimal representation efficiency; the cross-correlation alignment leads to an isotropic FIM and a principled justification for its success.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous, geometric foundation for understanding SSL efficiency and offers a framework to analyze other SSL methods through information geometry and FIM-based dimensionality notions.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-transferable examples (NEs) are a training-free, data-agnostic input transformation that makes data usable for authorized models while diminishing performance on unauthorized ones by recoding inputs into a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace, thus delaying or preventing misuse by unknown models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulations seek data that remains useful for innovation yet resistant to misuse. Existing methods perturb data or retrain models, but neither guards against inference by unknown models or transfers without training control. A training-free, data-agnostic mechanism is needed.

Method: Recoding inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace to preserve outputs for the authorized model while causing misalignment for unauthorized models. The approach is training-free and data-agnostic, relying on subspace transformations with bounds derived from spectral differences (Hoffman-Wielandt inequality).

Result: The authors establish formal utility bounds for the authorized model and quantify degradation for unauthorized models. Empirically, NEs preserve performance across diverse vision backbones and vision-language models under common preprocessing, while non-target models collapse even with reconstruction attempts.

Conclusion: NEs offer a practical means to preserve intended data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. The project is available at the provided URL.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

TL;DR: InstructUE presents an instruction-aware user embedding model built on an LLM foundation, using a multi-encoder architecture and a contrastive-autoregressive training framework with a UserQA dataset to achieve generalizable, noise-robust embeddings across domains for user prediction, marketing, and recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current user representation methods struggle with cross-domain generalization and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. There is a need for instruction-aware embeddings that can leverage language models to denoise data and transfer knowledge across tasks.

Method: A multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter processes heterogeneous data from six sources while preserving structure. A novel contrastive-autoregressive training framework bridges language and representation spaces using a curated UserQA dataset, combining autoregressive language modeling with contrastive alignment of user-text embeddings.

Result: Empirical evaluations show InstructUE outperforms existing methods across user prediction, marketing, and recommendation tasks, demonstrating improved instruction-awareness and robustness to noise. The approach enables instruction-guided denoising of user information in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: Instruction-aware user modeling via an LLM-backed foundation with dual training (autoregressive + contrastive) yields more generalizable and robust user representations across domains, suggesting broader applicability in personalized systems.

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user

*Pranav Ramesh,Arjun Roy,Deepak Ravikumar,Kaushik Roy,Gopalakrishnan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EasyCore uses average input gradient norm (AIGN) to identify and retain easy samples for training, improving adversarial robustness over existing coreset methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coreset methods currently optimize clean accuracy and neglect robustness; a data-centric approach is needed to preserve robustness during subset training.

Method: Compute AIGN for samples during training; rank by hardness; form a coreset of low-AIGN (easy) samples; train models under standard and TRADES adversarial training; compare to other coreset methods.

Result: Models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve higher adversarial accuracy; improvements up to 7% under standard training and 5% under TRADES vs existing coreset methods; AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property.

Conclusion: An AIGN-based hardness framework provides a practical, efficient, and broadly applicable data-centric method to boost adversarial robustness via coreset selection.

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

TL;DR: A graph-aware conformal prediction framework for sequential prediction on graph time series, yielding valid coverage with significantly smaller ellipsoidal prediction regions by exploiting graph structure to capture node dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide trustworthy uncertainty quantification for graph time series by jointly modeling temporal dynamics and graph topology, addressing limitations of prior CP methods that ignore either structure or dynamics.

Method: A CP-based sequential prediction region framework that leverages graph structure to model pairwise node dependencies, producing ellipsoidal prediction regions with coverage guarantees. The method integrates graph information into the conformal prediction procedure and proves an exponential reduction in region volume compared with graph-agnostic CP.

Result: Empirical studies on real-world graph time series show that the proposed framework maintains the target empirical coverage while achieving substantially smaller prediction regions (up to 80% reduction) relative to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach offers a principled, scalable uncertainty quantification tool for graph time series, combining coverage guarantees with markedly tighter predictive regions by exploiting graph topology; it broadens CP applicability to dynamic networked systems and invites further work on scalability and extensions to broader graph settings.

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: Temporal Alignment Guidance (TAG) uses a time predictor to estimate deviations from the data manifold at each diffusion timestep and applies a guidance mechanism to pull samples back toward the manifold, improving fidelity under guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from off-manifold errors that accumulate during generation, especially when arbitrary guidance is applied, leading to degraded sample fidelity. A general solution to keep generation aligned with the data manifold is needed.

Method: Introduce a time predictor to estimate distance from the desired data manifold at each timestep and implement Temporal Alignment Guidance (TAG) to steer samples toward the manifold at every diffusion step.

Result: TAG consistently yields samples that stay closer to the target manifold at each timestep and significantly improves generation quality across multiple downstream tasks, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Temporal Alignment Guidance provides a general, effective approach to mitigating off-manifold generation in diffusion models under guidance, enhancing fidelity and sample quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (DPNet) for PPG denoising using a Mamba-based backbone, enhanced by SI-SDR loss and an auxiliary HR predictor, achieving robust denoising while preserving heart rate accuracy on BIDMC data, outperforming traditional filters and existing neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals are frequently contaminated by noise and motion artifacts, which degrade reliability for downstream tasks like heart rate estimation. Preserving physiological information during denoising is essential for wearable health monitoring.

Method: DPNet, a Mamba-based temporal denoising backbone, incorporates SI-SDR loss to promote waveform fidelity and includes an auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides HR-based supervision. The model is trained with a combination of SI-SDR and HR-guided losses and evaluated on the BIDMC PPG dataset, comparing against conventional filtering and existing neural models.

Result: DPNet demonstrates strong robustness to both synthetic noise and real-world motion artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and prior neural models. It restores PPG signals effectively while maintaining HR accuracy, and the SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision provide complementary benefits.

Conclusion: The proposed SI-SDR–guided, HR-supervised DPNet shows promise for practical deployment in wearable healthcare systems, highlighting the importance of preserving physiological information during denoising and the potential for real-world applicability.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

*Yujie Zhao,Lanxiang Hu,Yang Wang,Minmin Hou,Hao Zhang,Ke Ding,Jishen Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AT-GRPO is an agent- and turn-wise on-policy RL framework tailored for multi-agent LLM workflows (MAS) that also includes a training system supporting both single- and multi-policy regimes; it yields large gains on planning, coding, and math tasks across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying on-policy RL to MAS with LLMs is underexplored and challenging because prompts vary by agent role and turn, breaking standard GRPO assumptions; a MAS-aware training stack is needed for effective rollouts and updates.

Method: Develops AT-GRPO: an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm designed for MAS and a companion training system that supports single- and multi-policy regimes; evaluated on game, planning, coding, and math tasks to demonstrate gains from MAS-aware on-policy RL.

Result: Significant performance gains: for long-horizon planning, accuracy rises from a baseline of 14.0–47.0% to 96.0–99.5%; coding tasks show average accuracy gains of 3.87–7.62%, and math tasks 9.0–17.93% improvements. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, overall improvements are demonstrated. The authors provide code and environments at the given GitHub URL.

Conclusion: AT-GRPO advances the state of on-policy RL in MAS-LMM settings by introducing a MAS-aware grouping algorithm and a versatile training stack capable of single- and multi-policy regimes, achieving substantial gains and releasing open-source resources.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

### [476] [Efficient Edge Test-Time Adaptation via Latent Feature Coordinate Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11068)
*Xinyu Luo,Jie Liu,Kecheng Chen,Junyi Yang,Bo Ding,Arindam Basu,Haoliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED: a forward-only, CMA-ES-based, single-instance test-time adaptation (TTA) method for edge devices that updates a compact latent-space vector while keeping the model frozen, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantial compute reduction (up to 63x) and real-world deployment on the Zynq-7020.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices have limited computation and face distribution shifts, making efficient, adaptable ML essential. Existing TTA methods rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. Gradient-free approaches exist but often trade off learning capacity or flexibility or impose architectural constraints. A more efficient, flexible, gradient-free TTA is needed.

Method:  TED uses forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal latent subspace, optimizing a compact low-dimensional vector via the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The base model parameters are frozen; adaptation occurs without backpropagation, keeping memory and compute overhead low. The latent vector update aligns the latent representation with the source latent distribution, enabling forgetting-free adaptation.

Result: TED achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification and keyword spotting tasks, evaluated on ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets, while reducing computational complexity by up to 63x. It also demonstrates practical feasibility by deploying on the Zynq-7020 platform.

Conclusion: TED provides a practical, scalable solution for real-world edge applications by delivering effective test-time adaptation with minimal resources, without backpropagation, and with strong performance and deployability on constrained hardware.

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

### [477] [Causal Disentanglement Learning for Accurate Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11084)
*Wonah Kim,Jeonghyeon Park,Dongsan Jun,Jungkyu Han,Sejin Chun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CDRL4AD, a causal disentangled representation learning framework for anomaly detection in multivariate time series, enabling time-varying causal discovery and root-cause analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unsupervised methods assume independence among variables; graph-based methods capture correlations but do not explicitly infer causal relationships across time, hindering interpretable anomaly detection.

Method: Construct a temporal heterogeneous graph encoding the causal process, disentangle latent factors corresponding to causal mechanisms, and use these representations for anomaly detection and root-cause analysis. Evaluate on real-world datasets, analyze hyperparameters, and provide a case study for expert diagnosis.

Result: CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in anomaly detection accuracy and root-cause analysis; the study includes hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, time complexity assessment, and a case study demonstrating practical utility for domain experts.

Conclusion: CDRL4AD offers an effective, interpretable framework for detecting anomalies and uncovering causal drivers in multivariate time series, aiding human experts in diagnosing root causes.

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

### [478] [PhysioME: A Robust Multimodal Self-Supervised Framework for Physiological Signals with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11110)
*Cheol-Hui Lee,Hwa-Yeon Lee,Min-Kyung Jung,Dong-Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysioME is a robust framework for handling missing modalities in physiological signals using multimodal self-supervised learning, a Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone, and a restoration decoder to reconstruct missing modalities, achieving consistent performance across missing-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal applications due to hardware constraints or motion artifacts, and current methods assume all modalities, leading to degraded performance when any modality is missing.

Method: (1) Multimodal self-supervised learning combining contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone to capture temporal dynamics of each modality; (3) Restoration decoder to reconstruct missing modality tokens to enable processing of incomplete inputs.

Result: Experimental results show high consistency and generalization across various missing modality scenarios, suggesting PhysioME can support clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data availability.

Conclusion: PhysioME provides a reliable tool for robust performance with missing data and has potential for real-world clinical decision support where data completeness cannot be guaranteed.

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

### [479] [Refining Hybrid Genetic Search for CVRP via Reinforcement Learning-Finetuned LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11121)
*Rongjie Zhu,Cong Zhang,Zhiguang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A small, fine-tuned LLM, guided by a curriculum-based RL framework and an operator cache, can surpass expert-designed crossover operators in a Hybrid Genetic Search for CVRP, generalizing to large instances and beating neuro-based and commercial LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the prevailing reliance on massive general-purpose LLMs for automated heuristic design in VRPs and explore whether a smaller, specialized LLM can achieve superior performance with careful fine-tuning.

Method: Propose RFTHGS, an RL framework that fine-tunes a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) in CVRP. It uses a multi-tier curriculum reward: first ensure compilable operators, then executable, then high-performing ones, plus an operator caching mechanism to discourage plagiarism and promote diversity.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM outputs crossover operators that significantly outperform expert-designed operators within HGS. The gains generalize from small-scale to large-scale CVRPs (up to 1000 nodes) and exceed performance of leading neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini).

Conclusion: Carefully RL-fine-tuned, domain-specialized, small LLMs can surpass traditional expert heuristics and even larger LLMs in VRP solver design, indicating potential for more efficient, scalable AI-designed optimization components.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

### [480] [Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection in Thermal Images via Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11128)
*Qiyi Tong,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lagomarsino,Kuanqi Cai,Marta Lorenzini,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLCM-KD with DIKD enables effective RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer decoupled from compression, achieving state-of-the-art facial landmark detection in thermal imagery with low compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal FLD suffers from scarce visual cues and a large modality gap with RGB. Conventional fusion/translation methods are expensive or introduce artifacts, hindering deployment.

Method: Introduce Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD) that separates RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression. Introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional, closed-loop distillation where the thermal student learns from RGB teacher features and the student's representations are fed back into the frozen teacher’s prediction head to enforce modality-invariant, semantically-aligned features.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on public thermal FLD benchmarks with significantly reduced computational overhead compared to prior cross-modal approaches.

Conclusion: DIKD enables robust, modality-invariant feature learning across RGB and thermal domains, and MLCM-KD provides an effective, efficient framework for accurate thermal FLD without the drawbacks of traditional cross-modal fusion or translation.

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

### [481] [Test-Time Adaptation by Causal Trimming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11133)
*Yingnan Liu,Rui Qiao,Mong Li Lee,Wynne Hsu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TACT identifies and trims non-causal components in representations during test-time adaptation by using causal-preserving data augmentations and PCA-based trimming of high-variance directions, improving robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts cause models to rely on non-causal features; test-time adaptation should preserve causal signals while suppressing non-causal ones to improve target-domain performance.

Method: Apply causal-preserving data augmentations; compute representation variations via PCA to find high-variance, non-causal directions; trim representations by removing projections onto these directions; use trimmed features for prediction and adapt directions over time to refine non-causal feature estimates; provide theoretical analysis.

Result: Empirically validated on real-world OOD benchmarks; TACT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: Removing non-causal components through causal trimming during test-time adaptation is effective and theoretically justified, yielding improved robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

### [482] [DUAL: Learning Diverse Kernels for Aggregated Two-sample and Independence Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11140)
*Zhijian Zhou,Xunye Tian,Liuhua Peng,Chao Lei,Antonin Schrab,Danica J. Sutherland,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diversity-aware kernel aggregation framework for two-sample and independence testing that mitigates redundancy among kernels by incorporating kernel covariance, plus a selection-inference procedure to balance kernel diversity with individual power, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel-based tests benefit from aggregating multiple kernels, but naive optimization tends to select highly similar kernels that capture overlapping information, reducing the benefit of aggregation. There is a need to explicitly promote diversity while preserving power, and to select a strong, diverse kernel subset for testing.

Method: Introduce an aggregated statistic that accounts for diversity via covariance between kernels. Propose a selection-inference framework to pick kernels with strong individual performance from a learned, diverse kernel pool, leveraging training information. Provide theoretical proofs of test power consistency and Type-I error control, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed statistics.

Result: The approach yields consistent tests with controlled Type-I error and asymptotically favorable power. Empirical experiments across benchmarks for both two-sample and independence testing show superior performance compared to existing single-kernel and naive aggregation methods.

Conclusion: Diversity-aware kernel aggregation with a selection-inference procedure effectively improves power while maintaining error control, offering theoretical guarantees and practical gains across standard kernel-based testing tasks.

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

*Mohammad Karami,Mostafa Jalali,Fatemeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular forecasting-based anomaly detection framework unifying classical and DL models, evaluated on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark; LSTM excels on complex patterns, Informer offers efficiency, classical methods good for simple data; forecasting quality drives detection performance; provides baselines and practical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic cross-domain evaluation in time series anomaly detection by unifying diverse forecasting models under a common residual-based detection interface and evaluating them comprehensively across a large, diverse benchmark.

Method: A modular pipeline with preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models (Holt-Winters, SARIMA, LSTM, Informer), four detection methods, and dual evaluation via forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE, PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). First complete evaluation on 58 Numenta ANomaly Benchmark datasets (7 categories) with 232 training runs and 464 detection evaluations, reporting 100% success. Performance analyzed across dataset complexity and model type.

Result: LSTM achieved the best F1 (0.688) and ranked first/second on 81% of datasets, with an almost perfect correlation on complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer yielded competitive accuracy (F1: 0.683) with ~30% faster training. Classical methods reached perfect predictions on simple synthetic data at lower cost but achieved 2–3 points lower F1 on real-world data. Differences in detection performance (F1: 0.621–0.688) were smaller than differences across forecasting models (F1: 0.344–0.688), indicating forecasting quality dominates detection performance. The work provides evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data with resource constraints. Complete implementation and results establish baselines for future research.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a forecasting-based, modular framework can unify classical and deep-learning approaches for anomaly detection, deliver practical guidance across data regimes, and set baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

### [484] [Emergence of hybrid computational dynamics through reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11162)
*Roman A. Kononov,Nikita A. Pospelov,Konstantin V. Anokhin,Vladimir V. Nekorkin,Oleg V. Maslennikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) trained on identical decision tasks yield distinct emergent computation in recurrent neural networks: RL discovers hybrid attractor dynamics with fixed points for maintenance and quasi-periodic dynamics for evidence integration, while SL tends toward simple fixed-point solutions. RL induces a balanced, robust neural population through implicit regularization; this robustness and the observed dynamics correlate with task complexity and initialization. Overall, learning algorithm choice is a primary determinant of emergent computation, with RL uncovering sophisticated dynamical mechanisms beyond standard gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the learning paradigm (RL vs. SL) shapes the emergent dynamical strategies of RNNs on decision tasks, beyond architectural considerations, and to understand how such dynamics relate to robustness and performance.

Method: Train RNNs on identical decision-making tasks under RL and SL; perform systematic dynamical-systems analysis to characterize attractor landscapes (fixed points, quasi-periodic attractors) and evidence integration; examine neural population properties and robustness; investigate effects of weight initialization and task complexity on emergent dynamics.

Result: RL-trained networks spontaneously develop hybrid attractor architectures combining stable fixed points for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic attractors for flexible evidence integration; SL-trained networks converge to fixed-point-only architectures. RL also enforces functionally balanced neural populations via a form of implicit regularization, enhancing robustness. The prevalence of these dynamics is modulated by weight initialization and strongly correlates with performance gains, especially as task complexity increases.

Conclusion: The learning algorithm is a primary determinant of emergent computation in neural networks. Reward-based optimization autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less accessible to gradient-based optimization, offering mechanistic insights into neural computation and practical guidance for designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

### [485] [Beyond single-model XAI: aggregating multi-model explanations for enhanced trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11164)
*Ilaria Vascotto,Alex Rodriguez,Alessandro Bonaita,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the robustness of explainable AI (XAI) explanations by aggregating feature importance across multiple models (k-NN, random forest, neural networks) to enhance trust in high-risk applications; results are preliminary but promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI is critical for trust and governance in high-stakes settings. However, the robustness of explanations is often overlooked. Using ensemble-derived explanations may yield more stable and trustworthy insights by combining diverse model perspectives.

Method: Compute feature importance from multiple models (k-NN, Random Forest, Neural Networks) and aggregate them into a single, robust importance score to produce explanations; evaluate whether aggregation improves explanation stability and trust.

Result: Preliminary results suggest that aggregation-based explanations can increase the trustworthiness of the application while still leveraging the predictive power of multiple models.

Conclusion: Ensemble-based robustness in explanation methods shows promise for improving trust in high-risk AI; further validation across domains and rigorous robustness metrics are needed.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

### [486] [ELMO: Efficiency via Low-precision and Peak Memory Optimization in Large Output Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11168)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELMO enables fully Float8 training for extreme multi-label classification (XMC) with BF16/Float8 data, using Kahan summation and stochastic rounding; achieves large memory savings (3M labels trained in 6.6 GiB vs 39.7 GiB for SOTA) without accuracy loss, avoiding master weights and scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XMC tasks involve extremely large label spaces (hundreds of thousands to millions) that make the classification head a dominant resource consumer. Existing FP16/FP32 training can be unstable and memory-inefficient, and low-precision methods often keep higher precision in the classifier. There is a need for a uniform, fully low-precision training framework that reduces memory and compute bottlenecks while preserving accuracy.

Method: Propose ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models. Train entirely with BF16 and Float8 data types, employing Kahan summation to reduce numerical error and stochastic rounding to maintain stability. Eschew single-precision master weights and tensor scaling. Implement memory optimizations: gradient fusion and chunking to further reduce GPU memory usage.

Result: Demonstrates that XMC models can be trained entirely in Float8 without relying on master weights or scaling, with stable accuracy. Achieves substantial memory savings, enabling training of a 3-million-label model in 6.6 GiB compared to 39.7 GiB with the previous state-of-the-art method (Renee).

Conclusion: Fully low-precision training for XMC is feasible and yields major memory reductions while maintaining accuracy, suggesting a viable path for scalable training for extreme label spaces and potentially informing similar approaches in other large-head models.

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

*Daniel Scalena,Leonidas Zotos,Elisabetta Fersini,Malvina Nissim,Ahmet Üstün*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGer is a training-free generation method that uses token-wise entropy to branch only on high-entropy tokens, reallocating compute to harder instances, delivering better efficiency and higher Pass@k on reasoning benchmarks; can cut tokens by up to 65% when labels are available and improve Pass@k by up to 37% vs Full Parallel Sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning language models incur heavy compute to generate multiple candidate sequences; different prompts have varying complexity, so compute should be allocated more adaptively to explore reasoning paths where needed.

Method: Leverages token-wise entropy as a measure of uncertainty; branches to alternative reasoning paths only for high-entropy tokens; train-free, does not use labeled targets; reallocates saved budget to instances needing exploration; evaluated on open-source models and complex benchmarks (e.g., AIME 2025).

Result: Across models/benchmarks, achieves best efficiency-performance trade-off in reasoning length and Pass@k; when labels available, up to 65% token reduction and up to 37% Pass@k improvement vs Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: EAGer provides effective compute savings and performance gains without extra training, enabling more efficient reasoning with adaptive exploration of paths.

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tool-augmented LLM RL agent trained on mathematical problem solving generalizes across diverse reasoning domains through Tool Generalization RL (TGRL), enabling cross-domain transfer of tool usage and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited cross-domain generalization of tool-using RL agents, showing that skills learned in math problem solving transfer to complex tasks in other domains and achieving strong task performance and token efficiency.

Method: Introduce TGRL with (i) a standardized, domain-agnostic tool interface with consistent formatting and explicit termination; (ii) a dual-component reward system that promotes generalizable behaviors like tool efficiency and reasoning abstraction; (iii) an XML-based prompt template to separate thinking, tool calls, and responses, enabling modular, domain-invariant planning and multi-turn interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and effective cross-domain transfer of tool usage, highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning and achieving high task performance with favorable token efficiency.

Conclusion: Tool RL for LLM reasoning can generalize across domains when equipped with standardized interfaces, domain-agnostic incentives, and modular prompting; TGRL provides a practical framework for scalable cross-domain tool use and skill migration.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Treats protein sequences as a language for LLMs, enabling zero-shot understanding without training, using QA triples and a bilingual corpus; achieves notable gains and can outperform some specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decipher unseen protein sequences and limitations of task-specific adapters and supervision; leverage foundation models with minimal specialized training.

Method: Convert amino-acid sequences into a symbolic language; adaptively construct sequence-question-answer triples; curate a bilingual protein-QA corpus (79,926 instances); test across open-source LLMs and GPT-4 in zero-shot.

Result: Consistent gains across diverse LLMs; up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (avg +7%); even outperforms some fine-tuned protein-specific models.

Conclusion: Generic LLMs can understand proteins when guided by protein-as-language cues, offering a scalable approach to protein understanding in foundation models.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

### [490] [Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202)
*Marco Pintore,Giorgio Piras,Angelo Sotgiu,Maura Pintor,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Detection Alignment (DA) to evaluate how well ML-based vulnerability detectors localize vulnerabilities, revealing biases from non-vulnerable lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current detectors often flag entire functions; localization is essential for debugging but is polluted by spurious correlations; need explainability-based evaluation.

Method: Introduce DA, a model-agnostic, explainability-based procedure that measures the agreement between the lines most influential for prediction and ground-truth vulnerable lines; apply across detectors/datasets.

Result: DA reveals that detector predictions are consistently biased by non-vulnerable lines; biases and spurious correlations substantially affect localization performance.

Conclusion: DA provides a practical framework for auditing localization quality and biases in vulnerability detection; emphasizes accounting for biases and offers code availability for reproducibility.

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of standard parallel reservoir models in capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics by integrating coarse-to-fine inputs and cross-layer interactions.

Method: A multi-layer reservoir computing architecture that ingests inputs across coarser to finer resolutions and couples layers crosswise to share information, applied to Sea Surface Temperature data for long-horizon forecasting; compared against standard parallel reservoir models.

Result: The proposed cross-layer, multi-resolution reservoir outperforms standard parallel reservoirs in long-term forecasting on SST data; cross-layer coupling yields improved predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Optimal dynamics in each layer trend toward more linear behavior, indicating the slow modes are propagated through the network layers, validating the multi-resolution cross-layer approach.

Abstract: We propose a new reservoir computing method for forecasting high-resolution
spatiotemporal datasets. By combining multi-resolution inputs from coarser to
finer layers, our architecture better captures both local and global dynamics.
Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel
reservoir models in long-term forecasting, demonstrating the effectiveness of
cross-layers coupling in improving predictive accuracy. Finally, we show that
the optimal network dynamics in each layer become increasingly linear,
revealing the slow modes propagated to subsequent layers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProjNet is a Graph Neural Network framework that enforces input-dependent constraints via sparse vector clipping and the CAD algorithm, with convergence guarantees, GPU acceleration, and a surrogate gradient for end-to-end training, applicable to LPs, non-convex QPs, and radio power optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many ML applications require outputs satisfying complex, dynamic constraints, and graph-structured data pose extra challenges due to variable output sizes. There is a need for scalable, trainable methods that can enforce constraints in GNNs.

Method: Combine sparse vector clipping with Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) to solve the best-approximation problem; prove convergence of CAD; implement a GPU-accelerated version; introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD to enable end-to-end training; validate on multiple constrained optimization problems.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across four problem classes: linear programming, two non-convex quadratic program families, and radio transmit power optimization; shows scalability to large-scale inputs and improved optimization friendliness via the surrogate gradient.

Conclusion: ProjNet provides a scalable, trainable approach for constraint-satisfying GNNs, combining a principled optimization solver with efficient gradients, suitable for diverse constrained problems.

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

*Jegwang Ryu,Minkyu Kim,Seungjun Shin,Hee Min Choi,Dokwan Oh,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NWC proposes a learned, autoencoder-based neural codec to compress LM weights, addressing variable tensor shapes and downstream-task accuracy, achieving competitive to state-of-the-art performance, especially at 4–6 bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently storing and transmitting very large language model weights is increasingly important, but traditional compression is manual and brittle due to weight diversity and the need to preserve downstream performance rather than pixel-like MSE.

Method: An autoencoder-based neural codec with three innovations: (1) column-wise tensor chunking and normalization to handle varied weight shapes; (2) an importance-aware training loss that aligns compression with downstream impact; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model outputs to correct reconstruction errors.

Result: On open-weight LMs, NWC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy–compression tradeoffs, notably strong performance at 4–6 bit precision with accuracy close to FP16 baselines.

Conclusion: Neural Weight Compression (NWC) is a viable learned compression framework for LM weights that leverages autoencoder codecs and targeted design choices to handle shape variability and task-specific evaluation, enabling efficient storage/transmission without substantial degradation at moderate-bit quantization.

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

TL;DR: SCGL is a principled method to learn connection graphs (CGs) from signals using maximum pseudo-likelihood with a spectral consistency constraint, jointly estimating topology, weights, and geometry via a Riemannian-manifold block-optimizer, yielding better topological and geometric accuracy and good efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover structure and geometry of connection graphs directly from observed signals, addressing the inverse problem in CGs where topology must be inferred while enforcing global geometric consistency through spectral properties.


Method: Formulates learning as maximum pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption tying the connection Laplacian to the combinatorial Laplacian. Introduces Structured Connection Graph Learning (SCGL), a block-optimization algorithm on Riemannian manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric structure.

Result: SCGL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The paper provides a principled framework and scalable algorithm for learning CGs from signals, achieving accurate reconstruction of both network topology and geometric structure, demonstrated via empirical improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: A fast semi-supervised graph embedding framework that jointly optimizes three objectives to produce high-quality node embeddings for node classification, achieving SOTA-like accuracy with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world graphs, nodes lack informative feature vectors; only neighborhood connectivity and labels are available signals. Effective classification requires embeddings that capture structural roles and topological context.

Method: Jointly optimize three objectives: (i) unsupervised structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii) semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity; unified into a single iterative optimization scheme.

Result: On standard benchmarks, the method achieves classification accuracy at parity with or better than state-of-the-art approaches, while significantly reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed fast semi-supervised embedding framework yields high-quality node embeddings for graph-based classification with improved efficiency, making it practical for large-scale graphs.

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

TL;DR: Self-supervised auto-encoders learn latent representations from unlabeled clinical data to handle missing values and data heterogeneity, then train a classifier on the latent space to predict cardiovascular death in ischemic heart disease patients; shows improved balanced accuracy over raw-data classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited labeled data and heterogeneous clinical data with missing values; exploit unlabeled data to build robust representations for prediction.

Method: Train a self-supervised auto-encoder on unlabeled clinical data to learn a latent embedding; then train a neural network classifier on the latent representations to predict cardiovascular death; evaluate on ischemic heart disease dataset; compare against a classifier trained on raw data.

Result: Classifier on latent space achieved higher balanced accuracy than classifier on raw data, indicating better handling of class imbalance and data heterogeneity; benefit grows with more unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Self-supervised auto-encoders are a promising approach for clinical predictive tasks with limited labels and missing data, enabling leveraging unlabeled data to improve performance in ischemic heart disease outcomes.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

*Jianzhe Zhao,Hailin Zhu,Yu Zhang,Ziqi Chen,Guibing Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fine-grained federated LoRA tuning framework that separates directional (A) and magnitude (B) vectors for shared vs. personalized knowledge, using a global-local optimizer mix to mitigate client drift and improve both global generalization and local adaptation in heterogeneous data; shows modest gains on LLama2/Deepseek models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning with heterogeneous data suffers from client drift; while LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning, lack of fine-grained analysis of LoRA matrices limits performance; there is a need to tailor updates to shared vs. personalized knowledge.

Method: Diagnose sensitivity of LoRA matrices; fine-tune sensitive directional vectors in A (shared knowledge) and magnitude vectors in B (personalized knowledge); employ a pipeline combining global and local optimizers to coordinate updates across clients.

Result: Empirical results on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B show improvements in global performance by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Conclusion: Fine-grained LoRA adjustments in federated fine-tuning can enhance both global generalization and client-specific adaptation under heterogeneous data conditions.

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

*Gareth Seneque,Lap-Hang Ho,Nafise Erfanian Saeedi,Jeffrey Molendijk,Ariel Kupermann,Tim Elson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENIGMA introduces an information-geometric framework for LLM training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment, and robustness by steering training along policy-informed directions on the model's information manifold. It uses a single-loop trainer combining GRPO (on-policy, critic-free RL with CoT-format rewards only), a SAMI-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary, and an entropic Sinkhorn regulariser on hidden-state distributions. The approach also defines infoNCE-based metrics, including a Sufficiency Index (SI), to predict downstream performance and select principles. In 1B LLM experiments, high-SI principles yield steadier training and better benchmarks than GRPO ablations, and an information-geometry analysis shows desirable manifold changes. The authors claim a single information-geometric objective underlies reasoning, alignment, and robustness and that ENIGMA enables principled reasoning without a reward model, suggesting a path to trusted capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to unify reasoning, alignment, and robustness in LLMs by framing organisational policies as directions on the model's information manifold, enabling principled regulation of learning dynamics and reduced reliance on external reward models. They also seek to quantify how CoT encodes policies via MI bounds and to pre-select guiding principles using a Sufficiency Index.

Method: A single-loop trainer that combines GRPO (on-policy, critic-free RL with CoT-only rewards), a SAMI-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary for mutual information estimation, and an entropic Sinkhorn regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. The approach introduces infoNCE-based metrics that reduce to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives, including a Sufficiency Index (SI) for principle selection. Evaluations are conducted on small 1B LLMs.

Result: High-SI principles lead to steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. An information-geometry analysis of trained models indicates desirable structural changes in the information manifold.

Conclusion: Reasoning, alignment, and robustness may be projections of a single information-geometric objective. ENIGMA-trained models reportedly achieve principled reasoning without a reward model, suggesting a path to trusted capability.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

### [499] [Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11282)
*Ning Yang,Hengyu Zhong,Haijun Zhang,Randall Berry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Framing spatiotemporal traffic forecasting as a vision-language task, ST-Vision-LLM uses a Vision-LLM image encoder and tokenized numeric data with two-stage fine-tuning (SFT then GRPO) to achieve strong cross-domain and long-term prediction performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, scalable spatiotemporal traffic forecasting in dense urban networks is essential for proactive resource management. LLMs struggle with spatial dependencies and dense grid data, necessitating an efficient, generalizable approach.

Method: Process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences via a Vision-LLM visual encoder; encode floating-point values into tokens with a custom vocabulary; two-stage fine-tuning (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization) to optimize predictive accuracy with memory efficiency.

Result: ST-Vision-LLM outperforms baselines by 15.6% in long-term predictions and exceeds the second-best baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, with strong generalization in data-scarce environments.

Conclusion: Recasting spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem yields strong predictive accuracy and cross-domain generalization, offering an efficient, scalable framework for dense urban traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best

*Antoine Mouchamps,Arthur Malherbe,Adrien Bolland,Damien Ernst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gym-TORAX is a Python package that wraps TORAX to create RL-ready, Gymnasium environments for simulating tokamak plasma dynamics and control. Users specify control actions, observations, and a reward-based objective; the package currently provides an ITER ramp-up scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reinforcement learning (RL) research in plasma control by offering a configurable, physics-based simulator interface that integrates TORAX with Gymnasium, making it easier to develop and compare RL strategies.

Method: Define a control action space, observation space, and objective rewards; Gym-TORAX generates a Gymnasium environment that wraps TORAX to simulate plasma dynamics and compute rewards, compatible with standard RL libraries; includes at least one ready-to-use environment based on ITER ramp-up.

Result: A ready-to-use RL environment instance that integrates TORAX with Gym-TORAX; currently one available environment based on the ITER ramp-up scenario, enabling RL experimentation in plasma control.

Conclusion: Gym-TORAX provides a practical bridge between physics-based plasma simulators and RL research, offering a configurable, RL-friendly interface to TORAX with an ITER ramp-up scenario and potential for additional environments in the future.

Abstract: This paper presents Gym-TORAX, a Python package enabling the implementation
of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments for simulating plasma dynamics and
control in tokamaks. Users define succinctly a set of control actions and
observations, and a control objective from which Gym-TORAX creates a Gymnasium
environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective
is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma
and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as
performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then
compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate
RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is
readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

### [501] [LouisKV: Efficient KV Cache Retrieval for Long Input-Output Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11292)
*Wenbo Wu,Qingyi Si,Xiurui Pan,Ye Wang,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV is an efficient KV cache retrieval framework for long-sequence auto-regressive tasks, achieving up to 4.7x speedup with near-lossless accuracy by leveraging semantic-boundary retrieval, temporal locality, and input/output-aware retrieval units plus kernel optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caches reduce redundant computations but incur memory overhead. Existing KV retrieval methods still suffer from per-token retrieval and coarse-grained, page-level KV management, which hurts efficiency and accuracy in long-sequence or long-reasoning scenarios. Efficient KV retrieval is increasingly important for large reasoning models.

Method: The paper makes two key observations: (1) critical KVs exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs have distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output. Building on this, LouisKV proposes: a semantic-aware retrieval strategy that triggers retrieval only at semantic boundaries to reduce computation and data transfer; a decoupled, fine-grained management scheme that uses differentiated strategies for input and output sequences to create retrieval units aligned with the model's attention; retrieval units tailored to identify critical KVs more precisely; kernel-level optimizations including custom Triton and CUDA kernels for KV clustering and retrieval.

Result: LouisKV achieves up to 4.7x speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks, including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input long-output scenarios.

Conclusion: LouisKV provides an efficient and accurate KV cache retrieval framework for long sequences by exploiting temporal locality and distribution patterns, with effective retrieval unit design and low-level kernel optimizations, enabling practical long-sequence reasoning.

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based time-series style transfer framework (DiffTSST) that disentangles content and style via encoders and reconstitutes them with a self-supervised, attention-guided diffusion process; enables conditional generation and boosts anomaly detection with data augmentation in scarce-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Style transfer for time series is underdeveloped compared to vision and language, hindering data augmentation and scenario simulation in data-scarce domains. There is a need for robust methods to separate content and style in time series to improve generalization.

Method: Propose DiffTSST: convolutional encoders disentangle content and style; a self-supervised, attention-based diffusion process recombines them. At inference, content and style are extracted from two Series to generate samples with a targeted style for transfer; trained in a self-supervised manner.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evidence shows effective style transfer. Data augmentation with DiffTSST improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: DiffTSST provides a viable diffusion-based approach to time-series style transfer, enabling conditional generation and practical gains in anomaly detection when data are limited.

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

### [503] [Event-Aware Prompt Learning for Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11339)
*Xingtong Yu,Ruijuan Liang,Xinming Zhang,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVP is an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can be plugged into existing dynamic graph neural networks to leverage historical events, improving representation learning. It demonstrates effectiveness on four public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic graphs evolve through events, and historical events carry valuable knowledge that is not fully captured by existing node-time or prompt-based methods. There is a gap in leveraging historical events to improve downstream tasks in dynamic graph learning.

Method: EVP extracts a sequence of historical events per node, introduces an event adaptation module to align event features with downstream tasks, and uses an event aggregation mechanism to integrate this historical knowledge into node representations. It is designed as a plug-in to existing DGNNs and prompt learning pipelines.

Result: Experiments on four public datasets show that EVP improves performance over baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of the event adaptation and event aggregation components and demonstrate compatibility with different DGNNs.

Conclusion: EVP offers a flexible plug-in to incorporate historical events knowledge into dynamic graph learning, enhancing performance and generalization. The approach can be extended to broader settings and could explore richer event types and efficiency optimizations.

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROLL Flash enables asynchronous RL post-training for LLMs, improving resource utilization and scalability over synchronous baselines, with substantial speedups while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronous RL post-training often suffers from underutilized resources and limited scalability when enhancing LLMs. The paper proposes ROLL Flash to extend ROLL with native asynchronous RL post-training.

Method: Two core design principles—fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling—drive a fully asynchronous training architecture with flexible interfaces, queue scheduling, and environment-level asynchronous execution. The system supports efficient rollout mechanisms and implements several off-policy algorithms.

Result: Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments show improved resource utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. Achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks using the same GPU budget. Asynchronous training attains performance on par with synchronous training.

Conclusion: Asynchronous RL post-training via ROLL Flash is effective and scalable, achieving substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance compared to synchronous training.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

### [505] [Multi-View Graph Feature Propagation for Privacy Preservation and Feature Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11347)
*Etzion Harari,Moshe Unger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MFP provides a privacy-aware enhancement to graph neural networks under sparse feature conditions by constructing multiple Gaussian-noised feature views, propagating them independently over the graph, and aggregating the results to yield robust node embeddings that preserve utility while reducing privacy leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs depend on abundant feature information; in real-world graphs features are often sparse or sensitive, causing performance drop and privacy risks; need a method that improves robustness to sparsity and protects privacy.

Method: Divide available features into several Gaussian-noised views; for each view perform feature propagation through the graph topology; aggregate multiple propagated representations into final node embeddings; analyze that outputs act as imputations rather than reconstructions; conduct sensitivity analysis.

Result: MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node classification under feature sparsity; substantially reduces privacy leakage; propagation outputs serve as imputations preserving utility; robust across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: MFP offers an effective, privacy-aware framework for graph learning in domains with missing or sensitive features, balancing utility and privacy while enhancing robustness to sparsity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

### [506] [Understanding the Generalization of Stochastic Gradient Adam in Learning Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11354)
*Xuan Tang,Han Zhang,Yuan Cao,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-layer over-parameterized CNNs show batch size and weight decay crucially shape Adam's generalization: mini-batch Adam/AdamW can reach near-zero test error while full-batch Adam converges to poor test error; Adam has a smaller effective weight decay bound than AdamW, explaining tougher λ tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between theory and practice by characterizing how stochastic batch size affects Adam's generalization, and why mini-batch Adam can outperform its full-batch counterpart.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Adam/AdamW on two-layer over-parameterized CNNs trained on image data; derivation of how batch size and weight decay influence generalization; comparison of effective weight-decay bounds; extensive experiments validating predictions.

Result: Mini-batch variants achieve near-zero test error; full-batch version yields poor test error; Adam's effective weight decay bound is strictly smaller than AdamW; results demonstrate critical role of batch size and weight decay.

Conclusion: Batch size and weight decay are central to Adam's generalization; results explain why Adam requires more sensitive λ tuning and provide guidance on setting batch size and weight decay for better generalization.

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

### [507] [Medical Interpretability and Knowledge Maps of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11390)
*Razvan Marinescu,Victoria-Elisabeth Gruber,Diego Fajardo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-model interpretability study of medical-domain knowledge in LLMs using four techniques (UMAP activation projections, gradient saliency, layer lesioning/removal, and activation patching) across five models. It maps where knowledge about patient age, symptoms, diseases, and drugs is stored, finds that most medical knowledge in Llama3.3-70B is processed in the first half of its layers, and reveals non-linear/non-monotonic patterns in age encoding and disease progression, with drug clustering by specialty rather than mechanism of action. Some models show activation collapse mid-network but recover later. The work suggests layer-targeted fine-tuning, un-learning, or debiasing strategies for medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover how medical knowledge is represented and processed in large language models, so that targeted interventions (fine-tuning, un-learning, debiasing) can be applied at appropriate network layers to improve medical reliability and reduce biases.

Method: Apply four interpretability techniques across five LLMs: (1) UMAP projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with respect to model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal, and (4) activation patching. Construct coarse-resolution knowledge maps for patient attributes (ages, symptoms, diseases, drugs) and analyze layer-wise storage and processing, with detailed observations for Llama3.3-70B and notes on Gemma3-27B / MedGemma-27B.

Result: Findings include: most medical knowledge in Llama3.3-70B is processed in the first half of the model; age is encoded in non-linear and sometimes discontinuous ways at intermediate layers; disease progression representation is non-monotonic and circular at certain layers; drugs cluster more by medical specialty than mechanism of action for Llama3.3-70B; Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B show activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by final layers.

Conclusion: These results can guide targeted interventions during fine-tuning, un-learning, or debiasing for medical tasks by indicating which layers are most relevant for different types of medical knowledge and biases.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

*Kahou Tam,Chunlin Tian,Li Li,Haikai Zhao,ChengZhong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHybrid reduces memory footprint in federated learning on mobile devices by jointly selecting participating clients and planning execution to fit memory budgets using a hybrid of recomputation and tensor-wise compression, including activation compression during local training. This yields substantial gains in accuracy and wall-clock time compared with baselines across memory budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory limitations on mobile devices hinder Federated Learning: devices are heterogeneous in memory, compute, and data distribution. The goal is to maintain or improve model accuracy and training progress while reducing memory usage and delay.

Method: 1) Per-round client selection considering memory budget, compute capability, and data diversity; 2) Construct an execution plan for each selected client by analyzing the computational graph to meet memory budgets while minimizing training delay using a hybrid of recomputation and compression tailored to each tensor; 3) During local training, apply activation compression to further memory reduction with minimal accuracy loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on both simulation and real mobiles show FedHybrid achieving up to 39.1% improvement in model accuracy and a 15.5x reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedHybrid effectively reduces memory footprint in federated learning on mobile devices without sacrificing, and in some cases improving, model accuracy, and significantly speeds up training. It demonstrates practical deployment potential and offers a concrete memory-accurate-train-time tradeoff framework for FL on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

TL;DR: A human-supervised, multi-LLM pipeline for systematic literature reviews using a consensus scheme and an open-source visual analytics interface (LLMSurver) to classify papers; it reduces manual effort and performs at or below the error rate of single annotators with open models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLRs are essential for mapping research domains but are labor-intensive due to large literature corpora and noisy keyword searches; there is a need for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective literature screening that leverages modern LLMs.

Method: A pipeline that uses multiple LLMs with descriptive prompts to classify papers and makes joint decisions via a consensus scheme. It is controlled interactively by a human-in-the-loop through an open-source visual analytics interface (LLMSurver), enabling real-time inspection and modification of outputs. Evaluation on ground-truth data from a large SLR (~8,000 candidate papers) comparing open and commercial LLMs from mid-2024 to fall 2025.

Result: The approach significantly reduces manual effort and yields lower error rates than a single human annotator. Modern open-source models are sufficient, making the method accessible and cost-effective.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that responsible human-AI collaboration can accelerate and improve SLR workflows in academic research, with open-source models enabling broad accessibility and cost savings.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WearECG uses a VAE to reconstruct twelve-lead ECGs from three leads (II, V1, V5); evaluates with MSE/MAE/FID and a cardiologist Turing test; further validates diagnostic utility by fine-tuning a pretrained ECG model (ECGFounder) on a 40+ condition multi-label task with real and synthetic signals; demonstrated on MIMIC data, showing potential for scalable, low-cost cardiac screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 12-lead ECGs are the clinical gold standard but lack portability, while three-lead wearables are limited in capturing pathologies in unmeasured regions; there is a need to enable portable, scalable cardiac screening by reconstructing full 12-lead data from partial measurements.

Method: Variational Autoencoder with architectural improvements to capture temporal and spatial ECG dependencies; reconstruct 12-lead ECGs from three leads II, V1, V5; evaluate generation quality with MSE, MAE, and Frechet Inception Distance (FID); assess clinical validity via a Turing test with expert cardiologists; fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions (including six MI locations) using both real and generated signals; validation on MIMIC dataset.

Result: The method yields physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust performance in downstream tasks; demonstrates potential for scalable, low-cost cardiac screening.

Conclusion: Generative modeling can enable accurate reconstruction of 12-lead ECGs from limited-lead data, supporting scalable and accessible cardiac screening and diagnosis.

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

*Sarthak Mittal,Divyat Mahajan,Guillaume Lajoie,Mohammad Pezeshki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for amortized learning across tasks, introducing a taxonomy that classifies methods into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, and proposing iterative amortized inference to scale learning to large datasets by refining solutions over mini-batches, bridging optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify diverse amortized learning approaches (meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers, etc.) under a single lens and address scalability bottlenecks caused by limited task-data processing at inference.

Method: Present a taxonomy separating methods based on how task adaptation is externalized/internalized/jointly modeled (parametric, implicit, explicit). Identify a key scalability limitation of current approaches. Propose iterative amortized inference that refines solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, inspired by stochastic optimization, connecting optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs.

Result: Provides a conceptual framework and a scalable inference approach. Bridges optimization-based meta-learning with forward-pass amortization, offering a scalable foundation for general-purpose task adaptation (work remains to be instantiated empirically in the abstract).

Conclusion: The proposed framework yields a scalable, extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation and highlights iterative amortized inference as a key path to scale to large datasets.

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and

### [512] [Differentiable Fast Top-K Selection for Large-Scale Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11472)
*Yanjie Zhu,Zhen Zhang,Yunli Wang,Zhiqiang Wang,Yu Li,Rufan Zhou,Shiyang Wen,Peng Jiang,Chenhao Lin,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable Top-K operator DFTopK achieves linear-time complexity O(n), avoiding sorting and gradient conflicts, enabling efficient end-to-end training in cascaded ranking; shows revenue lift in online tests and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Top-K is non-differentiable in cascade ranking, causing training inefficiencies and misalignment with objectives; existing differentiable sorting methods introduce gradient conflicts and are slower; a differentiable, fast Top-K operator is needed for scalable recommender systems.

Method: Introduce DFTopK by relaxing normalization constraints to obtain a closed-form differentiable Top-K solution with linear-time complexity, avoiding sorting and the gradient conflicts seen in differentiable sorting-based methods.

Result: Experiments show improved training efficiency and superior performance on the public RecFLow benchmark and an industrial system; online A/B yields a +1.77% revenue lift under the same computational budget; implementation is open-sourced.

Conclusion: First to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into recommender systems and to achieve theoretically optimal linear-time Top-K selection; DFTopK reduces gradient conflicts and enables scalable end-to-end training.

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

*Lion Mueller,Alberto Garcia-Ortiz,Ardalan Najafi,Adam Fuks,Lennart Bamberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rescale-Aware Training enables ultra-low-bit rescale multiplicands with negligible model quality loss, greatly reducing hardware rescaling cost in integer AI inference and enabling energy-efficient embedded deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integer rescaling in inference is a hardware bottleneck in integer-only AI; quantization-aware training (QAT) does not address the rescale cost; need hardware-aware quantization to reduce energy and latency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Quantize rescale multiplicands more aggressively post-training and introduce Rescale-Aware Training to fine-tune ultra-low-bit-width rescale factors; evaluate with experiments showing preserved accuracy with 8x reduced widths.

Result: Full accuracy preserved with minimal incremental retraining despite 8x narrower rescale multiplicands; reduced rescaling hardware cost; improved energy efficiency in embedded inference.

Conclusion: Rescale-Aware Training enables cost- and energy-efficient integer AI inference on resource-constrained devices; demonstrates that rescale operations can be quantized aggressively without harming performance; broad implications for hardware-aware quantization research.

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

### [514] [How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495)
*Nikolaos Tsilivis,Eran Malach,Karen Ullrich,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL after next-token training enables generalization on chain-of-thought parity tasks when long sequences are scarce; pure next-token struggles without abundant long demonstrations; results extend to Llama fine-tuning on math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze why reinforcement learning after pretraining improves performance over pure next-token prediction in autoregressive transformers, especially under mixture distributions of short and long chain-of-thought sequences and with longer test-time computation.

Method: Theoretical analysis of mixture distributions of short/long chain-of-thought sequences for a parity task, deriving conditions under which RL improves generalization; examination of autoregressive linear models under this training recipe; empirical validation via post-training of Llama-series models on math reasoning benchmarks.

Result: RL after next-token prediction enables generalization with rare long demonstrations, whereas pure next-token prediction requires large resources; longer test-time responses aid learning; in simplified models, efficient parity learning is possible when the fraction of long demonstrations is not exponentially small; observed in Llama-series post-training on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The RL-after-NTP training recipe helps overcome limitations of next-token-only training for iterative reasoning tasks under data constraints; provides theoretical and empirical support, suggesting practical guidelines on data mix and computation budget for reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

### [515] [ReLook: Vision-Grounded RL with a Multimodal LLM Critic for Agentic Web Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11498)
*Yuhang Li,Chenchen Zhang,Ruilin Lv,Ao Liu,Ken Deng,Yuanxing Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Wiggin Zhou,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook introduces a vision-grounded, agentic RL loop that uses a multimodal LLM as a visual critic and tool, plus a Forced Optimization rule to guarantee monotonic improvements; at inference, it decouples the critic to maintain latency, achieving strong gains in vision-grounded front-end code generation across three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well at algorithmic coding but struggle with front-end rendering correctness, which is judged pixel-by-pixel. There is a need for vision-grounded feedback, robust training routines, and mechanisms to avoid reward hacking and collapse in generation–diagnosis–refinement loops.

Method: An agent iteratively generates front-end code and uses a multimodal LLM in the loop as a visual critic and source of actionable feedback. A zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability. Forced Optimization restricts updates to improving revisions, ensuring monotonically better trajectories. During inference, the critic is decoupled, and a lightweight self-edit cycle runs without the critic to preserve latency.

Result: Across three standard benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong vision-grounded baselines on front-end code generation, demonstrating the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training–inference decoupling.

Conclusion: Vision-grounded, agentic feedback loops with a decoupled inference phase can substantially improve front-end code generation, offering robust renderability guarantees and competitive latency.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

### [516] [Offline Reinforcement Learning with Generative Trajectory Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11499)
*Xinsong Feng,Leshu Tang,Chenan Wang,Haipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unifying ODE-based view of generative policies leads to Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), delivering fast, high-performance offline RL, achieving state-of-the-art on D4RL and perfect scores on several AntMaze tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative policies suffer from a speed–performance trade-off: slow diffusion-based methods and fast but less capable single-step policies. A unifying continuous-time trajectory perspective promises better design and performance.

Method: Reframe diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models as learning a continuous-time ODE trajectory; propose Generative Trajectory Policies that learn the entire solution map of the ODE; introduce two theoretically principled adaptations to make GTPs practical for offline RL.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on D4RL; outperforms prior generative policies; achieves perfect scores on several hard AntMaze tasks.

Conclusion: The ODE-trajectory viewpoint clarifies the design space and enables a general, practical generative-policy paradigm for offline RL via GTPs.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

### [517] [Learning to Make MISTAKEs: Modeling Incorrect Student Thinking And Key Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11502)
*Alexis Ross,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MISTAKE builds synthetic incorrect reasoning data via cycle consistency with latent misconceptions and uses it to train models for student simulation, misconception classification, and answer/distractor generation, yielding improved simulation accuracy, miscons. inference, and distractor alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to model incorrect reasoning patterns in LMs for educational applications such as real-time student feedback, teacher training, and practice problems, since most work targets correctness; modeling errors can support simulation and diagnosis.

Method: Introduce MISTAKE: (1) generate synthetic errors by leveraging cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; (2) train models on this data for student simulation, misconception classification, answer generation, and distractor creation. Evaluate on three educational tasks.

Result: Higher accuracy in simulating incorrect answers tied to specific misconceptions; better inference of latent misconceptions from incorrect responses; better alignment with expert-written distractor answers for MC questions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that modeling incorrect reasoning patterns via synthetic data can enhance educational NLP tasks and support student modeling, with potential for broader impact and need for careful validation.

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

### [518] [Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning Models to Upscale Evapotranspiration in the U.S. Midwest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11505)
*Aleksei Rozanov,Samikshya Subedi,Vasudha Sharma,Bryan C. Runck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge-guided ML with remote sensing upscales ET across the Midwest; LightGBM with knowledge features achieves best validation, delivering a 500 m daily ET product (2019–2024) with strong agreement to state ET estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify evapotranspiration across broad areas and timescales beyond localized EC measurements; enable field-scale ET mapping for agricultural and land-atmosphere studies.

Method: Compared four tree-based models (Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM) and a simple feed-forward NN, all with knowledge-guided feature engineering; data from multispectral remote sensing, gridded meteorology, and EC towers; 5-fold grouped CV with site-year and biome stratification.

Result: LightGBM with knowledge-guided features performed best (R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2, MAE=8.82 W m^-2). Feature importance favored knowledge-guided features. Generated 500 m daily ET product for 2019–2024; high agreement with state-level weather-station ET estimates.

Conclusion: Knowledge-guided features are critical for accurate ET prediction; ML-based upscaling can produce a robust gridded ET product that aligns well with traditional ET estimates.

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

*Yuchen Yan,Zhihua Liu,Hao Wang,Weiming Li,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a graph-based, query-guided approach for multi-hop question retrieval to improve retrieval in RAG, using a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) and a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) with noise-robust training; shows strong gains, especially on high-hop questions (up to 33.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop questions in retrieval-augmented generation are challenging due to complex semantics and noise from retrieving multiple information targets. Existing methods struggle to understand questions with complex structures and are susceptible to irrelevant targets.

Method: Construct a Multi-L KG to capture information at different levels; design QSGNN with intra- and inter-level message passing where each message is guided by the query; pre-train QSGNN using two synthesized data generation strategies to improve robustness.

Result: Empirical results show the framework is effective for multi-hop retrieval, with particularly large gains on high-hop questions (up to 33.8%). Code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: A graph-based, query-aware representation learning approach on a multi-level knowledge graph significantly enhances multi-hop question retrieval for RAG, mitigating noise and improving high-hop performance; pre-training strategies bolster robustness.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, interpretable learning of expressive OWL classes on large KGs, while providing human-readable explanations and practical access to data via SPARQL.

expressions over large knowledge graphs. Ontolearn contains efficient
implementations of recent stateof-the-art symbolic and neuro-symbolic class
expression learners including EvoLearner and DRILL. A learned OWL class
expression can be used to classify instances in the knowledge graph.
Furthermore, Ontolearn integrates a verbalization module based on an LLM to
translate complex OWL class expressions into natural language sentences. By

### [521] [Diffusion-DFL: Decision-focused Diffusion Models for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11590)
*Zihao Zhao,Christopher Yeh,Lingkai Kong,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) models the distribution of uncertain parameters with a diffusion model and optimizes decisions via stochastic optimization; introduces a lightweight score-function estimator to avoid backprop through diffusion, achieving better decision quality than baselines; code available at the repo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic point predictions fail to capture real-world stochasticity; decision quality in DFL can improve if predictive models represent uncertainty; diffusion models provide flexible distributional modeling for this purpose.

Method: Represent uncertainty with a diffusion model; train with reparameterization to enable end-to-end diffusion training; alternatively, use a lightweight score-function estimator that requires only a few forward diffusion passes and no backprop through sampling; derive from weighted score function formulation to approximate gradients through stochastic optimization.

Result: Empirically outperforms strong baselines in decision quality; diffusion DFL is effective though the full backprop approach is memory/computation heavy; code available.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based DFL is a superior, practical approach to decision-focused learning under uncertainty; the proposed estimator makes it scalable; future work could explore further efficiency or applications.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

*Elliot L. Epstein,Rose Wang,Jaewon Choi,Markus Pelger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An Attention Factor framework for statistical arbitrage: learns conditional latent factors from firm characteristics to identify similar assets, extracts time-series signals from residuals, and jointly estimates factors and trading policy to maximize risk-adjusted returns after costs; achieves very high Sharpe in US equities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit temporal price differences and cross-asset similarity; establish that weak factors matter for arbitrage, and that joint learning improves profitability after trading costs.

Method: Learn Attention Factors via embeddings of firm characteristics to capture interactions; identify similar assets by factors; use a sequence model on residual portfolios to extract time-series signals; jointly estimate factors and arbitrage policy.

Result: Out-of-sample Sharpe > 4 on large-cap US equities over 24-year period; one-step solution Sharpe 2.3 net costs; demonstrates importance of weak factors.

Conclusion: Joint factor estimation and attention-based modeling enhances arbitrage profitability; weak factors play a significant role; method yields high risk-adjusted performance after costs.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

### [523] [MATH-Beyond: A Benchmark for RL to Expand Beyond the Base Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11653)
*Prasanna Mayilvahanan,Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo,Thaddäus Wiedemer,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MATH-Beyond (MATH-B) benchmark to reveal limitations of open-source models under large sampling; RL fine-tuning tends to sharpen existing solution modes rather than enabling genuinely new reasoning; MATH-B is designed to defeat 8B-parameter models at pass@1024 and spur exploration-driven RL for deeper reasoning; dataset released publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL fine-tuning for LLM reasoning often merely sharpens existing strategies on standard benchmarks, with large sampling allowing base models to solve many problems. This saturates benchmarks like MATH-500 and AIME 2024, hindering progress toward deeper, exploration-driven reasoning. A new benchmark is needed to force models to develop reasoning beyond their base capabilities.

Method: Construct MATH-Beyond from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR, ensuring problems challenge even strong open-source models at high sampling budgets. Evaluate base models and RL-finetuned models (e.g., Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview) on pass@1024 to assess whether RL can yield genuinely new reasoning.

Result: Base models with large sampling budgets already solve most questions on standard benchmarks; RL-finetuned models perform poorly on MATH-Beyond at pass@1024, indicating that existing RL approaches do not induce the deeper reasoning required by this benchmark; MATH-Beyond successfully defeats common open-source models under heavy sampling.

Conclusion: MATH-Beyond provides a testing ground to catalyze exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper, beyond-base capabilities. The dataset is released at HuggingFace and can drive research toward reasoning methods that go beyond mere sharpening of existing strategies.

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

### [524] [An Eulerian Perspective on Straight-Line Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11657)
*Panos Tsimpos,Youssef Marzouk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes dynamic measure transport via stochastic processes to identify when flows are straight-line (zero acceleration) and exactly integrable; it provides a PDE criterion, characterizes affine interpolants, and links straightness to deterministic endpoint couplings, offering design guidance for transport geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by generative modeling needs: to transport probability measures with dynamics, and to know when the resulting flow is tractable (straight-line) via first-order methods.

Method: Develops a PDE characterizing straightness as a balance between conditional acceleration and the divergence of a Reynolds (weighted covariance) tensor; analyzes affine-in-time interpolants; derives necessary conditions for general flows to guide design of easier-to-integrate transports.

Result: Characterization of straight flows via a PDE; affine-in-time interpolants are fully characterized and occur exactly with deterministic endpoint couplings; derives necessary conditions constraining flow geometry for general processes, providing design guidance for simpler transports.

Conclusion: The framework helps design transport mechanisms in generative modeling that yield simpler, more easily integrable flows, and clarifies when straight-line transports are possible based on endpoint coupling and flow geometry.

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

### [525] [Chronologically Consistent Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11677)
*Songrun He,Linying Lv,Asaf Manela,Jimmy Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces chronologically consistent, lookahead-bias-free LLMs trained only on pre-cutoff data, yielding a replicable, conservative forecast tool with fixed weights and a chat interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate lookahead bias and leakage from post-cutoff data to enable reliable evaluation of predictive signals in LLMs and provide a baseline framework for research.

Method: Train families of LLMs with strict temporal separation: data used for training is limited to pre-defined knowledge-cutoff date; models have fixed weights and a simple conversational chat interface; and the framework yields a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy that is free of training leakage.

Result: Provides a ready-to-use, lookahead-free generative AI tool with a chat interface, fixed weights for replicability, and a conservative accuracy bound; useful across prediction tasks and suitable as a baseline for researchers to isolate true predictive signal.

Conclusion: The work offers a safe, replicable, lookahead-bias-free generative AI framework that enables researchers to study prediction tasks without data leakage and quantify the minimal level of predictive performance that persists after removing lookahead bias.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

### [526] [Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization for Memory-efficient RL of Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683)
*Nianyi Lin,Jiajie Zhang,Lei Hou,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BGPO is a memory-efficient RL method for diffusion LLMs that uses a linear, per-sample lower bound on the ELBO objective, enabling gradient accumulation across many MC samples with constant memory and matching ELBO optimization in on-policy settings, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL with dLLMs suffers from intractable likelihoods whose ELBO-based approximations require retaining forward graphs of MC samples, causing heavy memory overhead and restricting sample sizes, which degrades objective accuracy.

Method: BGPO constructs a specially designed ELBO lower bound that is linear across MC samples and depends on a single sample per term. This enables gradient accumulation across samples and constant memory usage; the value and gradient of the bound equal those of the original ELBO objective in on-policy training, making it a faithful approximation.

Result: Empirical results show BGPO outperforms prior RL approaches for dLLMs on math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

Conclusion: By enabling large MC sample sizes with a memory-efficient bound that preserves ELBO value/gradient, BGPO yields more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, translating into better performance across tasks.

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

### [527] [Representation-Based Exploration for Language Models: From Test-Time to Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11686)
*Jens Tuyls,Dylan J. Foster,Akshay Krishnamurthy,Jordan T. Ash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deliberate exploration using a representation-based diversity bonus from pre-trained LM hidden states improves diversity, pass@k, and efficiency in RL for LMs, across post-training and inference-time settings, indicating exploration can enable discovery of new behaviors beyond mere sharpening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether explicit exploration drives novel behaviors in language-model RL, and how pre-trained knowledge can guide such exploration.

Method: Introduce a representation-based diversity bonus derived from the LM's hidden states to incentivize exploration; evaluate in post-training RL pipelines and inference-time scaling; measure pass@k and verifier efficiency across models and tasks (e.g., AIME 2024)

Result: Significant gains in diversity and pass@k; >50% improvement in verifier efficiency for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct; post-training yields improved reasoning performance and, for Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct on AIME 2024, match of GRPO's pass@256 (pass@80); overall 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Deliberate exploration with a principled diversity notion, anchored in pre-trained model representations, is a practical path to discovering new behaviors beyond simple sharpening of existing capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

### [528] [Tight Regret Upper and Lower Bounds for Optimistic Hedge in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11691)
*Taira Tsuchiya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work tightens regret bounds for optimistic Hedge in two-player zero-sum games; in the strongly-uncoupled setting with known opponent actions, social and individual regrets scale as O(sqrt(log m * log n)), with matching lower bounds; further, last-iterate convergence and dynamic regret are improved with tight constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the true dependence on the action counts m, n for regret of optimistic Hedge, close the upper-lower bound gap, and extend the tight analysis to dynamic regret and convergence properties.

Method: Refined regret analysis by reformulating the bound as an optimization problem over learning rates and negative-term coefficients; derive improved upper bounds; construct algorithm-dependent lower bounds; analyze last-iterate convergence and dynamic regret; provide matching alpha-beta constants.

Result: Upper bounds improved to O(sqrt(log m log n)) for both social and individual regret; lower bounds show these bounds are tight, including constants; improvements also extend to last-iterate convergence rate and dynamic regret with matching lower bounds.

Conclusion: In the strongly-uncoupled setting with known opponent action set, the dependence of regret on m and n for optimistic Hedge is optimal; dynamic and convergence properties also achieve tight bounds, clarifying the theoretical performance of optimistic Hedge.

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

### [529] [QeRL: Beyond Efficiency -- Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11696)
*Wei Huang,Yi Ge,Shuai Yang,Yicheng Xiao,Huizi Mao,Yujun Lin,Hanrong Ye,Sifei Liu,Ka Chun Cheung,Hongxu Yin,Yao Lu,Xiaojuan Qi,Song Han,Yukang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QeRL is a quantization-enhanced RL framework for LLMs that combines NVFP4 quantization with LoRA and Adaptive Quantization Noise to speed up rollout, reduce memory usage, and improve exploration, enabling efficient RL training on very large models (up to 32B) on a single GPU while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for LLMs is highly resource-intensive in memory and compute; quantization noise can boost exploration and efficiency. There is a need to scale RL training to very large models with limited hardware.

Method: Integrates NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and introduces Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) that dynamically adjusts quantization noise during training. Evaluates on LLMs up to 32B, comparing against 16-bit LoRA, QLoRA, and full-parameter fine-tuning on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH 500.

Result: Achieves over 1.5x rollout speedup. Enables RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU. Outperforms 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA in reward growth and final accuracy, and matches full-parameter fine-tuning on GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) for a 7B model.

Conclusion: QeRL is an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs, delivering both substantial speedups and strong performance.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

### [530] [Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11709)
*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial vulnerability stems from efficient information encoding via feature superposition, not from learning flaws or non-robust inputs; interference between superposed features makes attack patterns predictable. Demonstrated in synthetic settings and a ViT on CIFAR-10, it explains transferability and class-specific vulnerabilities as a byproduct of representational compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is debate whether adversarial examples arise from decision boundary irregularities or reliance on non-robust inputs. This work proposes a third view: vulnerability emerges from how networks compress information through superposition, enabling perturbations to exploit interference between features.

Method: (1) Theoretically analyze superposition as representing more features than dimensions, (2) show that perturbations exploit interference between superposed features, (3) provide synthetic experiments where superposition is controlled to demonstrate sufficiency for vulnerability, (4) validate findings on a Vision Transformer trained on CIFAR-10.

Result: Superposition is shown to be sufficient to create adversarial vulnerability in controlled synthetic settings. The framework accounts for transferability across models with similar training and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In a ViT trained on CIFAR-10, vulnerability persists, suggesting it is a byproduct of representational compression rather than learning flaws or non-robust inputs.

Conclusion: Adversarial vulnerability can be explained as a consequence of efficient information encoding via feature superposition, a byproduct of representational compression. This reframes vulnerability as arising from how networks encode information, and provides mechanistic insights into transferability and class-specific susceptibilities.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

### [531] [Reinforced sequential Monte Carlo for amortised sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11711)
*Sanghyeok Choi,Sarthak Mittal,Víctor Elvira,Jinkyoo Park,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework that fuses amortised neural samplers with particle-based SMC for sampling from unnormalised densities, via MaxEnt RL, off-policy training, adaptive tempering, and replay-based integration, yielding improved accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from unnormalised densities is hard; existing amortised or MC methods struggle with multimodality and exploration. By linking sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) with neural sequential samplers trained with maximum-entropy RL, the paper aims to leverage the strengths of both: expressive neural proposals and principled particle-based diversity.

Method: Propose a unified framework where learned sampling policies define proposal kernels and twist functions. Use an off-policy RL training procedure that treats SMC samples as a behavior policy to better explore the target. Develop techniques for stable joint training of proposals and twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce variance. Extend experience replay to combine historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights in a replay buffer.

Result: Empirical demonstrations on synthetic multi-modal targets (continuous and discrete) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide show improved approximation of the true distribution and enhanced training stability relative to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes a practical synergy between amortised neural samplers and particle-based methods, providing training strategies (off-policy RL, adaptive tempering, replay-buffer integration) that improve sampling quality and stability for unnormalised densities, with broad applicability to complex multimodal distributions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Xunjian Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A geometric flow framework for LLM reasoning: reasoning is modeled as smooth trajectories in representation space, disentangling logic from semantics, with logic acting as local controllers of flow velocity; validated via controlled experiments and representation proxies; provides interpretability tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs internalize reasoning beyond surface form and to provide a formal, geometric account of their reasoning processes for improved interpretability.

Method: Model reasoning as flows in representation space; distinguish logic from semantics by using same deduction propositions with different semantic carriers; analyze geometric quantities (position, velocity, curvature); use learned representation proxies; perform controlled experiments to visualize and quantify flows.

Result: LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth representation-space flows; logical statements locally control flow velocity; empirical visualization/quantification supports the theory.

Conclusion: Offers a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomena in LLMs, providing a new interpretability lens and enabling formal analysis of model behavior.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

*Valerie Chen,Rohit Malhotra,Xingyao Wang,Juan Michelini,Xuhui Zhou,Aditya Bharat Soni,Hoang H. Tran,Calvin Smith,Ameet Talwalkar,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces PULSE, a human-centric evaluation framework for LLM-powered agents that combines user feedback with model-generated pseudo-labels; deployed on OpenHands with 15k users to study how design choices affect developer satisfaction, achieving tighter confidence intervals and revealing gaps between in-the-wild usage and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking LLM agents often assumes full automation and overlooks human-in-the-loop realities. There is a need for efficient, robust evaluation methods that account for user satisfaction and collaborative usage.

Method: Propose PULSE: collect user feedback, train an ML model to predict user satisfaction, and compute results by combining human satisfaction with model-generated pseudo-labels. Apply on a live web platform (OpenHands) with 15k+ users, perform case studies on LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory; compare with standard A/B tests.

Result: PULSE reduces confidence intervals by ~40% versus standard A/B testing; uncovers substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmarks (e.g., anti-correlation between claude-sonnet-4 and gpt-5). Provides actionable insights into agent design and highlights limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation.

Conclusion: A human-centric, hybrid evaluation framework can produce more robust conclusions about agent designs in real-world settings and guide better design choices; benchmarks alone may mislead due to misalignment with human factors.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

TL;DR: A skeptical, wide-ranging overview of AI consciousness arguing that there is no settled view on whether AI can be conscious and that major theories conflict, with inconclusive standard arguments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI systems can be conscious by analyzing dominant theories of consciousness and their applicability to AI, and to highlight epistemic limits in diagnosing machine consciousness.

Method: Literature survey and critical critique of major theories (e.g., functionalism, materialism, Turing-style tests, global workspace, higher-order theories, IIT, recursive learning, substrate considerations) framed by a chapter-by-chapter examination.

Result: The book contends that none of the standard arguments decisively settles AI consciousness; theories disagree about what constitutes consciousness; future AI may or may not be conscious depending on the theory, and current arguments offer limited guidance.

Conclusion: We cannot determine which theories are correct or whether AI systems are truly conscious; the landscape is foggy, and progress requires clarifying criteria, accepting epistemic uncertainty, and possibly reevaluating substrate importance.

Abstract: This is a skeptical overview of the literature on AI consciousness. We will
soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential,
mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other
influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position
to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems
as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems
as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for
or against AI consciousness takes us far.

*Junyuan Liu,Quan Qin,Guangsheng Dong,Xinglei Wang,Jiazhuang Feng,Zichao Zeng,Tao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POI-guided alignment enriches AlphaEarth with urban semantics, improving land-use classification and socioeconomic mapping in London.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EO-based representations capture physical patterns but miss functional/socioeconomic urban aspects. There is a need for human-centered, transferable urban representations that integrate semantics with remote sensing features.

Method: AETHER adapts AlphaEarth via lightweight multimodal alignment between AE embeddings and textual representations of Points of Interest (POIs), injecting urban function and socioeconomic semantics without heavy retraining.

Result: In Greater London, AETHER achieves a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in KL divergence for socioeconomic mapping compared with the AE baseline.

Conclusion: Coupling EO with POI semantics yields general-purpose urban representations that blend physical form and functional meaning, while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications.

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Conclusion: LLM-based autonomous scientific agents have transformative potential to accelerate discovery across domains, but realizing this potential requires addressing core challenges in robustness, generalization, adaptability, interpretability, safety, and cross-domain integration throughout hypothesis generation, experimentation, and analysis.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to

Motivation: As AI systems gain long-term memory and personalize interactions, it is critical to understand how stored user information shapes emotional reasoning and whether this reinforces social biases.

Method: Evaluate 15 LLMs on human-validated emotional intelligence tests. Test identical scenarios with different user profiles. Analyze biases across profiles and demographics for emotion understanding and supportive recommendations.

Result: Memory-conditioned prompts produce systematic biases: advantaged user profiles yield more accurate emotional interpretations; significant demographic disparities exist in emotion understanding and recommendations; personalization can embed social hierarchies into AI emotional reasoning.

Conclusion: Personalization via memory poses a risk of reinforcing social inequalities in AI emotional reasoning; safeguards and fairness-aware memory mechanisms are needed to prevent embedding biases.

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

*Olivia Peiyu Wang,Tashvi Bansal,Ryan Bai,Emily M. Chui,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A low-cost, instruction-based, stepwise approach with binary questions and a final knowledge-graph verification improves LLM performance on logical fallacy classification and enhances transparency, offering a neuro-symbolic path to mitigate reasoning gaps without full System 2 training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit critical reasoning gaps, including hallucinations and poor performance in classifying logical fallacies, largely due to reliance on fast but flawed System 1 processing. Full System 2 training is expensive, creating a need for cheaper, effective interventions to improve reasoning. The work aims to bridge this gap with a cost-efficient, instruction-based method.

Method: The approach introduces a stepwise instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a sequence of atomic procedural steps implemented as simple binary questions. It adds a final verification step in which the model consults a relational knowledge graph of related fallacies to support decisions, forming a rule-based, neuro-symbolic intervention.

Result: The proposed procedural, rule-based intervention yields a significant improvement in LLMs' accuracy on logical fallacy classification and provides enhanced transparency into the models' decision-making processes.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, low-cost pathway toward mitigating LLM reasoning deficits, supporting a neuro-symbolic architecture that can achieve more reliable fallacy classification without expensive System 2 training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

### [539] [Deliberative Dynamics and Value Alignment in LLM Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10002)
*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Debate among LLMs to study multi-turn moral reasoning and value alignment in 1,000 Reddit 'Am I the Asshole' dilemmas; compares synchronous (parallel) vs round-robin formats; reveals model-specific differences in revision inertia, value emphasis, and susceptibility to order effects; highlights that dialogue structure shapes sociotechnical alignment as much as outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how values and moral reasoning emerge in extended dialogue among language models, and how deliberation formats influence alignment in sensitive, everyday moral decision tasks.

Method: Prompt subsets of three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively assign blame for 1,000 Reddit 'Am I the Asshole' dilemmas. Compare synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin (sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Measure revision rates, value emphasis, and final verdicts to assess deliberative dynamics and cross-model alignment.

Result: Synchronous responses reveal model-specific dynamics: GPT shows strong verdict inertia with low revision rates (0.6-3.1%), while Claude and Gemini demonstrate higher flexibility (28-41% revisions). Value patterns diverge across models—GPT favors personal autonomy and direct communication; Claude and Gemini emphasize empathetic dialogue. Certain values more effectively drive verdict changes. Deliberation format exerts strong influence: GPT and Gemini are more conforming overall, with verdicts heavily shaped by order effects; Claude less constrained. These findings indicate that the dialogic structure and model-specific tendencies substantially shape moral reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical alignment depends on dialogue design as much as on outputs.

Conclusion: Value alignment in LLMs in multi-turn, sensitive domains hinges on both the chosen deliberation format and model-specific behaviors. Relying on single-turn prompts may misrepresent alignment; evaluating and deploying LLMs for moral guidance requires attention to how dialogue structure, turn order, and revision dynamics shape final judgments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

*Meng Xi,Sihan Lv,Yechen Jin,Guanjie Cheng,Naibo Wang,Ying Li,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A black-box poisoning attack against complex RAG systems using reinforcement learning to generate poisoned documents, improving attack success and exposing defense gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study poisoning in realistic, multi-component RAG pipelines when the attacker has limited knowledge of internal system details, addressing limitations of prior white-box, simplified attacks.

Method: RIPRAG is an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats the target RAG system as a black box. It uses reinforcement learning to optimize the generation of poisoned documents, using only a success/failure signal as feedback across diverse RAG architectures.

Result: The approach achieves up to a 0.72 improvement in attack success rate over baseline methods and is effective against most complex RAG systems, revealing weaknesses in current defenses.

Conclusion: Black-box, multi-component RAG setups present significant security challenges; defenses must consider RL-driven poisoning in realistic attack scenarios, guiding future LLM security research.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Qinglin Zeng,Ningyuan Liu,Stephen Fan,Ziliang Chen,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reconceptualizes LLM workflow optimization as minimizing Expected Failure Mass in a high-dimensional Failure Signature Space using CE-Graph, a failure-driven graph-edit framework that targets dense failure modes from counterexamples, achieving higher robustness at lower cost than baselines on math/code/QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalar success/failure signals collapse rich failure structure, hindering understanding of failure distributions; a distributional view is needed to guide robust improvements.

Method: Introduce CE-Graph; approximate failure distribution from counterexamples; identify densest regions (recurring failure modes); Propose-and-Verify constrained graph edits to reduce observed failure mass; perform gradient-like descent on the failure landscape.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines in math, code, QA benchmarks; higher robustness at significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: Reliability emerges from learning and reshaping the geometry of failure distributions; a distributional lens enables principled improvements over scalar optimization.

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

### [542] [Belief Graphs with Reasoning Zones: Structure, Dynamics, and Epistemic Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10042)
*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based framework that separates external credibility from internal confidence, uses contractive belief propagation over signed, directed graphs, defines high-confidence reasoning zones, and uses local repairs and shock updates to enable contradiction-tolerant, locality-preserving inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Belief systems are often globally inconsistent; the key challenge is to reason safely in regions of the network where structure supports classical inference, while down-weighting or isolating contradictions elsewhere. The framework aims to disentangle source trust from internal network-derived confidence and to provide scalable, localizable reasoning mechanisms.

Method: Beliefs are nodes in a directed, signed, weighted graph with edges for support/contradiction. Confidence is obtained via a contractive propagation that blends a stated prior with structure-aware influence to yield a unique, stable solution. Reasoning zones are high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs. Seeding zones uses confidence, balance is tested with a parity-based coloring, and a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard dedup builds a compact atlas. Shock updates locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions, with backtracking to maintain contractivity; re-propagation yields reconfiguration zones without destabilizing the entire graph. Evaluation protocol on synthetic planted-sign graphs reports zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.

Result: A near-linear procedure for identifying and repairing reasoning zones, with a validated protocol on synthetic data showing zone recovery, stability to shocks, and favorable runtime characteristics.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning, activating classical logic precisely where the structure supports it, and scales to large graphs through local, contractive dynamics.

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

*Ruohao Li,Hongjun Liu,Leyi Zhao,Zisu Li,Jiawei Li,Jiajun Jiang,Linning Xu,Chen Zhao,Mingming Fan,Chen Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwarmSys introduces a swarm-inspired, closed-loop multi-agent framework that coordinates Explorers, Workers, and Validators to enable scalable, adaptive long-horizon reasoning without centralized control. It uses adaptive profiles, embedding-based matching, and pheromone-like reinforcement to dynamically allocate tasks and self-organize, achieving improved accuracy and reasoning stability across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, suggesting coordination scaling can rival model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems rely on fixed roles or centralized control, which hampers scalability and adaptability in long-horizon reasoning. There is a need for scalable, robust coordination mechanisms that can adapt to dynamic tasks without global supervision.

Method: SwarmSys implements three specialized roles—Explorers, Workers, and Validators—that iteratively cycle through exploration, exploitation, and validation in a closed loop. It introduces adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based probabilistic matching for task assignment, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism to guide dynamic task allocation and self-organization without global supervision. The framework is evaluated on symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks.

Result: SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines across the evaluated tasks, achieving higher accuracy and greater reasoning stability in symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming.

Conclusion: SwarmSys demonstrates that swarm-inspired coordination is a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and adaptive multi-agent reasoning. The approach suggests that coordination scaling could rival model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

*Zeyu Ling,Xiaodong Gu,Jiangnan Tang,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE is a self-supervised pretraining method for talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics via masked visual modeling and cross-modal contrastive alignment, using per-frame tokens for identity, vocal motion, and ambient motion; achieves state-of-the-art across four task families including synchronization, emotion/action recognition, visual speech recognition, and visual dubbing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for a unified pretraining framework that explicitly encodes synchronization and factorized components of facial dynamics to enable transfer across multiple audio-visual tasks.

Method: Couples masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive learning; uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives; introduces per-frame tokens for identity, vocal motion, ambient motion; aligns audio and visual streams into a shared embedding space.

Result: Four task families show state-of-the-art results; improved synchronization and performance across audio-visual synchronization, emotion/action recognition, visual speech recognition, and visual dubbing; demonstrates effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized pretraining.

Conclusion: A unified, synchronization-aware self-supervised pretraining framework enabling versatile downstream tasks with shared representation and token-level alignment, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepFly is a three-stage agentic framework that automates troubleshooting guides for incident management by extracting structured DAGs, providing quality tooling, and DAG-guided execution, yielding high success rates and significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual TSG execution is slow and error-prone; existing LLMs lack support for TSG quality control, complex control flow, data-heavy queries, and parallelism. An empirical study motivates a dedicated framework.

Method: Three-stage workflow: Stage 1 TSG Mentor to improve quality; Stage 2 offline preprocessing to extract execution DAGs and create QPPs; Stage 3 online DAG-guided scheduler-executor with memory enabling parallelism.

Result: On real TSGs/incidents, achieves ~94% success with GPT-4.1; outperforms baselines and reduces execution time by 32.9%-70.4% on parallelizable TSGs.

Conclusion: StepFly delivers effective end-to-end automation for incident management, addressing key challenges and enabling fast, reliable, parallel troubleshooting.

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

*Yunxiang Mo,Tianshi Zheng,Qing Zong,Jiayu Liu,Baixuan Xu,Yauwai Yim,Chunkit Chan,Jiaxin Bai,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DixitWorld offers a two-part evaluation for multimodal abductive reasoning: DixitArena for dynamic, multi-agent generation and selection (storyteller vs listener) and DixitBench for a static listener-focused benchmark; results show a role-dependent split where small open-source models invent creative but less discriminative clues, while large proprietary models excel as listeners; DixitBench correlates with listener performance in DixitArena, highlighting a creativity-discrimination trade-off and the need for balanced vision-language agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language model evaluations are dominated by static, single-agent tasks. The paper introduces DixitWorld to decompose abductive reasoning into generation and selection under imperfect information, inspired by the Dixit game to enable a comprehensive and controllable evaluation suite.

Method: Introduce two components: DixitArena (dynamic, multi-agent environment where a 'storyteller' generates cryptic clues and 'listeners' pick the target image among decoys under imperfect information) and DixitBench (static QA benchmark isolating the listener task). Evaluate a range of models (varying sizes, including smaller open-source and larger proprietary models) on both components to measure generative creativity and discriminative accuracy; examine cross-component correlations.

Result: Found distinct role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models tend to be more imaginative storytellers but provide less discriminative clues; larger proprietary models achieve superior overall performance, particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench correlates strongly with listener results in DixitArena, validating DixitBench as a proxy for hypothesis selection.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning. DixitWorld provides a balanced, scalable framework to drive the development of vision-language agents that simultaneously excel at generating plausible explanations and accurately selecting correct hypotheses.

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

*Zhongsheng Wang,Ming Lin,Zhedong Lin,Yaser Shakib,Qian Liu,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CharCom is a modular, prompt-aware, parameter-efficient framework that preserves character identity across varying prompts in diffusion-based text-to-image generation by composing per-character LoRA adapters on a frozen backbone, enabling scalable, consistent multi-character story illustration without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based T2I struggles with character identity consistency across prompts; existing methods require fine-tuning or lack scalability. There is a need for per-character customization with low overhead to support story-like multi-scene narratives.

Method: Leverages a frozen diffusion backbone and composes modular LoRA adapters at inference time. Adapters are per-character, parameter-efficient, and dynamically assembled based on the current prompt to maintain identity and semantics while avoiding full-model fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on multi-scene narratives show improved character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. The method is robust in crowded scenes and supports scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, suitable for story illustration and animation.

Conclusion: CharCom offers a practical, scalable solution for character-consistent diffusion generation by modularizing identity through adapters, enabling real-world applications without retraining the base model.

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

*Chengqian Gao,Haonan Li,Taylor W. Killian,Jianshu She,Renxi Wang,Liqun Ma,Zhoujun Cheng,Shibo Hao,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PALU is a principled, performance-aware method for concise reasoning in LLMs that minimizes output length under a performance constraint using Lagrangian optimization and practical approximations; it significantly reduces length and improves accuracy across domains and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concise reasoning methods rely on hand-crafted heuristics, struggle to trade off concision vs. performance, and fail to adapt across domains and model sizes; there is a need for a pragmatic, scalable approach.

Method: Formulate as constrained optimization to minimize response length with a performance constraint; convert to unconstrained via Lagrangian optimization; practical approximations: (i) off-policy rollouts estimate performance; (ii) truncate the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes; (iii) replace gradient updates with quantile-driven length adjustments.

Result: PALU reduces output length by 65% and increases accuracy by 15% on DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks; it outperforms a range of alternative methods.

Conclusion: PALU generalizes across domains (logic, STEM, math) and model scales (1.5B, 7B, 14B), offering a practical, effective approach to concise reasoning.

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

*Qingni Wang,Yue Fan,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAFER offers abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering to provide risk-controlled prediction sets for open-ended QA with LLMs, calibrating a sampling budget via Clopper-Pearson and applying conformal risk control to filter distractors, with an abstention option if risk constraints cannot be met.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) assumes finite sampling of admissible answers, which is unrealistic for open-ended QA with no fixed solution space. There is a need for statistically valid risk guarantees that accommodate abstention and open-ended outputs.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) abstention-aware sampling: calibrate a sampling budget on a held-out calibration set using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-specified miscoverage level; abstain if the risk cannot be met within a cap; (2) conformalized filtering: using calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget, apply conformal risk control to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold to filter unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test instance; introduce an additional risk level to guide threshold calculation and control the risk of excluding correct answers. SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration/test split ratios.

Result: SAFER provides a practical, data-efficient, and statistically grounded risk-control mechanism for open-ended QA, enabling abstention when necessary and filtering of candidate answers with calibrated uncertainty thresholds while maintaining miscoverage guarantees where possible.

Conclusion: SAFER extends SCP to open-ended QA by incorporating abstention and calibrated risk-aware filtering, offering robust, data-efficient risk guarantees and broad compatibility with different task settings.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

*Siyuan Lu,Zechuan Wang,Hongxuan Zhang,Qintong Wu,Leilei Gan,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu,Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Environment Tuning enables data-efficient, exploration-driven training of LLM agents from problem instances, achieving competitive in-distribution performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity and instability of SFT/RL in training LLM agents for complex, multi-turn tool-use tasks.

Method: Introduce Environment Tuning: a curriculum-driven, environment-augmented learning paradigm that provides corrective feedback and fine-grained progress rewards, enabling learning directly from problem instances without pre-collected expert trajectories; demonstrated on 400 BFCL instances.

Result: Competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines and superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming SFT-based collapse and RL cold-start issues.

Conclusion: Shifts training from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, enabling more robust and data-efficient LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

*Manjiang Yu,Hongji Li,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PIXEL is a principled, tuning-free position-wise activation steering method for LLMs that learns a property-aligned subspace from dual views, uses a closed-form constrained objective to set injection strength, and applies residual calibration and position scanning to robustly align attributes while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable, principled alignment of LLMs without coarse heuristics or heavy hyperparameter tuning, addressing where to steer and how much to intervene for truthful, trustworthy generation.

Method: Learn a property-aligned subspace from tail-averaged and end-token views; select intervention strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution; perform sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to refine the global attribute direction; use a lightweight position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites; provide representation-level guarantees for minimal-intervention behavior.

Result: PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment across diverse models and evaluation paradigms while preserving model general capabilities; code is released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: PIXEL offers a practical, principled framework for controllable generation in LLMs with token-level adaptivity and minimal manual tuning, addressing limitations of prior heuristic steering methods.

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

*Yujian Zhang,Keyu Chen,Zhifeng Shen,Ruizhi Qiao,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Dual Reasoner (ADR) balances fast and slow reasoning with entropy-guided RL, achieving better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and shorter outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Reasoning Models achieve high performance but incur high computation costs and latency due to overthinking. The paper motivates a dynamic, context-aware approach to switch between fast and slow reasoning to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: ADR uses two reasoning modes (fast and slow) and dynamically selects between them based on contextual complexity. Training occurs in two stages: (1) cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a hybrid reasoning dataset to enable integration of both modes; (2) reinforcement learning with Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (EHPO), featuring an entropy-guided rollout for high-entropy units and a difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning.

Result: ADR achieves state-of-the-art-like performance-efficiency balance on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with up to 6.1% performance gain and a reduction in reasoning output length of 49.5% to 59.3%.

Conclusion: ADR provides an effective balance between reasoning performance and efficiency, outperforming existing approaches on difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

*Zixuan Qin,Kunlin Lyu,Qingchen Yu,Yifan Sun,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A perturbation-based method reveals ultra-sparse, highly influential neurons in LLMs, whose disruption can cause catastrophic model collapse and dramatic performance drops, concentrated in outer layers (MLP down-proj). This challenges assumptions about distributed representations and has implications for robustness and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs harbor a small subset of critical neurons akin to biological brains, and to understand their role in robustness and interpretability.

Method: Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons: systematically locate and disrupt individual neurons (or components) in LLMs and observe effects on performance (e.g., perplexity, collapse) across architectures and scales.

Result: Found ultra-sparse critical neuron sets; disrupting these can collapse a 72B-parameter model (~1.1B neurons total). Perplexity can surge up to 20 orders of magnitude. Critical neurons cluster in outer layers, especially in MLP down_proj components. Degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions rather than gradual decline.

Conclusion: These results enhance understanding of LLM robustness and interpretability, suggesting design considerations for more robust architectures and deployment security in safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

*Haolang Lu,Bolun Chu,WeiYe Fu,Guoshun Nan,Junning Liu,Minghui Pan,Qiankun Li,Yi Yu,Hua Wang,Kun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight two-step plugin identifies perception vs. reasoning attention heads in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) to curb hallucinations; it applies class-conditioned rescaling without retraining, improving reliability by ~5% (up to 15%) with minimal compute and latency, and is model-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in MLRMs remains a core challenge, manifesting as faulty reasoning and misinterpretation of visual content. Understanding that attention heads divide into perception (shallow) and symbolic reasoning (deep) motivates targeted interventions to improve reliability and interpretability for cross-modal reasoning systems.

Method: A two-step plugin: (1) Functional Head Identification to locate perception- and reasoning-oriented heads, and (2) Class-conditioned Rescaling to modulate their contributions. The approach is lightweight, interpretable, and does not require retraining, and is model-agnostic.

Result: Empirical evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision) across six benchmarks and four baselines show an average improvement of 5%, with up to 15% gains. Computing overhead is <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency. The plugin enhances reliability and interpretability of off-the-shelf MLRMs.

Conclusion: The proposed Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling plugin provides a practical, model-agnostic solution to reduce hallucinations in MLRMs, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes applications while preserving efficiency and without retraining. Code is available at the provided URL.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A practical LLM-based approach for Airbnb support using the ICA reformatted workflow and synthetic data to fine-tune models, achieving improved accuracy and faster processing at lower cost; demonstrated in internal experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the complexity of Airbnb policies/workflows and LLM data/finetuning costs by restructuring inputs (ICA) and using synthetic data to enable cost-effective fine-tuning, improving customer support performance.

Method: Introduce Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format to reform policies/workflows for LLM comprehension; generate synthetic training data with minimal human input; fine-tune LLMs on this data; evaluate in internal experiments (not on Airbnb products).

Result: The approach significantly enhances LLM performance on customer-support tasks, improving accuracy and reducing manual processing time in internal tests, at a lower cost due to synthetic data.

Conclusion: ICA reformatted workflows plus synthetic-data fine-tuning offer a cost-effective path to superior LLM-based customer support; results establish a new benchmark in internal experiments, with potential applicability beyond the tested scope, though not yet deployed in Airbnb products.

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The inclusive innovation dividend argues that designing healthcare AI for diverse, constrained use cases yields greater returns in broader markets, driven by four mechanisms. A Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF) scores investments for their inclusive potential, guiding resource allocation and enabling strategic differentiation beyond compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established, but the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored. The paper draws on assistive technologies that evolved into large mainstream markets to argue that inclusive design can expand market reach, reduce risk, improve performance, and aid talent and adoption, making it a strategic business driver.

Method: A perspective-based analysis that synthesizes evidence from assistive tech success stories; identifies four mechanisms by which inclusive design generates value; introduces HAIIF as a practical scoring system to evaluate AI investments for inclusive impact and guide resource allocation.

Result: The paper posits four mechanisms by which inclusive design drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic scalability and trust; (2) risk mitigation through lower remediation costs and litigation risk; (3) performance dividends from better generalization and reduced technical debt; (4) competitive advantages in talent and clinical adoption. It presents HAIIF to operationalize evaluation of investments for inclusive value. Incremental inclusive design yields expanded market reach and sustained competitive advantages; treating inclusivity as overhead leads to network/data disadvantages for late movers.

Conclusion: Inclusive design is a strategic differentiator for healthcare AI. By treating fairness and inclusivity as engines of value rather than regulatory checkboxes—and using HAII F to guide investments—organizations can capture broader markets and create durable competitive advantages. Early movers who embed inclusion gain network effects; others risk compounding disadvantages as data and adoption advantages accrue to leaders.

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

*Siddartha Devic,Charlotte Peale,Arwen Bradley,Sinead Williamson,Preetum Nakkiran,Aravind Gollakota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trace length during reasoning in large language models serves as a simple, effective confidence signal for uncertainty estimation, complementing verbal confidence and improving reliability after reasoning post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is crucial to reduce hallucinations and improve the reliable deployment of LLMs. Existing confidence signals are imperfect; the paper investigates a lightweight, model-inherent signal—trace length—as a practical estimator that could enhance QA and reasoning reliability.

Method: Extensive experiments across multiple models, datasets, prompts, and reasoning traces. The study compares trace length to other zero-shot confidence estimators (e.g., verbalized confidence), analyzes how reasoning post-training alters the trace-length–accuracy relationship, and controls for confounders like problem difficulty and length bias. It also examines the role of high-entropy or 'forking' tokens in the mechanism.

Result: Trace length performs comparably to, and in some cases complements, verbal confidence as a zero-shot confidence estimator. Reasoning post-training changes the connection between trace length and accuracy, amplifying its utility beyond prior “overthinking” observations. The effect persists after accounting for difficulty and length biases, with high-entropy tokens contributing significantly to the signal. Overall, trace length emerges as a practical, robust confidence measure for large reasoning models.

Conclusion: Reasoning trace length is a simple yet powerful tool for uncertainty quantification in large reasoning models and can augment existing confidence signals. The finding supports deploying trace-length-based checks to mitigate hallucination and improve reliability in LLM-driven tasks.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

*Sihang Zeng,Yujuan Fu,Sitong Zhou,Zixuan Yu,Lucas Jing Liu,Jun Wen,Matthew Thompson,Ruth Etzioni,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traj-CoA is a multi-agent chain-of-agents framework that processes long, noisy EHR data in chunks, distills key events into a shared memory (EHRMem), and uses a final manager to predict outcomes; it achieves strong zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk predictions from five-year EHR data, with clinically aligned temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic health records are long, noisy, and temporally complex. Standard LLMs struggle with long sequences and noise when modeling patient trajectories. There is a need for scalable, robust methods that can preserve a coherent timeline and extract salient temporal information for prediction.

Method: A chain-of-worker agents processes EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially. Each worker distills events and updates a shared long-term memory module (EHRMem). A final manager agent synthesizes worker summaries and the extracted timeline to make predictions. The approach is evaluated in a zero-shot setting on a one-year lung cancer risk prediction task using five-year EHR data.

Result: Traj-CoA outperforms baselines across four categories in the zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk task. The model demonstrates clinically aligned temporal reasoning, suggesting robustness and generalizability for modeling complex patient trajectories.

Conclusion: Traj-CoA presents a promising, generalizable approach for modeling patient trajectories by effectively handling long, noisy EHR data through chained agents and a shared memory, enabling improved temporal reasoning and prediction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems often tackle tasks in isolation, lacking cross-validation and knowledge integration typical of clinical teams, hindering real-world effectiveness in integrated workflows.

Method: Develop MedCoAct, a multi-agent framework with doctor and pharmacist agents and a confidence mechanism; create DrugCareQA benchmark to evaluate integrated diagnosis and treatment; compare against single-agent baselines.

Result: Achieves 67.58% diagnostic accuracy and 67.58% medication recommendation accuracy, outperforming single-agent frameworks by ~7 percentage points; demonstrates generalizability across medical domains; provides interpretable decision pathways.

Conclusion: Collaborative, confidence-aware multi-agent systems can transform isolated medical AI into integrated clinical workflows, with strong potential for telemedicine and routine care; interpretability is preserved.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

*Martina G. Vilas,Safoora Yousefi,Besmira Nushi,Eric Horvitz,Vidhisha Balachandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent-Trajectory signals are latent-space dynamics metrics that predict the success of reasoning traces and guide test-time scaling, reducing compute up to 70% while preserving or improving accuracy (avg +2.6%), with signals emerging early in the trace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify productive reasoning traces during inference-time scaling in order to reduce wasted computation and improve efficiency in problem-solving models.

Method: Define and extract Latent-Trajectory signals from a model's internal representations across the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens: (i) overall change from start to end, (ii) accumulated change across steps, and (iii) progression toward the final state; compare predictive power to cross-layer metrics and output confidence; use signals to guide answer selection across multiple samples.

Result: Latent-Trajectory signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than other metrics; when used to select among multiple generations, they enable more efficient inference (up to 70% token reduction) while maintaining or improving accuracy (avg +2.6%); signals often emerge early, enabling early compute allocation to promising candidates.

Conclusion: Offers practical inference-time strategies and contributes to interpretability by revealing how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELAIPBench is a domain-expert, adversarially annotated benchmark of AI papers with 403 MCQs from 137 papers; best LLM ~40% accuracy; advanced methods like thinking mode or RAG do not help and may hurt; reveals a substantial gap in true paper comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to capture deep comprehension and reasoning over full-length scientific papers; there is a need for robust, domain-expert created evaluation to measure genuine understanding rather than surface retrieval.

Method: Adversarial annotation by domain experts to construct 403 multiple-choice questions drawn from 137 AI papers, spanning three difficulty levels; emphasizes non-trivial reasoning over retrieval; uses incentive-driven process; evaluates LLM performance with and without thinking modes or RAG.

Result: Best-performing LLM achieves 39.95% accuracy; frontier LLMs with thinking mode or RAG do not improve results and can reduce accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic papers; existing benchmarks and methods are insufficient, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation frameworks for deep scientific understanding.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

### [562] [A Layered Intuition -- Method Model with Scope Extension for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10592)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension integrates intuition-driven first responses, modular method-based reasoning, and broad vertical/horizontal/temporal/spatial extensions organized as a knowledge network, evaluated by an entropy-based metric to improve LLM reasoning on unseen problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing method-based reasoning and scope extension by providing a systematic, scalable framework that generalizes reasoning across unseen, indirect issues and real-world contexts.

Method: Propose a layered model: (1) intuition-based thinking for rapid initial answers; (2) method-based thinking that decouples questions and solutions into transferable reasoning units; (3) scope extension expanding applicability through vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel/generalized issues), and novel temporal and spatial extensions; (4) organization of extensions into systematic knowledge trees that connect into a knowledge network; (5) introduction of entropy of method extension as a quantitative metric measuring independence and diversity of extensions.

Result: A theoretical framework and entropy-based evaluation approach that link existing approaches with new extensions, yielding a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs dealing with unseen, real-world problems.

Conclusion: The work advances LLM reasoning by integrating intuition, modular methods, and broad scope extensions within a connected knowledge network, using an entropy-based metric to assess and guide the capacity to solve unseen questions.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

### [563] [A Distance Measure for Random Permutation Set: From the Layer-2 Belief Structure Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10596)
*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Serafín Moral,José Ramón Trillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a cumulative Jaccard index-based distance for random permutation sets (RPS) and analyzes its metric properties, providing a correction scheme and tunable parameters; demonstrates improved sensitivity and compatibility with the Jousselme distance via numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring distances between permutation mass functions in RPST is essential for comparing order-structured uncertain information. Existing methods have limitations when capturing the influence of higher-ranked elements and when integrating with TBM/RFS frameworks. A robust, flexible distance that respects order and provides tunable behavior is needed.

Method: Define a cumulative Jaccard index for permutations, build a cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and derive a distance measure for RPSs from it. Analyze metric properties (including positive definiteness) and apply a correction scheme. Introduce two tunable parameters: weight and truncation depth, and validate via numerical examples against an existing method, examining compatibility with the Jousselme distance.

Result: The proposed distance measure exhibits metric properties after correction, features a natural top-weightiness (higher-ranked inconsistencies contribute more to distance), and aligns with the Jousselme distance while offering higher sensitivity and flexibility. The authors provide guidelines for choosing the two parameters and demonstrate improved performance through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The cumulative Jaccard-based distance overcomes shortcomings of prior approaches, is compatible with established distances like Jousselme, and offers enhanced sensitivity and adaptability for RPST analysis within RFS/TBM frameworks.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

*WenTao Liu,Siyu Song,Hao Hao,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces EA4LLM, an evolutionary-algorithm-based method to train LLMs; demonstrates training a 1B-parameter model from pre-trained weights, suggesting EAs can supplement or replace gradient-based methods and lower resource barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based optimizers demand high concurrency, memory, and differentiability, excluding non-differentiable architectures and limiting accessibility.

Method: Proposes EA4LLM, applying evolutionary algorithms to optimize LLMs; first-time demonstration of scaling to 1B parameters from pre-trained stage; includes extensive experiments to derive practical insights into EA-based training.

Result: EA4LLM successfully trains a 1B-parameter LLM from a pre-trained state; experiments yield insights into when and how evolutionary methods can effectively optimize neural networks.

Conclusion: Questions the notion that gradient-based optimization is the only viable approach for neural networks; potential to reduce training costs and democratize DL research by enabling resource-constrained groups to participate.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

### [565] [Collaborative Text-to-Image Generation via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Semantic Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10633)
*Jiabao Shi,Minfeng Qi,Lefeng Zhang,Di Wang,Yingjie Zhao,Ziying Li,Yalong Xing,Ningran Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent PPO-based framework coordinates domain-specialized agents across two text-image subsystems to enhance semantic alignment and detail in multimodal generation. It achieves substantial content enrichment and competitive composite scores, but still faces cross-modal grounding challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains in multimodal generation by using specialization-driven collaboration and robust cross-modal training.

Method: Train domain-specialized agents (architecture, portraiture, landscape) within two coupled subsystems (text enhancement and image generation) augmented with multimodal integration components. Use Proximal Policy Optimization with a composite reward balancing semantic similarity, linguistic-visual quality, and content diversity. Enforce cross-modal alignment via contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative text-image feedback. Evaluate across six settings, comparing fusion methods (Transformer-based) and multimodal ensembles.

Result: Content richness dramatically increases (word count up by 1614%), but ROUGE-1 scores decrease by 69.7%. Transformer-based fusion achieves the highest composite score (0.521). Multimodal ensembles show moderate consistency (0.444–0.481). These results highlight both the potential of specialization-driven, collaborative architectures and the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding.

Conclusion: Collaborative, specialization-driven architectures hold promise for reliable multimodal generation, demonstrating notable content enhancement and competitive integration scores, while underscoring ongoing challenges in achieving robust cross-modal grounding and stability across fusion methods.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interpretable boosting-based model (APLR) best predicts learning satisfaction, revealing key factors and enabling personalized education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap in applying modern interpretable ML to student satisfaction and provide actionable, individualized insights for instruction.

Method: Apply Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression (APLR), a boosting/interpretable model, to predict learning satisfaction and compare against state-of-the-art methods; analyze both numerical and visual interpretations to identify impactful factors and enable individual-level profiling.

Result: APLR offers the best fit among evaluated methods. Key positive predictors: students' time management, concentration, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation in offline courses. Creative activities show no positive effect. Interpretations support personalized instruction at the individual level.

Conclusion: Interpretable models like APLR can deliver both accurate predictions and actionable, individualized guidance for educators, enabling tailored instructional approaches based on student profiles.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Motivation: Address aging populations, shifting district demographics, and infrastructure constraints to reduce unmet hospital need and promote equitable access; combine GeoAI, forecasting, and equity measurement.

Method: Develop an Equity Index from district-level demographics, aging population density, and infrastructure balances; use an interpretable Agentic AI optimizer to allocate beds and locate new facilities under budget and travel-time constraints; integrate long-term forecasting with equity-focused optimization.

and equitable hospital planning in Germany through 2030. We combine
district-level demographic shifts, aging population density, and infrastructure
balances into a unified Equity Index. An interpretable Agentic AI optimizer
then allocates beds and identifies new facility sites to minimize unmet need

### [568] [Hierarchical Optimization via LLM-Guided Objective Evolution for Mobility-on-Demand Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10644)
*Yi Zhang,Yushen Long,Yun Ni,Liping Huang,Xiaohong Wang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free hybrid LLM-optimization framework for ride-hailing that uses an LLM to generate high-level objectives for a low-level optimizer, refined via harmony search; achieves 16% average improvement over baselines on NY and Chicago datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning approaches suffer from data inefficiency and oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, while decomposed online optimization relies on manually designed high-level objectives that ignore low-level routing dynamics. A framework that combines learning-like guidance with real-time optimization—without training data—could better handle dynamic, spatially heterogeneous supply and demand.

Method: A dynamic hierarchical system where the LLM acts as a meta-optimizer to produce semantic heuristics that guide a low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time decisions. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop evolutionary process driven by harmony search, which adaptively updates LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization layer. The approach is training-free.

Result: Experiments on scenarios derived from New York and Chicago taxi datasets show an average improvement of 16% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid LLM-optimization framework effectively bridges cognitive gaps in problem decomposition, avoids RL data requirements, and demonstrates notable performance gains. It highlights a promising direction for combining LLMs with mathematical optimization in dynamic, real-world systems; further work could address scalability, robustness, and deployment challenges.

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Can Xie,Ruotong Pan,Xiangyu Wu,Yunfei Zhang,Jiayi Fu,Tingting Gao,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCAS refines credit assignment in RLVR by incorporating model uncertainty at both the response and token levels, improving exploration, diversity, and performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while mitigating entropy collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing RLVR methods apply a uniform token-ensemble advantage signal (e.g., GRPO), ignoring when high-stakes uncertain decisions occur, leading to inefficient exploration and entropy collapse.

Method: Two-stage, model-free approach: (1) adjust the response-level advantage by the model's overall self-confidence; (2) impose a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty, guiding exploration toward uncertain but potentially correct reasoning paths and punishing overconfident errors.

Result: On five mathematical reasoning benchmarks across 1.5B and 7B scale models, UCAS outperforms RLVR baselines, yielding higher rewards, greater reasoning diversity, and reduced entropy collapse.

Conclusion: UCAS effectively balances exploration and exploitation in RLVR for LLM reasoning, improving performance and diversity while mitigating entropy collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Conclusion: simpliflow provides a concise, extensible platform for deterministic agentic workflows, offering simplicity and speed relative to more heavyweight frameworks, and fostering rapid prototyping via open-source tooling.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniVideoBench: a large-scale benchmark for synergistic audio-visual reasoning in video understanding, featuring 1000 QA pairs with step-by-step traces from 628 videos, spanning 13 question types; designed to force modality complementarity and logical consistency; reveals a performance gap between open-source and closed-source MLLMs; will be released to spur advances in audio-visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks inadequately assess the joint reasoning capabilities across audio and visual streams, often omitting one modality or combining them in inconsistent ways. There is a need for a dataset that emphasizes modality complementarity and logical consistency to drive genuine multimodal reasoning.

Method: Design and curate OmniVideoBench: 1000 high-quality QA pairs with annotated reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos (seconds to 30 minutes); ensure careful construction, correctness, uniqueness, and 13 targeted question types (temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, etc.). All items are manually verified.

Result: Evaluations of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveal a marked gap between current model performance and human reasoning; open-source models underperform compared with closed-source models, underscoring the difficulty of true audio-visual reasoning.

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench will be released to promote development of stronger, more generalizable audio-visual reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

*Yang Xu,Shuwei Chen,Jun Liu,Feng Cao,Xingxing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Extended Triangular Method (ETM) as the algorithmic core of the Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, unifying multiple contradiction-building strategies within a triangular geometry to enable dynamic, multi-clause reasoning; achieves competitive results on standard first-order benchmarks and bridges theory with practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency in automated deduction by overcoming the pairwise-clause limitation of binary resolution. The CSE framework enables dynamic, multi-clause contradiction-building; ETM formalizes and extends this paradigm to be practical and scalable, addressing a gap where prior work established theory but lacked algorithmic realization.

Method: Formalize and generalize CSE into the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a contradiction-construction algorithm. ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies (including the Standard Extension) within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. Implemented as the core algorithm in high-performance provers (CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, CSI-Enig) and evaluated on standard benchmarks (TPTP, CASC 2018-2015).

Result: ETM provides a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive contradiction-separation approach; empirical results on standard benchmarks validate its effectiveness and generality, showing competitive performance and demonstrating the feasibility of the contradiction-separation paradigm in real systems.

Conclusion: ETM advances the contradiction-separation paradigm by providing a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, bridging theory and implementation and suggesting new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

### [573] [Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703)
*Xiangyu Wang,Haocheng Yang,Fengxiang Cheng,Fenrong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive selection of target logical form (first-order logic, logic programming, or SAT) per problem significantly boosts LLM reasoning by choosing the most suitable SL before translation and solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that translation accuracy alone does not guarantee good NL-to-SL reasoning; different NL reasoning tasks align with different SL formalisms, so selecting the optimal SL type for each problem can improve overall performance.

Method: Use LLMs to pick the best target SL among FOL, logic programming, and SAT for a given NL problem, translate NL to that SL, and solve with the corresponding solver to obtain the final answer.

Result: Adaptive SL selection substantially outperforms translating all problems into a single SL and random SL selection; on a mixed benchmark dataset it achieves 96% accuracy, about 25% higher than the best single-SL (FOL) translation.

Conclusion: Adaptive SL selection is effective for NL-based reasoning with LLMs, reducing the dependence on a single formalism and improving overall accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to assess whether LLMs exhibit belief-coherent strategic reasoning in static games, showing they can form beliefs, evaluate actions, and choose best responses, with depth-limiting and emergent meta-reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models can engage in genuine strategic thinking—coherent beliefs about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and decision-making based on those beliefs—beyond surface-level equilibrium adherence or shallow reasoning. The study also seeks to separate belief formation, evaluation, and choice, and rules out memorization through a context-free game.

Method: Disentangle beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games and analyze both models’ revealed choices and reasoning traces. Apply across a suite of non-cooperative environments. Introduce a context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization. Examine targeted reasoning depths, emergent meta-reasoning, and when explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristics.

Result: Frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents, revealing emergent meta-reasoning. Under higher complexity, explicit recursion yields to stable, model-specific heuristic rules of choice, distinct from known human biases.

Conclusion: Belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge from LLM objectives. The framework provides a structured basis for studying strategic cognition in artificial agents and has implications for domains like negotiation and market design, while highlighting the potential for model-specific heuristics to influence strategic behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

### [575] [DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815)
*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT decomposes informal statements into sub-components to enable targeted premise retrieval and illustrative theorem selection, boosting autoformalization performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating formalization with LLMs is constrained by limited context and prerequisite knowledge; current retrieval methods miss deeper math concepts, hindering formalization.

Method: DRIFT splits informal statements into smaller sub-components, performs targeted retrieval of premises and illustrative theorems from Mathlib, and evaluates on ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test.

Result: Premise retrieval improves; F1 on ProofNet nearly doubles versus DPR; strong ConNF performance with BEq+@10 gains of 37.14% (GPT-4.1) and 42.25% (DeepSeek-V3.1); retrieval effectiveness is model-dependent.

Conclusion: Adaptive, model-aware retrieval strategies are important; DRIFT demonstrates the value of decomposing problems and adding illustrative guidance for effective autoformalization, but effectiveness varies with model capabilities and knowledge boundaries.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

### [576] [The Irrational Machine: Neurosis and the Limits of Algorithmic Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10823)
*Daniel Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to diagnose 'neurosis' in embodied AI, cataloging recurring maladaptive modalities, with online detectors and escape policies; shows local fixes fail and advocates genetic-programming destructive testing to reveal when architecture must change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and remediate misaligned but internally coherent behaviors arising from planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory in embodied AI; to surface structural issues rather than patch symptoms.

Method: Build a grid-navigation stack; catalog modalities (flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis, hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie-break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsions, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants); implement lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies; use First/Second/Third Law as shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency; conduct genetic-programming-based destructive testing to generate adversarial worlds and perturbations that maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding curricula and counterfactual traces to reveal architectural revision needs.

Result: Durable phobic avoidance can persist even with full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, causing long detours despite globally safe routes; local fixes are insufficient and global failures can remain hidden.

Conclusion: Global failures require architectural revisions rather than mere symptom patches; the authors propose adversarial, genetic-programming testing to surface where redesign is needed and to produce traces that guide architectural change.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

### [577] [LLM-Empowered Agentic MAC Protocols: A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10895)
*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Shaoyun Wu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-powered MARL framework models uplink MAC as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game, using PPO-guided agents and a protocol grammar to adapt to varying user counts, achieving substantial throughput and fairness gains with no retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MAC tuning is inflexible and DRL-based approaches struggle with generalization to changing environments; a scalable, generalizable framework is needed that leverages game theory and large language models to adapt MAC behavior.

Method: Formulate uplink MAC with a dynamic MFSG where base station followers (UEs) and leaders interact. Use LLM-driven agents coordinated by PPO to synthesize adaptive MAC actions. Employ Protocol Action Grammar (PAG) for reliable action selection. Analyze Stackelberg equilibrium existence and convergence via learning dynamics of unified LLM policies as followers change. Validate through simulations, comparing against baselines.

Result: Significant performance gains: 77.6% higher throughput and 65.2% better fairness over conventional baselines. Demonstrates strong generalization to fluctuating user counts without retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-empowered MFSG framework provides a robust, scalable approach to adaptive MAC design that maintains performance under dynamic network conditions, reducing the need for retraining and enabling better generalization.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

### [578] [PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10909)
*Daoyu Wang,Mingyue Cheng,Qi Liu,Shuo Yu,Zirui Liu,Ze Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaperArena is a benchmark and platform for evaluating cross-paper reasoning with multi-tool orchestration in scientific literature; it reveals current LLM-powered agents underperform and misuse tools, and provides data/code for community adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool use in real research tasks, enabling standardized evaluation of agents that integrate information across multiple papers and tools.

Method: Introduce PaperArena benchmark and a modular execution platform with tools (multimodal parsing, context retrieval, programmatic computation) to tackle real research questions requiring cross-paper integration and tool interaction.

Result: State-of-the-art LLM-powered agents achieve 38.78% average accuracy on PaperArena, dropping to 18.47% on a hard subset; results show inefficient tool usage with agents invoking more tools than necessary.

Conclusion: PaperArena provides a baseline and platform for evaluating scientific discovery agents; invites community adoption; code and data available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

### [579] [PoU: Proof-of-Use to Counter Tool-Call Hacking in DeepResearch Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10931)
*SHengjie Ma,Chenlong Deng,Jiaxin Mao,Jiadeng Huang,Teng Wang,Junjie Wu,Changwang Zhang,Jun wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PoU is an evidence-grounded RL framework that prevents Tool-Call Hacking in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents by enforcing verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers, via syntax-citation checks, perturbation-based rewards, and answer-evidence alignment; it improves factuality and grounding across seven QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A failure mode called Tool-Call Hacking causes RL-trained RAG agents to inflate rewards with superficially correct tool calls, leading to mode collapse (relying on a single source) and spurious grounding (weakly supported answers). There is a need to ensure agents genuinely use retrieved evidence and expose causal links between evidence and answers.

Method: Introduce Proof-of-Use (PoU), a unified step-wise contract that combines: (1) syntactic citation validation to ensure retrieved sources are properly cited, (2) perturbation-based sensitivity rewards to reward robust reliance on evidence, and (3) answer-evidence alignment objectives to ensure final answers align with cited evidence. This enforces interpretable and grounded tool usage.

Result: Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance.

Conclusion: Ground RL agents not just on task outcomes but on the causal use of retrieved information; PoU provides a principled path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning and mitigates Tool-Call Hacking.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

### [580] [Scalable and Explainable Enterprise Knowledge Discovery Using Graph-Centric Hybrid Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10942)
*Nilima Rao,Jagriti Srivastava,Pradeep Kumar Sharma,Hritvik Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular hybrid retrieval framework that builds a unified knowledge graph from enterprise artifacts (code, PRs, commits) and uses adaptive, graph-based reasoning (KBLam, DeepGraph, embeddings) to enable multi-hop, explainable answers with interactive visualization; it outperforms standalone GPT-based pipelines by up to 80% in relevance on large Git repos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises store knowledge across heterogeneous systems (Jira, Git, Confluence, wikis). Traditional keyword search and static embeddings fail for complex, context-driven, multi-hop queries that require cross-artifact reasoning.

Method: Construct a unified knowledge graph from parsed repositories (code, pull requests, commit histories). Integrate Knowledge Base Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and embedding-driven semantic search. Use dynamic query analysis to select retrieval strategies (structured/unstructured data, independent or fused processing). Provide an interactive interface with graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to produce concise, explainable answers.

Result: Empirical evaluation on large-scale Git repositories shows the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by up to 80% compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric foundation for intelligent enterprise knowledge assistants by combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

### [581] [Video-STR: Reinforcing MLLMs in Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning with Relation Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10976)
*Wentao Wang,Heqing Zou,Tianze Luo,Rui Huang,Yutian Zhao,Zhuochen Wang,Hansheng Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Yan Wang,Lin Zhao,Huaijian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Video-STR introduces a graph-based reinforcement approach for precise video spatio-temporal reasoning, leveraging RLVR with Graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a new STV-205k dataset. It achieves state-of-the-art results on STI-Bench (≈13% improvement) and promises released code, model, and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models excel at semantic understanding but struggle with precise spatio-temporal reasoning. They often ignore physical video information (object layouts, motion), limiting use in high-precision tasks like embodied intelligence and VR. There is a need for methods that infer the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenes.

Method: Proposes Video-STR, a graph-based reinforcement framework using RLVR (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward) and a Graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to guide the model in inferring spatio-temporal topology during reasoning. Addresses data scarcity by constructing STV-205k, a 205k-question dataset covering dynamic multi-object scenes in indoor and outdoor environments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on STI-Bench, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench. Demonstrates effectiveness of the GRPO+RLVR approach and the STV-205k dataset.

Conclusion: Video-STR effectively enhances precise video spatio-temporal reasoning in MLLMs. The combination of graph-based policy optimization and a large, diverse training dataset enables substantial performance gains and supports future research with released code, model, and data.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

### [582] [Revisiting Model Interpolation for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10977)
*Taiqiang Wu,Runming Yang,Tao Liu,Jiahao Wang,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simple weight interpolation method for merging instruction/Thinking models reveals a three-stage evolution in the reasoning trajectory, offering favorable efficiency–performance trade-offs and even surpassing complex merging baselines; validated by extensive ablations and decoding studies with a practical framework and public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether a straightforward weight interpolation can rival or exceed sophisticated model-merging approaches, and to reveal the dynamics of how interpolation affects reasoning capabilities and resource costs, enabling targeted improvements.

Method: Direct interpolation of two pretrained model weights, followed by analysis of its reasoning trajectory divided into three stages. Systematic ablations across layers, modules, and decoding strategies, and comparisons against advanced merging baselines to assess performance and efficiency. Codebase available for replication.

Result: A strategically interpolated model can outperform sophisticated merging baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness. The three-stage dynamics guide how to balance performance and cost. Ablation results show robustness across layers, modules, and decoding settings, supporting a practical framework for targeted reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Model interpolation emerges as a demystified, practical tool for engineering models with precisely targeted reasoning abilities. The work provides actionable guidance and a framework for tailoring reasoning capabilities via simple interpolation, with empirical support and accessible code.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

### [583] [FBS Model-based Maintenance Record Accumulation for Failure-Cause Inference in Manufacturing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11003)
*Takuma Fujiu,Sho Okazaki,Kohei Kaminishi,Yuji Nakata,Shota Hamamoto,Kenshin Yokose,Tatsunori Hara,Yasushi Umeda,Jun Ota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and FBS-based maintenance-record accumulation to improve failure-cause inference in manufacturing. It achieves better agreement with expert-candidate causes, especially in data-scarce or vocabulary-divergent cases, with plans for UI and broader validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance knowledge-based failure-cause inference by explicitly structuring knowledge about the target system and failures and by building long causal failure chains through maintenance records, enabling knowledge sharing across the engineering chain.

Method: Construct a Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and propose a Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation method; apply the method to infer failure causes from accumulated maintenance records; evaluate against expert-identified candidate causes, noting improvements in difficult cases.

Result: Failure-cause inferences using the proposed maintenance records show better agreement with expert-candidate causes, particularly when the number of related cases is small and vocabulary differs.

Conclusion: The approach leverages design-phase knowledge to support maintenance-phase knowledge accumulation and problem solving, laying a foundation for knowledge sharing across the engineering chain; future work includes tailored inference methods for maintenance records, a user interface, and validation on larger/diverse systems.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

### [584] [Argumentation-Based Explainability for Legal AI: Comparative and Regulatory Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11079)
*Andrada Iulia Prajescu,Roberto Confalonieri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Computational argumentation provides a robust framework for explainable legal AI, aligning with GDPR/AIA; it foregrounds defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive aspects of law, but requires work on bias, empirical validation, and regulatory alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal AI systems are increasingly deployed but remain opaque, undermining fairness, accountability, and trust. The paper argues for explanations that meet legal and normative requirements under GDPR and the AI Act.

Method: Review and compare explanation strategies (example-based, rule-based, hybrid, and argumentation-based). Analyze their applicability to legal reasoning and regulatory compliance; advocate for computational argumentation as a foundation for explainable legal AI; outline strengths, limitations, and open challenges.

Result: Argues that argumentation frameworks capture the defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive nature of law and thus offer a robust basis for explainable legal AI. Provides a critical evaluation of explanation strategies, and highlights open challenges such as bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial settings, and regulatory compliance.

Conclusion: Computational argumentation is well positioned to meet both technical and normative transparency requirements in law; calls for ongoing research on bias mitigation, empirical validation, and alignment with evolving ethical and legal standards.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Motivation: Quantify macroeconomic effects of AI-driven production and human–AI co-creation, and compare China and the US under various AI mechanisms to inform policy design.

Method: Simulation-based analysis using a pre-existing multi-level intelligent agent economic model; scenarios compare AI collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production.

Result: (1) If AI acts as an independent productive entity, total social output growth outpaces traditional labor-based models; (2) China shows clear potential for accelerated growth in intelligent agent populations and faster technological catch-up, with prospects for convergence or partial surpassing.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic, model-based analytical framework to understand AI-driven production transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, with quantitative insights for policy formulation.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

*Andrea Marinoni,Sai Shivareddy,Pietro Lio',Weisi Lin,Erik Cambria,Clare Grey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic power management for AI data centers by making part of input power as flexible as compute power; compares passive and active devices; analyzes power trends globally to assess impact on energy efficiency, capex, and management costs; suggests substantial sustainability gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI data centers consume large amounts of power; robust and sustainable power management is essential to unlock scalable AI while minimizing environmental and financial costs.

Method: Quantify performance of passive vs. active power devices; analyze power trends from multiple data platforms worldwide; assess effects on computational gain, energy efficiency, capex reduction, and management costs; present a paradigm shift in power management strategy.

Result: The strategy shows potential for strong sustainability improvements for AI hyperscalers; provides quantitative analyses of energy and cost benefits across platforms; demonstrates trade-offs between device types and dynamic input power.

Conclusion: Dynamic input power management could be a paradigm shift enabling more sustainable AI data centers, with environmental, financial, and societal benefits.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

### [587] [Spec-Driven AI for Science: The ARIA Framework for Automated and Reproducible Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11143)
*Chuke Chen,Biao Luo,Nan Li,Boxiang Wang,Hang Yang,Jing Guo,Ming Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARIA is a spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework that automates interpretable data analysis by unifying six layers into a document-centric workflow, enabling automatic code generation, validation, and transparent documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a widening gap between data abundance and analytical capability; current AI tools trade transparency for automation or require manual scripting, limiting scalability and reproducibility.

Method: Introduce ARIA with six interoperable layers (Command, Context, Code, Data, Orchestration, AI Module) and a doc-centric workflow; use natural-language specifications to drive automated code generation, computation validation, and production of interpretable documentation; demonstrate via Boston Housing case and cross-domain evaluations.

Result: Achieved high predictive accuracy, efficient feature selection and model choice with minimal overfitting; Boston Housing case found 25 key features and XGBoost performing best (R^2 = 0.93); across heterogeneous domains ARIA outperformed state-of-the-art systems in interpretability and efficiency.

Conclusion: ARIA offers a new paradigm for transparent, collaborative, reproducible scientific discovery by integrating AI for research with AI for science principles in a spec-driven architecture.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

### [588] [$How^{2}$: How to learn from procedural How-to questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11144)
*Gautier Dagan,Frank Keller,Alex Lascarides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces How^2, a memory-augmented framework enabling how-to questions for lifelong learning in interactive environments; in Minecraft crafting task, abstracted answers decoupled from current state yield the best planning improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents face uncertainty in planning; how-to questions range from executable actions to high-level subgoals, making them hard to answer. A mechanism is needed to ask, store, and reuse such knowledge across tasks to improve planning over time.

Method: Proposes How^2 memory agent; integrates asking how-to questions, storing answers, and reusing for lifelong learning. Uses teacher models that answer at multiple abstraction levels, from executable sequences to subgoal-level descriptions. Evaluation conducted in Plancraft (Minecraft crafting) where the agent completes an assembly task.

Result: Lifelong learning agents benefit most from abstracted, decoupled answers; How^2 enables information to be reused to improve planning capabilities over time.

Conclusion: How^2 provides a viable path for LLM-based agents to improve planning in interactive environments by asking, storing, and reusing how-to knowledge; abstracted answers decoupled from current state are especially effective.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

### [589] [Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11194)
*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDRA reframes LLM alignment as a critique-driven, structured reasoning task, introducing the DeepPref benchmark and Pers-GenPRM, and a process-level RL method (Critique-Driven Policy Alignment) that uses critique chains to align responses with user preferences, achieving more accurate and defensible reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment methods struggle to infer deep implicit user preferences (unstated goals, context, risk tolerance) and lack defensive reasoning to handle real-world ambiguity, leading to superficial or brittle outputs.

Method: 1) Propose CDRA framework that replaces scalar reward with structured critique-driven reasoning. 2) DeepPref benchmark: 3000 preference-query pairs across 20 topics, generated by a cognitive council producing critique-annotated reasoning chains to reveal latent risks. 3) Pers-GenPRM: a personalized reward model that generates a critique chain to evaluate alignment before outputting a final score. 4) Critique-Driven Policy Alignment: online RL algorithm that uses both numerical and natural language feedback for policy optimization.

Result: Experiments show CDRA effectively discovers and aligns with users' true preferences and supports robust, defensive reasoning; code and dataset are released.

Conclusion: CDRA provides an interpretable, structured reward signal to guide policy training, improving alignment with user preferences and resilience in reasoning; encourages safer, more user-centric LLM interactions.

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

### [590] [AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235)
*Leonard Dung,Florian Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defense-in-depth in AI alignment is analyzed by mapping 7 techniques against 7 failure modes to gauge overlap and inform risk and research prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether multiple alignment defenses provide robust safety when their failure modes might be correlated, and to guide where to focus future alignment research.

Method: Qualitative/analytical analysis mapping 7 representative alignment techniques to 7 identified failure modes, evaluating overlap and potential correlations; discussion of implications.

Result: The abstract does not present numeric results; it asserts that the analysis yields insights into the extent of overlap between techniques and failure modes and discusses implications for risk assessment and prioritization.

Conclusion: Defense-in-depth effectiveness depends on uncorrelated failure modes; the work highlights how overlap informs current risk levels and helps prioritize future AI alignment research.

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

### [591] [PADME: Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11281)
*Deepeka Garg,Sihan Zeng,Annapoorani L. Narayanan,Sumitra Ganesh,Leo Ardon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PADME develops an autonomous, graph-based representation of procedures to guide long-horizon tasks, achieving SOTA on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free-form procedural instructions (recipes, protocols, workflows) are rich but unstructured, causing LLM-based agents to drift or fail during execution. A structured, reusable procedure model can provide reliability and generalization.

Method: PADME uses a two-phase Teach and Execute framework. It autonomously transforms procedural text into executable graphs that encode task dependencies, decision points, and reusable subroutines. Teach phase systematically structures and enriches procedures with executable logic; Execute phase dynamically executes with real-time inputs and environmental feedback. The graph acts as an inductive bias to reduce error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning and enables reuse across contexts.

Result: PADME achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, demonstrating that graph-based procedure representations improve robustness and generalization for agent-driven execution.

Conclusion: Structured procedure modeling via graph representations is a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust, scalable autonomous execution; separating Teach and Execute enhances quality and reuse of expert knowledge across contexts.

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

*Sheng Jin,Haoming Wang,Zhiqi Gao,Yongbo Yang,Bao Chunjia,Chengliang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes AI-Agent School (AAS), a self-evolving LLM-based agent framework for simulating complex educational dynamics using a zero-exp strategy and an experience-reflection-optimization loop with dual memory, yielding high-fidelity behavioral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmented teaching-process modeling and limitations in agent performance when simulating diverse educational participants.

Method: Introduce AAS with a zero-exp strategy and a continuous experience-reflection-optimization cycle, built on a dual memory base (experience and knowledge bases) with short-term and long-term memory components, enabling autonomous evolution via situated interactions in varied school scenarios.

Result: Experiments indicate AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and foster advanced agent cognitive abilities, generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Conclusion: AAS provides a foundational stepping stone from the Era of Experience to the Era of Simulation, enabling high-fidelity simulations of educational dynamics and improved understanding of teacher-student interactions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

### [593] [Automated Skill Decomposition Meets Expert Ontologies: Bridging the Granularity Gap with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11313)
*Le Ngoc Luyen,Marie-Hélène Abel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an ontology-grounded evaluation framework for LLM-based skill decomposition, with semantic and hierarchy-aware F1 metrics, validated on a curated benchmark; finds zero-shot is a strong baseline, while leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars stabilizes phrasing and hierarchy, with exemplar prompts sometimes offering competitive latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how well LLM-generated skill decompositions align with structured ontologies, addressing content accuracy and hierarchical placement; existing metrics不足 in ontology-aware evaluation and hierarchy capture.

Method: Standardize the end-to-end pipeline (prompting, generation, normalization, ontology alignment). Propose semantic F1 (embedding-based content accuracy) and hierarchy-aware F1 (structural granularity). Evaluate across multiple LLMs using zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars; conduct latency analysis to compare prompting strategies.

Result: Zero-shot provides a strong baseline; few-shot with exemplars improves phrasing stability and granularity, and enhances hierarchy-aware alignment. Exemplar-guided prompts can be competitive or faster due to more schema-compliant outputs. The framework, benchmark, and metrics enable reproducible ontology-faithful skill-decomposition systems.

Conclusion: Proposes a reproducible foundation for ontology-faithful skill decomposition, including a benchmark (ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill) and two alignment metrics, facilitating future research and practical deployment.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

*Abdullah Al Mahmud,Prangon Chowdhury,Mohammed Borhan Uddin,Khaled Eabne Delowar,Tausifur Rahman Talha,Bijoy Dewanjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review of AI for anemia detection; evaluates ML/DL models using standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anemia is widespread; accurate/early diagnosis is crucial; AI can enhance detection and classification.

Method: Review of recent ML/DL studies on anemia detection; compare models using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision.

Result: Models show varying performance; some achieve high accuracy but generalizability and data quality are concerns; tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity observed; limitations include dataset heterogeneity, lack of standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: AI approaches hold promise for anemia diagnosis but require robust datasets, standardized evaluation, and interpretability to translate to clinical practice.

Abstract: Anemia, a condition marked by insufficient levels of red blood cells or
hemoglobin, remains a widespread health issue affecting millions of individuals
globally. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for effective management
and treatment of anemia. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
the use of artificial intelligence techniques, i.e., machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) for the detection, classification, and diagnosis of anemia.
This paper provides a systematic review of the recent advancements in this
field, with a focus on various models applied to anemia detection. The review
also compares these models based on several performance metrics, including
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. By analyzing these metrics,
the paper evaluates the strengths and limitation of discussed models in
detecting and classifying anemia, emphasizing the importance of addressing
these factors to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### [595] [From <Answer> to <Think>: Multidimensional Supervision of Reasoning Process for LLM Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11457)
*Beining Wang,Weihang Su,Hongtao Tian,Tao Yang,Yujia Zhou,Ting Yao,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multidimensional supervision framework (DRM) for LLM multi-step reasoning using three interpretable dimensions—Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence—to assess reasoning quality beyond final answer accuracy. It bridges outcome-based RL and process-based PRMs, providing denser, interpretable feedback without ground-truth solutions and improving generalization across math, QA, code, and puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either rely on outcome-only rewards (RLVR) which propagate flawed reasoning and sparse feedback, or rely on process-rich but task-specific PRMs which lack generalizability and interpretability. There is a need for a general, component-wise, interpretable supervision that guides reasoning without requiring ground-truth intermediate steps.

Method: Introduce Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM) that evaluates a reasoning process along three dimensions: Confidence (uncertainty calibration), Relevance (semantic alignment with the task), and Coherence (logical consistency). These dimension scores supervision the training of LLMs without ground-truth answers. DRM is applied to open-domain tasks spanning mathematics, QA, code execution, and puzzles, showing improvements in reasoning ability both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.

Result: DRM provides effective, denser supervision signals that guide LLM optimization and improve multi-step reasoning. Empirical results show consistent gains on diverse open-domain tasks (math, QA, code, puzzles) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, indicating better generalized reasoning capabilities beyond the training distribution.

Conclusion: Multidimensional supervision of reasoning (Confidence, Relevance, Coherence) can enhance generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond training distribution without requiring ground-truth intermediate steps, addressing limitations of traditional outcome-only RL and task-specific PRMs.

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

### [596] [Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11462)
*Yisen Gao,Jiaxin Bai,Yi Huang,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified masked diffusion framework DARK for joint deductive and abductive reasoning on knowledge graphs, featuring self-reflective denoising for hypothesis refinement and logic-exploration RL with query/conclusion masking, achieving SOTA on both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deduction and abduction offer complementary reasoning capabilities but are usually addressed separately; bridging them could validate hypotheses and uncover deeper patterns; a unified model could leverage bidirectional query–conclusion relations.

Method: A masked diffusion model (DARK) that captures bidirectional query–conclusion relations. Innovations: (1) self-reflective denoising that alternately generates and validates hypotheses against the conclusion; (2) logic-exploration reinforcement learning that masks queries and conclusions to discover novel reasoning compositions.

Result: In experiments across multiple benchmark knowledge graphs, DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, showing the benefits of the unified approach.

Conclusion: A unified DARK framework effectively integrates deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs, offering improved performance and suggesting broader potential for synergistic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes zero data retention policies for enterprise AI assistants, comparing architectures, governance, and usability across major vendors (Salesforce, Microsoft) and LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy and compliance concerns in healthcare/finance; need to safeguard private data while boosting productivity via AI assistants; explore if zero data retention can be achieved in enterprise deployments.

Method: Architectural and trade-off analysis of zero data retention implementations; case studies of Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot; evaluation of how consuming apps and LLM service providers implement or enable zero data retention.

Result: Framework of architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs; insights into how to design, deploy, and govern zero data retention policies; comparative observations across providers.

Conclusion: Zero data retention in enterprise AI is feasible but requires balancing data governance, performance, and usability; recommended best practices and policy considerations for both enterprise apps and LLM providers.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

### [598] [Analyzing and Internalizing Complex Policy Documents for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11588)
*Jiateng Liu,Zhenhailong Wang,Xiaojiang Huang,Yingjie Li,Xing Fan,Xiang Li,Chenlei Guo,Ruhi Sarikaya,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Presents CC-Gen, a four-level controllable-complexity benchmark for agentic LLMs, and CAP-CPT, a category-aware continued pretraining method to internalize policy docs into model priors, yielding data-efficient improvements over SFT baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As policy documents expand with business rules, LLM agentic systems incur high computation; internalizing these policies into model priors promises efficiency but is challenging, especially for multi-level, deeply reasoning policies. CoT-guided SFT is data-intensive and degrades with complexity.

Method: Introduce CC-Gen to generate benchmarks with four complexity levels; develop CAP-CPT that parses policy docs into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, isolates complex conditions, and uses autoregressive pretraining with targeted data synthesis to internalize policy information.

Result: CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines across settings; up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B; achieves 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen; enhances tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.

Conclusion: Policy internalization is most challenged by complex workflow specifications; data-intensive CoT annotations degrade with complexity. CAP-CPT provides a data-efficient, targeted pretraining approach that strengthens policy internalization and reduces prompt overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

### [599] [Reproducibility: The New Frontier in AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11595)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Stronger reproducibility standards in AI research are essential for effective governance; preregistration, adequate statistical power, and publication of negative results can clarify AI risk landscapes and empower policymakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policymakers suffer from low signal-to-noise in AI information, rapid publication, and weak reproducibility, undermining governance decisions and risk prioritization.

Method: Conceptual commentary comparing reproducibility crises across domains; argues for preregistration, power, and negative-result protocols; outlines implications for AI governance.

Result: Adopting reproducibility protocols would improve reliability of AI risk assessments and governance decisions, leading to better consensus among policymakers.

Conclusion: Reproducibility should be a core governance tool; governments should demand higher standards, while governance remains reactive to social implications.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

### [600] [Explainability, risk modeling, and segmentation based customer churn analytics for personalized retention in e-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11604)
*Sanjula De Alwis,Indrajith Ekanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a three-component, interpretable framework combining explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM profiling to design personalized retention strategies and identify high-risk segments in online retail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contemporary churn models are often opaque, hindering understanding of what drives attrition, when to intervene, and which customer segments to target. There is a need for interpretable evidence to inform retention actions.

Method: A three-component framework: (1) explainable AI to quantify feature contributions, (2) survival analysis to model time-to-churn risk, and (3) RFM profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour; combined to attribute churn drivers, estimate intervention windows, and prioritize segments for targeted retention actions.

Result: Describes an integrated framework and its intended outputs—driver attribution, intervention timing, and segment prioritization—facilitating actionable retention strategies.

Conclusion: Integrating explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM profiling can guide interpretable, timely, and targeted retention actions that reduce attrition and strengthen customer loyalty.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

### [601] [ParaCook: On Time-Efficient Planning for Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11608)
*Shiqi Zhang,Xinbei Ma,Yunqing Xu,Zouying Cao,Pengrui Lu,Haobo Yuan,Tiancheng Shen,Zhuosheng Zhang,Hai Zhao,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ParaCook is a scalable benchmark for time-efficient collaborative planning in multi-agent LLM settings, inspired by Overcooked, highlighting current LLMs' weaknesses in coordinating parallel actions while enabling high-level parallel optimization on abstract tasks; provides an adjustable framework and public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks emphasize task completion rather than time efficiency in parallel/asynchronous planning; there is a need to evaluate and push LLMs toward time-efficient, coordinated multi-agent planning.

Method: Introduce ParaCook environment with simplified action space for multi-agent cooking-like tasks; instantiate challenging interaction planning problems; vary complexity; evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on planning with attention to parallelism; analyze coordination issues; offer a scalable framework with downloadable data/code.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs produce suboptimal plans, struggle with parallel actions and coordination, though they show potential on abstract tasks where high-level parallel optimization is possible; ParaCook serves as a framework for time-efficiency-aware multi-agent planning evaluation.

Conclusion: ParaCook provides a foundation for developing and assessing time-efficiency-aware multi-agent planning; scalable, adjustable complexity; code and data available at GitHub, enabling broader research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

### [602] [SR-Scientist: Scientific Equation Discovery With Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11661)
*Shijie Xia,Yuhan Sun,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SR-Scientist introduces an autonomous AI scientist framework that enables an LLM to write, run, and optimize equations via coding and data-analysis tools, achieving substantial gains over baselines across four scientific domains and demonstrating robustness and generalization, with an RL-enhanced training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current setups limit LLMs to proposing equations within genetic-programming-like search loops. There is a need for an autonomous agent that can implement, evaluate, and refine equations directly by coding against data, reducing human-driven pipelines and enabling longer-horizon optimization.

Method: Wrap a code interpreter into data-analysis and equation-evaluation tools. The agent writes code to analyze data, implements the equation as code, executes evaluations, and refines the equation over long horizons using feedback from experiments. An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework trains the agent to perform these tasks with minimal human-defined pipelines.

Result: SR-Scientist outperforms baselines by an absolute margin of 6% to 35% on datasets spanning four science disciplines. The approach shows robustness to noise, generalization to out-of-domain data, and preservation of symbolic accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that autonomous scientific discovery is feasible for equation discovery tasks, with LLM-driven code synthesis and long-horizon optimization yielding practical improvements. The end-to-end RL enhancement further strengthens the agent’s capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: We present Operand Quant, a single-agent, IDE-based architecture for
autonomous machine learning engineering (MLE). Operand Quant departs from
conventional multi-agent orchestration frameworks by consolidating all MLE
lifecycle stages -- exploration, modeling, experimentation, and deployment --
within a single, context-aware agent. On the MLE-Benchmark (2025), Operand
Quant achieved a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) result, with an overall medal rate
of 0.3956 +/- 0.0565 across 75 problems -- the highest recorded performance
among all evaluated systems to date. The architecture demonstrates that a
linear, non-blocking agent, operating autonomously within a controlled IDE
environment, can outperform multi-agent and orchestrated systems under
identical constraints.

*Chenhan Lyu,Yutong Song,Pengfei Zhang,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a domain-adapted, Constitutionally-guided AI safety framework for mental-health CAI, aiming to improve crisis handling, guideline adherence, and scalability in sensitive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising global mental illness and the need for scalable, AI-assisted mental health care, coupled with the unique risks of handling sensitive data and vulnerable users that exceed general AI safety safeguards.

Method: Apply Constitutionally guided (Constitutional AI) training using domain-specific mental health principles to develop safe, domain-adapted conversational AI systems for mental health applications.

Result: Introduces a training framework and approach for safe mental-health CAI; the abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: Using mental-health domain principles in Constitutional AI can yield safer, more responsible CAI systems for mental health, but requires future validation of crisis-intervention accuracy, guideline adherence, scalability, and nuanced dialogue handling.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health
applications.
