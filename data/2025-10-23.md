*Nathan Mankovich,Kai-Hendrik Cohrs,Homer Durand,Vasileios Sitokonstantinou,Tristan Williams,Gustau Camps-Valls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A review outlining how dimensionality reduction can address high-dimensional Earth observation data, offering a practical handbook for applying DR across the RS data value chain and highlighting under-explored avenues for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation data are expanding in volume and dimensionality, leading to sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality that hinder machine learning and analysis.

Method: Literature review and synthesis mapping dimensionality reduction techniques to stages of the remote sensing data value chain, producing a handbook and identifying gaps and opportunities.

Result: A handbook-style synthesis guiding DR applications across RS tasks (compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly detection, prediction) and highlighting under-explored DR algorithms and future research directions.

Conclusion: Dimensionality reduction is essential for efficient, effective use of EO data; ongoing exploration of diverse DR algorithms will enhance EO data analysis and decision-making across environmental, societal, and economic applications.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are neurally-generated, visually inconspicuous fiducial markers that enable stealth 6-DoF tracking by printing simple codes on paper and detecting them with RGB cameras. The system jointly trains encoding and detection networks in an end-to-end framework inspired by deep steganography, achieving reliable indoor tracking while blending into real-world textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable location tracking for AR, robotics, and interfaces without conspicuous fiducial markers, improving aesthetics and reducing visual clutter in environments by embedding trackable markers that blend into textures.

Method: An encoder network transforms arbitrary images into Ninja Codes with subtle visual alterations suitable for printing on ordinary paper. A detection network, trained end-to-end with the encoder, decodes and localizes the marker from RGB camera input. The training draws on concepts from deep steganography to jointly optimize creation and detection, and the output is a printable marker that is detectable under typical indoor lighting.

Result: Experiments show reliable 6-DoF tracking under common indoor lighting and successful concealment within diverse environmental textures, suggesting practical viability for stealthy fiducials in AR/robotics and related applications.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes offer a practical, aesthetically unobtrusive alternative to conventional fiducials, expanding where fiducials can be used by blending into environments while preserving detectable geometric information for pose estimation. Further evaluation across devices, lighting, and textures, as well as security/privacy considerations, remain important for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-phase vision-language QA for autonomous driving improves high-level QA by combining history-conditioned prompting, self-consistency, and scene grounding: Phase-1 uses a multimodal LLM with six cameras and chain-of-thought with few-shot exemplars plus self-consistency; Phase-2 adds NuScenes scene metadata and task-specific prompts to push performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable, high-level question answering for autonomous driving by leveraging pretrained vision-language models with structured grounding, history context, and reasoning ensembles to improve accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions.

Method: Phase-1: Condition a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) on six-camera inputs, short history, and chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot exemplars; apply a self-consistency ensemble over multiple sampled reasoning chains. Phase-2: Augment prompts with NuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego state, etc.) and category-specific instructions for perception, prediction, and planning tasks.

Result: On a driving QA benchmark, Phase-1 with 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs 62.61% zero-shot); self-consistency raises to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. The system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can substantially improve high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models, with robustness to visual degradation.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous-time state-space model (Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D) for irregularly timed longitudinal imaging that jointly models spatial and temporal cues with linear complexity, achieving improved breast cancer risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal radiological analysis faces a core data challenge: high-resolution images captured at irregular intervals, requiring preservation of spatial and temporal cues. Existing methods either collapse spatial information into vectors or apply spatio-temporal models that are computationally heavy and incompatible with non-uniform time steps.

Method: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a state-space architecture tailored for longitudinal medical imaging. It includes a continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates true inter-exam time differences into state transitions and a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module to robustly capture spatio-temporal relationships, all with linear complexity.

Result: On a breast cancer risk prediction benchmark using sequential screening mammograms, the model shows superior performance, improving validation c-index by 2–5 percentage points and achieving higher 1–5 year AUC scores relative to established variants of recurrent, transformer, and state-space models, while enabling efficient processing of long patient histories.

Conclusion: The work introduces a new framework for longitudinal image analysis that effectively handles irregular visit times and rich spatio-temporal cues, offering improved predictive performance and scalability.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-centric alignment approach learns a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder, predicts optical flow, and aligns diffusion model latent features to this subspace to improve motion plausibility without harming prompt fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models struggle with temporal coherence and physical plausibility due to entangled appearance–motion features from pretrained encoders. A dedicated motion subspace can better capture true dynamics.

Method: Extract a disentangled motion subspace from a pretrained video encoder, train it to predict ground-truth optical flow, and align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this subspace to inject motion knowledge.

Result: Improved physical commonsense in a state-of-the-art video diffusion model; maintained adherence to textual prompts. Validated via experiments on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, VBench-2.0 and supported by a user study.

Conclusion: Motion-focused disentangled subspace learning enables diffusion models to internalize motion dynamics more effectively, yielding more plausible videos while preserving prompt alignment.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh uses scene-graph rubrics and LLMs-as-a-Judge to score detailed image descriptions, validated on DOCENT; shows better alignment with human judgments than baselines, robust across image types, and a challenging domain for evaluating VLM progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics like CIDEr/SPICE target short descriptions and miss fine-grained, compositional errors in long texts; there is a need for evaluators that localize errors and reflect human judgments for detailed image descriptions, especially in domains with rich scene dynamics.

Method: PoSh employs scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide an LLM-based judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained errors. It is validated on the DOCENT dataset (artworks with expert references and model-generated descriptions, annotated with granular judgments) and tested for robustness on CapArena. Comparisons include open-weight baselines and GPT-4o-as-a-judge; PoSh is also shown to function well as a reward signal.

Result: PoSh achieves stronger correlations with human judgments in DOCENT (+0.05 Spearman ρ) than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type, and outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning as a reward signal. The analysis indicates foundation models still struggle to achieve fully accurate coverage of images with rich scene dynamics.

Conclusion: PoSh and the DOCENT benchmark together enable progress in detailed image description metrics and evaluation, highlighting a demanding new task for VLMs and with potential benefits for assistive text generation.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR proposes a unified pose representation learning pipeline aligning image, 2D, 3D pose embeddings via a singular value-based contrastive loss; demonstrates improved cross-modal alignment for HPE and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmentation among pose representations across modalities; enable unified embeddings to improve multi-modal fusion, generation, and downstream Human-Centric tasks.

Method: A unified pipeline that aligns image, 2D pose, and 3D pose embeddings; introduces a singular value-based contrastive loss to better align modalities; uses a simple 3D pose decoder; evaluates on Human3.6M and 3DPW for 2D/3D HPE and cross-domain retrieval on Human3.6M.

Result: Achieves MPJPE 49.9 mm and PA-MPJPE 51.6 mm in cross-domain evaluation; retrieves 2D/3D poses with MPJPE error 9.24 mm on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: Unified pose representations across modalities improve cross-domain alignment and enable accurate 2D/3D pose estimation and retrieval; the singular value-based contrastive loss enhances multi-modal alignment.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

*Eyad Gad,Seif Soliman,M. Saeed Darweesh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention-enhanced 3D U-Net for brain tumor segmentation with imbalance-aware detection on BraTS 2020; achieves high dice, specificity, and sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome irregular tumor shapes and boundary ambiguity in 3D MRI segmentation; address high computational demands and class imbalance on high-resolution BraTS data.

Method: Integrates an attention mechanism into a 3D U-Net; adds a tumor-detection algorithm based on digital image processing to mitigate data imbalance.

Result: Dice = 0.975; Specificity = 0.988; Sensitivity = 0.995 on BraTS 2020; claims outperformance of related studies.

Conclusion: Proposed model improves segmentation reliability for clinical diagnosis; further validation on diverse datasets is needed; potential to aid reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

### [9] [A Novel Approach to Breast Cancer Segmentation using U-Net Model with Attention Mechanisms and FedProx](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19118)
*Eyad Gad,Mustafa Abou Khatwa,Mustafa A. Elattar,Sahar Selim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedProx-based federated learning with an attention-enhanced U-Net improves non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer segmentation accuracy while preserving privacy, achieving a 96% global model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of breast cancer is crucial; ultrasound is cost-effective but privacy-preserving ML is challenging when data is distributed across institutions (non-IID). High-accuracy tumor boundary delineation is essential for segmentation tasks.

Method: Apply Federated Proximal (FedProx) to non-IID ultrasonic breast cancer imaging datasets and enhance the segmentation model with a modified U-Net incorporating attention mechanisms.

Result: The global federated model achieved 96% accuracy in segmentation, demonstrating FedProx's effectiveness in training precise models on non-IID medical data and improving tumor delineation while preserving patient privacy.

Conclusion: FedProx is a promising approach for privacy-preserving, accurate medical image analysis on non-IID datasets, with potential to improve clinical BC segmentation performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

### [10] [X-Ego: Acquiring Team-Level Tactical Situational Awareness via Cross-Egocentric Contrastive Video Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19150)
*Yunzhe Wang,Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces X-Ego-CS, a cross-egocentric CS2 gameplay dataset with synchronized first-person perspectives and state-action data, and CECL, a cross-ego contrastive learning method to align teammates' egocentric streams to improve team situational awareness. Evaluated on teammate–opponent location prediction from a single view; code and data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study multi-agent decision-making from individual, egocentric perspectives in complex 3D environments. Existing video understanding relies on third-person views and often ignores synchronous egocentric data; esports offers a rich testbed for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Method: Create X-Ego-CS with 124 hours of gameplay from 45 professional CS2 matches, providing cross-egocentric video streams (all players' first-person views) and state-action trajectories. Propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to align teammates' egocentric streams, fostering team-aware representations from an individual's perspective. Evaluate CECL on a teammate–opponent location prediction task using state-of-the-art video encoders.

Result: CECL improves the ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-egocentric alignment. The dataset and method benchmark multi-agent learning in esports.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL provide a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports and have broader implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human–AI teaming in virtual and real domains. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Result: FootFormer achieves statistically significant improvements or equivalence for foot pressure distributions, contact maps, and CoM vs existing methods; it also achieves state-of-the-art performance for stability-predictive components used in kinesiology metrics.

Conclusion: FootFormer advances vision-to-stability estimation by jointly predicting multiple biomechanics targets; code and data are publicly available, enabling further research and potential applications in biomechanics, sports, and robotics.

Abstract: We propose FootFormer, a cross-modality approach for jointly predicting human
motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as
compared with existing methods that generate one or two of those measures.
Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

### [12] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models applied to malaria cell image classification; Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet achieve top accuracy on a public dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce manual misdiagnosis and dependency on expert technicians by using automatic malaria detection from blood smear images.

Method: Compared six deep CNNs (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) on a public malaria cell image dataset to extract deep features and classify cells as infected or healthy.

Result: Residual Attention Network: 97.28% accuracy; XceptionNet: 97.55% accuracy; both outperform other methods on the same dataset.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based automatic malaria diagnosis is promising for reliable and less labor-intensive detection, potentially suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

### [13] [PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183)
*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal is a training-free token-pruning method that improves hallucination mitigation in multi-modal LLMs by focusing attention on informative visual tokens via adaptive KV-cache pruning, with negligible cost, model-agnostic, and demonstrated on benchmarks across four MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs stem from dispersed attention due to redundant visual tokens; reducing token clutter can help focus on critical cues.

Method: Adaptive KV-cache pruning (token pruning) applied during inference, training-free, integrates with decoders; model-agnostic; no extra data needed.

Result: Outperforms baselines on hallucination benchmarks across four mainstream MLLMs; robust results; negligible extra cost; code will be released.

Conclusion: PruneHal provides a simple, effective, training-free solution for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, with broad compatibility and potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

### [14] [Video Consistency Distance: Enhancing Temporal Consistency for Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Based Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19193)
*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video Consistency Distance (VCD) to improve temporal coherence in I2V diffusion generation by optimizing a frequency-domain temporal metric within a reward-based fine-tuning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal inconsistency remains a bottleneck in I2V video generation when using reward-based fine-tuning; existing rewards focus on global quality and aesthetics, not frame-to-frame coherence; aims to enhance temporal consistency without requiring real-world video data.

Method: Define VCD in the frequency space of video frame features to capture temporal information; incorporate VCD as a reward in the existing fine-tuning framework; evaluate across multiple I2V datasets showing improved temporal consistency without degrading other metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning with VCD significantly improves temporal consistency across multiple datasets compared to prior methods, without harming other performance metrics.

Conclusion: VCD provides an effective, dataset-agnostic temporal-consistency metric for reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models, enabling better coherence in I2V video generation.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive is a synthetic data pipeline to boost downstream perception in autonomous driving by editing multi-view videos with 3D-aware guidance maps and a 3D asset dataset; demonstrates improvements across training epochs and enables scalable corner-case generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current work often emphasizes generation quality and controllability while under-emphasizing downstream perception performance; Dream4Drive targets this gap by providing a scalable synthetic data framework and a dataset to quantify benefits for perception tasks (especially corner cases).

Method: Decomposes input video into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto these maps, and fine-tunes the driving world model to produce edited, multi-view photorealistic videos; uses these videos to train downstream perception models; introduces DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset covering typical driving categories to enable diverse 3D-aware video editing.

Result: Experiments show downstream perception models benefit from Dream4Drive across various training epochs; synthetic data yields notable gains, particularly for corner-case scenarios; framework allows generating multi-view corner cases at scale increasing perception robustness.

Conclusion: Dream4Drive provides a practical, scalable approach to leverage synthetic data for improving downstream perception in autonomous driving, supports systematic evaluation of perception performance, and contributes DriveObj3D to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

*In-Hwan Jin,Hyeongju Mun,Joonsoo Kim,Kugjin Yun,Kyeongbo Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-GS introduces a Mixture-of-Experts framework for dynamic Gaussian splatting, using a Volume-aware Pixel Router to blend Gaussian-level weights in pixel space. It improves rendering quality across scenes, with efficiency gains via single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware pruning, and a distillation strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on N3V and Technicolor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic scene reconstruction via 3D Gaussian splatting lacks a single robust approach, showing inconsistent performance across diverse scenes. A unified, adaptive framework is needed to handle varied dynamic challenges.

Method: A unified Mixture-of-Experts framework (MoE-GS) with a Volume-aware Pixel Router that projects volumetric Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight splatting, enabling adaptive blending of expert outputs. To improve efficiency, the paper proposes (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and (2) a distillation strategy to transfer MoE performance to individual experts for lightweight deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on the N3V and Technicolor datasets show MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, with improved efficiency thanks to the proposed pruning, single-pass rendering, and distillation techniques.

Conclusion: MoE-GS is the first approach to integrate Mixture-of-Experts with dynamic Gaussian splatting, demonstrating superior performance across dynamic scenes while offering practical deployment paths through pruning and distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/MoE-GS-68BA/.

### [17] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion uses surface-fitting to fuse camera and 4D imaging radar for 3D object detection, deriving dense depth and BEV features to improve detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sparsity and low resolution impede accurate 3D geometry and cross-modal fusion; explicit surface modeling can enhance spatial representation and depth estimation for better fusion.

Method: Estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data via a surface-fitting module; uses the surface to obtain depth, guiding PV-to-BEV feature transformation and a surface pseudo-point branch to generate a dense pseudo-point cloud; the original radar points are encoded in a separate radar branch; both use pillar-based BEV encoding followed by a standard 2D backbone and detection head.

Result: Outperforms baselines on the TJ4DRadSet and VoD benchmarks, demonstrating effective camera-4D radar fusion.

Conclusion: Surface-fitting guidance improves cross-modal interaction and spatial representation, enabling more reliable dense depth estimation and more accurate 3D object detection.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

*Xiaoqing Lan,Biqiao Xin,Bingshu Wang,Han Zhang,Laixian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The work combines single-frame wavelet-based enhancement with multi-frame trajectory completion via Hungarian matching to improve GEO space-object detection, achieving 90.14% F1 on SpotGEO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geostationary space objects are difficult to detect due to weak signals, cluttered star fields, and environmental interference; robust cross-frame tracking and reliable suppression of false/missing detections are needed.

Method: 1) Apply wavelet transform to each frame to boost high-frequency GEO targets while suppressing background noise; 2) Use the Hungarian algorithm to perform globally optimal cross-frame matching for trajectory completion across frames; 3) In post-processing, apply temporal matching/interpolation, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on the SpotGEO dataset with an F1 score of 90.14%.

Conclusion: The approach synergistically combines frame-level feature enhancement with cross-frame trajectory optimization and noise filtering, yielding strong detection performance and improved robustness to missing/false detections on public data.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

### [19] [Background Fades, Foreground Leads: Curriculum-Guided Background Pruning for Efficient Foreground-Centric Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19250)
*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead is a foreground-centric collaborative perception framework that learns to encode background context into compact foreground features via curricular learning, enabling better performance under limited bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative perception improves reliability and coverage for autonomous vehicles, but transmitting full feature maps over constrained vehicular networks is impractical. Foreground-centric methods discard background context, which still carries informative cues. FadeLead aims to preserve context without transmitting background data by embedding it into foreground representations during training.

Method: Train a foreground-centric network that encapsulates background cues into compact foreground features. Employ a curricular learning strategy: expose the model to background information early in training and progressively prune it, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations that can be shared.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated and real-world benchmarks shows FadeLead outperforms prior foreground-centric methods across various bandwidth settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Conclusion: Context-enriched foreground sharing via curricular learning offers an effective and bandwidth-efficient approach for cooperative perception in autonomous systems, suggesting broader applicability for networked perception tasks.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A selective survey of 4D generation and reconstruction, focusing on 4D representations (geometry, motion, interaction) and guidance on choosing and customizing representations for tasks, with emphasis on NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and under-explored approaches, plus the roles of LLMs/VFMs and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid evolution of 4D generation and reconstruction demands a principled guide that clarifies representation choices, tradeoffs, and workflows across computation, data, and applications, tying together geometry, motion, interaction, and AI models.

Method: A selective, representative review organized around three pillars (geometry, motion, interaction). The authors compare popular and under-explored 4D representations, discuss performance and data requirements under various tasks, integrate insights on LLMs and video foundational models, and survey available datasets, culminating in practical guidance and a project page.

Result: The survey provides a decision-oriented framework to select and customize 4D representations for specific tasks, outlines the strengths and limitations of each approach, identifies current gaps and challenges (notably in data and long-range motion modeling), and maps available datasets to representational choices.

Conclusion: Practitioners can leverage the framework to choose and tailor 4D representations for their tasks, while researchers are alerted to gaps (e.g., structured models, long-range motion, robust LLM/VFM integration) and future directions in 4D data and modeling.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

*Yun Kai Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR method with semantic edge guidance via ControlNet and a hybrid loss to improve structure while preserving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) deals with complex degradations and reconstruction ambiguities. One-step diffusion models are fast but prone to structural inaccuracies due to distillation artifacts. There is a need to improve structural fidelity without sacrificing speed by leveraging edge information.

Method: Incorporates a ControlNet mechanism to inject semantic edge guidance into a one-step diffusion model, enabling dynamic structural control during single-pass inference. Introduces a hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to jointly optimize pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision.

Result: Experiments indicate improved structural integrity and realism while maintaining the efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a better balance between output quality and inference speed. The authors provide test dataset results and plan to publish code on GitHub.

Conclusion: The proposed framework (likely named SCEESR) demonstrates that edge-guided one-step diffusion, together with a hybrid loss, can yield fast yet structurally faithful Real-ISR outputs, offering a favorable trade-off between quality and speed and suggesting avenues for extending conditioning modalities and losses.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

TL;DR: MobiAct is a lightweight MAV action recognition framework that achieves high accuracy with low energy and fast inference by using MobileNetV4, Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation from a ResNet18 teacher, a parameter-free attention module, and a hybrid loss strategy; it delivers 92.12% accuracy with 136.16 pJ energy and 8.84 actions/s, outperforming rivals in speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time MAV action recognition on resource-limited UAVs without sacrificing accuracy, addressing the trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Method: Backbone MobileNetV4; Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) to transfer features from ResNet18 to the student; adds a parameter-free attention mechanism; employs a hybrid loss for stable multi-objective optimization.

Result: On three self-collected datasets, average recognition accuracy 92.12%; energy consumption 136.16 pJ; throughput 8.84 actions per second; decoding speed up to 2x faster than the leading method with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: MobiAct demonstrates that accurate MAV action recognition can be achieved with low energy and computation, achieving the fastest decoding speed among competitors, suitable for real-time MAV swarms.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

### [23] [D2D: Detector-to-Differentiable Critic for Improved Numeracy in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19278)
*Nobline Yoo,Olga Russakovsky,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2D converts non-differentiable object detectors into differentiable critics by designing activation functions to turn detector logits into soft indicators, enabling diffusion models to better count objects during generation with minimal image quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often miscount objects specified by prompts. External counting critics are typically differentiable; non-differentiable detectors offer superior counting via counting-by-enumeration but cannot guide generation. The work aims to bridge this gap by making detectors differentiable.

Method: Introduce a detector-to-differentiable (D2D) framework that uses custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize the diffusion model's noise prior at inference time for improved numeracy. Evaluation spans SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks with varying density and multi-object scenarios.

Result: Consistent and substantial gains in object counting accuracy, e.g., up to 13.7% improvement on D2D-Small (400 prompts, low-density), with minimal degradation in image quality and modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: D2D enables leveraging detector-based counting capabilities to guide numeracy in text-to-image diffusion, expanding the set of viable counting critics while maintaining image quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Method: An ensemble ProtoNet-based approach that integrates various pre-trained CNN encoders as feature extractors; uses a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to refine classification of disease progression stages; evaluated on Kaggle Alzheimer’s dataset and the ADNI dataset.

Result: Achieves 99.72% accuracy on Kaggle and 99.86% on ADNI, surpassing reported state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows strong performance and potential for real-world early Alzheimer’s detection, though further validation across diverse datasets and considerations of generalization, fairness, and privacy are warranted.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

Motivation: To enhance safety, efficiency, and performance across domains by detecting and predicting procedural mistakes from visual data.

Method: Systematic literature review; taxonomy by procedural structure, supervision level, and learning strategy; analysis of datasets, metrics, and state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: Consolidated framework and insights; synthesis of existing work; identification of open challenges (intra-class variability, viewpoint changes, compositional activity structure, error propagation) and future directions.

Conclusion: Vision-based mistake analysis offers strong potential across diverse domains; a unified perspective can guide future research, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state modeling.

Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,
vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as
incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore
the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and
compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning
strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from
true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future
directions, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state
modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based
mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to
enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

### [26] [Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19307)
*Byung-Kwan Lee,Ryo Hachiuma,Yong Man Ro,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Yueh-Hua Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vision-language model training framework, Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), that combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning to enable small VLMs to imitate large teachers and improve via reinforcement signals, using an LLM-based discriminator and multiple teacher models to guide learning, achieving competitive or surpassing results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models deliver strong performance but are impractical for constrained resources. There is a need for efficient training methods that let smaller models closely approach the capabilities of big models by leveraging reinforcement signals and diverse teacher guidance.

Method: RIL integrates reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. It uses an LLM-based discriminator to distinguish student outputs from teacher outputs and leverages multiple large teacher VLMs to provide diverse guidance. The training combines imitation (via the discriminator/adversarial setup) with reinforcement signals to improve generative capabilities of a lightweight student model.

Result: Experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks show that RIL narrows the gap to state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several cases, surpasses them, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified reinforcement and imitation learning for efficient VLMs.

Conclusion: Unified reinforcement and imitation learning offers a practical, effective framework for training compact VLMs that can rival large models, validating the synergy of RL and adversarial imitation with multi-teacher guidance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

### [27] [From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19654)
*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Policy World Model (PWM) unifies world modeling and trajectory planning for driving, leveraging action-free future state forecasting and collaborative state-action prediction to enable anticipatory planning from a single front camera; it uses a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism to improve video forecasting and claims competitive performance with multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are typically built for simulation and decoupled from planning, limiting their usefulness for autonomous planning. A synergistic mechanism that integrates world modeling with planning is needed to improve decision quality and reliability, inspired by human anticipatory perception.

Method: Propose Policy World Model (PWM) architecture that jointly models world dynamics and planning in a unified framework. Key components include action-free future state forecasting, collaborative state-action prediction, and a dynamic parallel token generation module with a context-guided tokenizer and adaptive dynamic focal loss to accelerate video forecasting. The system operates using only front camera input.

Result: PWM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view or multi-modal inputs, despite using only front camera data.

Conclusion: PWM enables more reliable planning through human-like anticipatory perception by leveraging learned world knowledge within a unified planning model and improves video forecasting efficiency; code and weights will be released.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

### [28] [Online Handwritten Signature Verification Based on Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19321)
*Hai-jie Yuan,Heng Zhang,Fei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based, attention-driven dynamic signature verifier (TS-GATR) integrates DGATR and GRU to model spatial-temporal features, achieving lower EER than prior methods on MSDS and DeepSignDB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-user variability and forgery risks in signature verification demand modeling of complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Graph-based representations with attention can capture dynamic relationships among signature features.

Method: Introduce Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR): signatures are represented as graphs with nodes capturing dynamic features (position, velocity, pressure). Uses a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) with k-step (local) and k-NN (global) adjacency graphs to model spatial features. Combines Graph Attention Network (GAT) with GRU to capture long-term temporal dependencies. End-to-end approach evaluated on benchmark datasets.

Result: TS-GATR surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving consistently lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across multiple scenarios on benchmark datasets (MSDS and DeepSignDB).

Conclusion: The proposed TS-GATR effectively models spatial-temporal dynamics for dynamic signature verification; integrating DGATR with GRU yields robust performance gains over prior approaches.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task deep learning framework Seabed-Net jointly predicts bathymetry and seabed classes from remote sensing imagery, outperforming baselines and improving consistency and boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate, updated bathymetry and seabed maps in under-mapped shallow-water regions; separate depth and classification tasks limit accuracy and adoption of deep learning.

Method: Dual-branch encoders for bathymetry and seabed classification, cross-task feature fusion via Attention Feature Fusion module and windowed Swin-Transformer fusion; dynamic task uncertainty weighting; evaluated at two coastal sites; open-source code.

Result: Significant performance gains: up to 75% RMSE reduction over empirical and ML baselines; 10-30% RMSE improvement over single-task and multi-task baselines; seabed classification accuracy up to 8%.

Conclusion: Joint depth and substrate/seabed habitat modeling yields synergistic gains and offers a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

*Juncheng Wang,Lei Shang,Ziqi Liu,Wang Lu,Xixu Hu,Zhe Hu,Jindong Wang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale shift in head scale distribution degrades domain-generalized crowd localization; introduces ScaleBench benchmark, reproduces 20 DG methods, and proposes Catto (Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing) to mitigate shift effects; four key insights and a new research direction: Scale Shift DG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the impact of head scale distribution shifts on crowd localization under domain generalization, a problem insufficiently explored.

Method: Systematically analyze scale shift effects across levels; build ScaleBench benchmark; reproduce 20 existing DG algorithms; provide theoretical analysis; develop Catto; perform extensive experiments to extract insights.

Result: Scale shift significantly affects performance in DG for crowd localization; existing DG methods have limitations under scale shift; Catto improves robustness; four major insights; establishes Scale Shift Domain Generalization as an important research direction.

Conclusion: Scale shift is a critical, under-explored factor in DG for crowd localization. The paper provides benchmark tools and a novel method (Catto), highlighting the necessity of studying Scale Shift DG and outlining directions for future work.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

### [31] [BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332)
*Tian Xia,Zihan Ma,Xinlong Wang,Qing Liu,Xiaowei He,Tianming Liu,Yudan Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  BrainMCLIP is a parameter-efficient, hierarchy-guided multi-layer fusion approach for decoding fMRI to images by aligning activity in low-/high-level visual areas with intermediate and final CLIP layers, achieving strong high-level semantic performance with substantially fewer parameters and without a VAE path.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image decoding often relies on heavy VAE-based pipelines and ignores the brain's functional hierarchy and CLIP's intermediate layers, leading to inefficiency and potentially missed visual details.

Method: BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, avoiding a separate VAE pathway. It introduces a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a multi-granularity loss to fuse information across layers while respecting visual hierarchy.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance, excelling on high-level semantic metrics and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods (including VAE-based approaches) while reducing parameters by about 71.7% by not using a VAE pipeline. It leverages intermediate CLIP features to capture visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches.

Conclusion: A hierarchy-guided, multi-layer fusion approach with cross-reconstruction and multi-granularity loss can achieve strong semantic decoding of fMRI data into images with significantly fewer parameters, effectively balancing semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE path.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

### [32] [A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333)
*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary image segmentation and recognition (OVSR) by combining unsupervised EfficientNetB0-based segmentation with CLIP-based open-vocabulary recognition, using SVD and hierarchical clustering with adaptive cluster counts, achieving state-of-the-art Hungarian mIoU and related metrics on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition without task-specific supervision by leveraging unsupervised segmentation and cross-modal alignment via CLIP; address open-set recognition with an explicit 'something else' prompt and adaptive clustering.

Method: A two-stage pipeline. Stage 1 performs unsupervised segmentation by extracting pixel-wise features from EfficientNetB0, applying singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, and clustering them with hierarchical clustering; the number of clusters is adapted based on the distribution of singular values. Stage 2 encodes each segmented region with CLIP's Vision Transformer, while text embeddings are computed from category prompts (including a generic 'something else' prompt). Image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent space via SVD, and recognition is performed via softmax over cosine similarities in that space.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks (COCO, ADE20K, PASCAL VOC) in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: A training-free OVSR framework that demonstrates effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability by integrating unsupervised segmentation with cross-modal CLIP alignment and adaptive clustering.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

*Kai Shi,Jun Yang,Ni Yang,Binqiang Pan,Qingsong Xie,Chao Zhang,Zhenyu Yang,Tianhuang Su,Haonan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DaMo learns data-mixing strategies to optimize multitask fine-tuning of multimodal LLMs for mobile tasks, achieving strong generalization and consistent gains across domestic benchmarks and a new PhoneAgentBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multitask MLLMs for mobile applications underperform due to poor guidance on composing training data for multiple tasks; existing SFT data selection is ad hoc and task-agnostic, limiting performance.

Method: A trainable network predicts downstream task performance for any dataset ratio, enabling optimization of data mixtures; evaluated with PhoneAgentBench (a multimodal mobile-task QA benchmark) and additional benchmarks (BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, OCRBench); demonstrates predictive accuracy (R^2=0.81) and data-mix optimization.

Result: DaMo yields 3.38% accuracy/score gains on PhoneAgentBench over baselines; averages 2.57% improvement across BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, OCRBench; 12.47% improvement on BFCL-v3 when optimized for MLLMs; maintains performance gains across model architectures.

Conclusion: DaMo effectively optimizes data mixtures for multitask MLLMs on mobile tasks and generalizes beyond the studied models; PhoneAgentBench provides a dedicated evaluation suite; code/dataset released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

*Ahsan Raza Siyal,Markus Haltmeier,Ruth Steiger,Malik Galijasevic,Elke Ruth Gizewski,Astrid Ellen Grams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARE introduces a deformable registration framework with adaptive elastic regularization driven by the gradient norm of the deformation field, incorporating adaptive strain and shear energy terms and a folding-prevention mechanism to maintain anatomical plausibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based deformable registration often lacks robust regularization, risking non-physical deformations; there is a need for dynamic regularization that preserves anatomical plausibility while maintaining flexibility.

Method: DARE dynamically adjusts elastic regularization based on the deformation gradient magnitude, adaptively modulating strain and shear energy terms; it also includes a folding-prevention penalty that discourages negative Jacobians to prevent folding and over-smoothing, aiming for more robust and plausible transformations.

Result: The framework claims higher registration accuracy and improved anatomical plausibility compared with baselines by balancing stability and flexibility through adaptive regularization and folding prevention.

Conclusion: Adaptive elastic regularization with folding prevention yields robust, physically plausible deformable registrations, mitigating artifacts like folding while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

### [35] [AegisRF: Adversarial Perturbations Guided with Sensitivity for Protecting Intellectual Property of Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19371)
*Woo Jae Kim,Kyu Beom Han,Yoonki Cho,Youngju Na,Junsik Jung,Sooel Son,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AegisRF introduces a learnable Perturbation Field and a Sensitivity Field to protect NeRFs by injecting adversarial signals into pre-render outputs, enabling effective unauthorized-use disruption while preserving rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect neural radiance field (NeRF) intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized use. Geometric perturbations can ruin scene structure; prior methods either avoided geometry or required meshes. A need exists for adaptive, non-geometric perturbations that safeguard IP without compromising rendering fidelity.

Method: Propose AegisRF with two components: (1) Perturbation Field that injects adversarial perturbations into the NeRF’s pre-render outputs (color and volume density) to fool downstream unauthorized models, and (2) Sensitivity Field that learns spatially varying sensitivity to constrain perturbations, preserving visual quality. The two fields are jointly optimized to maximize disruption of unauthorized use while minimizing rendering degradation, and the framework is evaluated across diverse downstream tasks and modalities.

Result: Experiments show the framework generalizes across tasks such as multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, with high visual fidelity preserved. Code is released at the project page.

Conclusion: AegisRF provides a robust, adaptable IP-protection mechanism for NeRFs by leveraging adaptive, geometry-preserving perturbations that degrade unauthorized downstream use, with broad applicability and potential extension to other 3D representations.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench benchmarks multi-view spatial reasoning in VLMs for robotic manipulation; current models lag behind humans; shows correlation between spatial understanding and execution; single-view benchmarks don't predict multi-view robotic performance; provides dataset and protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating VLMs when using multi-view inputs in embodied robotics and VLA systems. Multi-camera setups help mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity, but there is a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess multi-view reasoning in robotic tasks.

Method: Introduce MV-RoboBench with 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, split into two categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. Evaluate a diverse set of VLMs (open-source and closed-source) and enhanced versions using CoT-inspired techniques, with a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art models remain far below human performance. Spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view scenarios. Strong performance on single-view spatial benchmarks does not reliably translate to the robotic spatial tasks in MV-RoboBench.

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench is released as an open resource with data and a standardized evaluation protocol to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Track workers in a logistics warehouse using 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras; align coordinates via floor-based calibration to mitigate edge distortion, achieving >20% improvement in tracking accuracy and evaluating appearance-feature methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate, real-time worker localization for digital twins and warehouse optimization; single-camera FOV limitations necessitate multi-camera sensing and robust cross-camera fusion.

Method: Deploy 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras; perform floor-based alignment to map image coordinates to warehouse space; mitigate edge distortion by aligning detected foot positions; compare multiple appearance-feature fusion methods for tracking.

Result: Cross-camera alignment based on foot positions reduces distortion effects and yields over 20% improvement in tracking accuracy; appearance-feature approaches variance explored and effective in the proposed framework.

Conclusion: Foot-based floor alignment effectively handles wide-angle distortion; multi-camera setup improves tracking accuracy; appearance-feature methods contribute to robustness in cross-camera tracking.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICK is a multi-step framework that analyzes psychoanalytic drawings (HTP) using hierarchical decomposition and knowledge injection into multimodal LLMs to generate psychological profiles, validated on emotion understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Multimodal LLMs to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains by enabling expert-aligned psychoanalytic interpretation of visual drawings (HTP), bridging AI with clinical psychology.

Method: Decompose drawings into sub-drawings across three hierarchical levels (single-object, multi-object, whole). Analyze sub-drawings at each level with targeted focus to extract psychological insights. Introduce an HTP knowledge base and a feature-extraction module trained with reinforcement learning to generate a psychological profile for single-object level analysis, capturing holistic stylistic features and dynamic object-specific features (house, tree, person). Integrate multi-faceted information to produce an expert-aligned assessment; generalize to emotion understanding tasks.

Result: Experimental results show that PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' capability in psychological analysis and generalizes to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: PICK provides a structured, interpretable bridge between MLLMs and expert psychoanalytic domains, enabling nuanced mental-state assessment from visual expression.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

### [39] [Exploring "Many in Few" and "Few in Many" Properties in Long-Tailed, Highly-Imbalanced IC Defect Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19463)
*Hao-Chiang Shao,Chun-Hao Chang,Yu-Hsien Lin,Chia-Wen Lin,Shao-Yun Fang,Yan-Hsiu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces IC-Defect-14, a real-world, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset with intra-class clusters; presents ReCAME-Net, a multi-expert classifier with regional channel attention, metric learning, hard category mining, and knowledge distillation, achieving SOTA on IC-Defect-14 and competitive results on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces extreme data skew, larger intra-class diversity, and high inter-class similarity, which are not captured by public imbalanced datasets. There is a need for a realistic dataset and methods that can handle mixed class-specific and domain-related features in highly imbalanced settings.

Method: Proposes ReCAME-Net, a multi-expert classifier framework. Key components include a regional channel attention module to capture localized defect cues, metric learning losses to tighten intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class margins, a hard category mining strategy to focus on challenging classes, and a knowledge distillation procedure to integrate knowledge across experts.

Result: Empirical evaluations show ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on IC-Defect-14 and maintains competitive performance on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The IC-Defect-14 dataset coupled with the ReCAME-Net framework provides a practical approach for real-world highly imbalanced IC defect classification, yielding superior performance on realistic data while remaining competitive on public benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

*Ali Sadeghkhani,Brandon Bennett,Masoud Babaei,Arash Rabbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN generates pore-scale images conditioned on porosity and depth to produce representative, site-specific morphology, outperforming random sub-image extraction in representativeness and enabling digital rock physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome non-representativeness of extracted sub-images due to natural heterogeneity and scarce data; need controllable, representative pore microstructures for subsurface applications.

Method: Train a single multi-conditional GAN conditioned on porosity and depth, using thin-section carbonate samples across four depths; the model learns universal pore-network rules plus depth-specific textures; validate against pore metrics.

Result: Achieves porosity control with R^2 = 0.95 and MAE ~0.01–0.02; preserves average pore radius, surface area, and tortuosity; dual-constraint errors for generated vs target images 1.9–11.3%, far improving over 36.4–578% for random sub-images.

Conclusion: This framework provides a transformative tool for subsurface characterization and digital rock physics with broad applications (carbon storage, geothermal, groundwater) by producing representative pore morphologies under controlled properties.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

*Juhyung Park,Rokgi Hong,Roh-Eul Yoo,Jaehyeon Koo,Se Young Chun,Seung Hong Choi,Jongho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A predictive-imaging framework for MRI that uses a generative model to predict a target contrast image, which serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly undersampled data, shifting MRI reconstruction toward predictive imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's long acquisition times limit clinical throughput; existing reconstruction methods underutilize potential priors; leveraging cross-contrast, historical scans, and acquisition metadata can accelerate imaging.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) generate a target-contrast image conditioned on diverse data sources (other contrasts, prior scans, acquisition parameters, patient info) using a generative model; (2) use the predicted image as a prior to reconstruct undersampled k-space data; validate on FLAIR from T1w/T2w and T1w from prior T1w; evaluate on large multi-dataset, multi-channel data, with acceleration x4, x8, x12.

Result: Prediction-prior reconstruction significantly outperforms baselines, including methods with alternative or no priors, across datasets and high accelerations.

Conclusion: This work shifts MRI reconstruction toward a predictive imaging paradigm, leveraging data-driven priors to enable faster, higher-quality imaging.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

### [42] [PRGCN: A Graph Memory Network for Cross-Sequence Pattern Reuse in 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19475)
*Zhuoyang Xie,Yibo Zhao,Hui Huang,Riwei Wang,Zan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular 3D pose estimation benefits from cross-sequence pattern reuse via a memory-augmented graph network (PRGCN) that retrieves pose prototypes to guide 3D lifting, combining Mamba-based state-space modeling with self-attention; achieves state-of-the-art MPJPE on Human3.6M (37.1mm) and MPI-INF-3DHP (13.4mm) and improves cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the ill-posed nature of monocular 3D pose estimation and the limitation of single-sequence processing by leveraging cross-sequence regularities and repetitive motion patterns through a memory bank of pose prototypes and retrieval-based priors.

Method: Memory-augmented graph convolutional network with a graph memory bank of pose prototypes encoded as relational graphs; attention-based retrieval of prototypes; memory-driven graph convolution fused with anatomical constraints; dual-stream architecture combining local temporal Mamba-state-space modeling and global self-attention.

Result: State-of-the-art MPJPE on Human3.6M (37.1mm) and MPI-INF-3DHP (13.4mm); improved cross-domain generalization; robust performance across sequences.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is a pivotal mechanism for enhancing monocular 3D pose estimation, suggesting a shift from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Debias methane plume detection from MNAR cloud cover via imputation and coverage-balanced resampling to reduce bias and improve detection in low-coverage images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MNAR missing pixels due to clouds create a spurious link between image coverage and label, biasing feature extraction and plume detection.

Method: Evaluate multiple imputation approaches to break the coverage-label dependence; introduce a weighted resampling scheme that enforces class balance within coverage bins during training.

Result: Both imputation and resampling reduce representation bias without degrading balanced accuracy, precision, or recall; debiased models better detect plumes in low-coverage images in operational scenarios.

Conclusion: Imputation and coverage-aware resampling effectively mitigate representation bias from MNAR cloud data in satellite plume detection, improving performance where coverage is low.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) tackles SDGOD by removing reliance on spurious cues via cross-attention prompts and a dual-branch adapter, achieving substantial gains and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In SDGOD, domain shift and limited domain-specific knowledge cause models to rely on spurious correlations (e.g., color cues) rather than domain-invariant cues like object contours. There is a need to broaden domain knowledge coverage and disentangle causal features from spurious ones.

Method: Cauvis introduces a Cross-Attention Prompts module that integrates visual prompts with cross-attention to mitigate bias from spurious features. It also deploys a dual-branch adapter to disentangle causal and spurious features and enable domain adaptation through high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9–31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets and shows robust performance in complex interference environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively reduces spurious correlations in SDGOD, leveraging causal prompts and a dual-branch adapter to improve generalization to unseen domains.”

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Moshe Kimhi,Nimrod Shabtay,Raja Giryes,Chaim Baskin,Eli Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight, context-aware preprocessor that predicts the minimal input resolution needed for a target vision-language model, achieving up to 80% compute reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image processing in large vision-language models incurs heavy compute costs. There is a need for adaptive, input-aware resolution to save compute without sacrificing accuracy across multimodal tasks.

Method: CARES uses a compact 350M vision-language model to extract features from an image-query pair and determines when the target VLM’s response has converged to peak accuracy. It is trained as a discrete classifier over a set of candidate resolutions but supports continuous resolution at inference via interpolation.

Result: Empirically, CARES preserves task performance across five multimodal benchmarks (documents and natural images) and multiple target VLMs, while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: A context-aware resolution selector can dramatically cut compute for multimodal inference without harming accuracy, by dynamically choosing the minimal sufficient input resolution per image-query pair.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

### [46] [PoseCrafter: Extreme Pose Estimation with Hybrid Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19527)
*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter introduces Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) and a Feature Matching Selector (FMS) to improve pairwise camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping image pairs by generating clearer intermediate frames and selecting frames most informative for pose estimation; demonstrates notable gains over SOTA on multiple datasets, especially with small or no overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise camera pose estimation is challenging when image pairs have little or no overlap. Video-based interpolation can produce intermediate views but often yields blur with sparse inputs and selection strategies are slow and not well aligned to pose estimation. There is a need for a method that both sharpens intermediate frames and directly optimizes frame selection for pose estimation.

Method: Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) couples a video interpolation model with a pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model to generate clearer intermediate frames. A Feature Matching Selector (FMS) uses feature correspondences to select intermediate frames from the synthesized results that are most informative for pose estimation, enabling PoseCrafter to produce better pose estimates from sparse overlaps.

Result: Extensive experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI show that PoseCrafter yields obvious improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly for examples with small or no image overlap.

Conclusion: The combination of HVG and FMS enables more accurate and robust pairwise pose estimation in challenging overlap scenarios, advancing the practical applicability of pose estimation in 3D vision tasks where image overlap is limited.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with counting and relational reasoning due to a mismatch between last-layer representations and outputs; targeted training of the output layer yields substantial gains (up to ~21%), with consistent improvements on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify the root causes of visual reasoning failures in VLMs and develop a targeted intervention to enhance reasoning, particularly counting, by addressing the mapping into the output space.

Method: Evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs on controlled counting tasks, manipulating object count/type, spatial arrangements, and distractor co-occurrence; perform layer-wise analysis to locate failure sources; fine-tune only the last-layer/output mapping; validate on real-world datasets.

Result: VLMs are highly sensitive to object quantity/type, spatial layout, and distractors. Errors largely arise from incorrect last-layer mapping to the output space. Fine-tuning only the output layer improves counting accuracy by up to 21% and yields consistent gains on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Targeted fine-tuning of the output layer effectively mitigates counting/reasoning errors in VLMs, revealing that the output-space mapping is a key bottleneck and offering a practical, minimal-training approach to enhance visual reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [48] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how prompt complexity affects the utility of synthetic data from text-to-image models, introducing an evaluation framework to compare synthetic vs real data and showing that higher prompt complexity reduces diversity and consistency but lowers the synthetic-real distribution gap; among inference-time interventions, prompt expansion with a language-model likelihood estimator yields the best gains in diversity and aesthetics, sometimes exceeding real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how prompt design and inference-time interventions shape the quality, diversity, consistency, and distribution alignment of synthetic data from T2I models, addressing gaps left by prior work that treats prompts as a straightforward interface and rarely benchmark generalization across prompt complexity.

Method: 1) Synthetic experiments with theoretical derivations to explain generalization difficulty with respect to prompt complexity. 2) Propose a new evaluation framework to compare synthetic vs real data utility. 3) Large-scale empirical study across CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI. 4) Evaluate various inference-time interventions. 5) Analyze effects on conditional diversity, prompt consistency, and distribution shift; compare against real data.

Result: Findings include: higher prompt complexity lowers conditional diversity and prompt consistency but reduces the synthetic-to-real distribution shift (i.e., aligns more with real data). Inference-time interventions can increase diversity at the cost of expanding beyond real data support. Among interventions, prompt expansion using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood estimator achieves the best improvements in image diversity and aesthetics, even surpassing real data in some metrics.

Conclusion: Prompt complexity has trade-offs for T2I synthetic data utility; richer prompts can improve distribution alignment but may hurt diversity and consistency. Prompt-expansion-based interventions are particularly effective for boosting diversity and aesthetics. The proposed framework enables robust comparison between synthetic and real data across datasets and prompts, guiding practical design of synthetic data pipelines.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TIME10k to study temporal awareness in large vision-language models; discovers a low-dimensional nonlinear time manifold in VLM embeddings; derives explicit timeline representations from the embedding space; shows competitive-to-superior accuracy versus a prompt-based baseline and higher efficiency; releases code and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether vision-language models can locate visual content in time and to enable temporal reasoning by extracting an explicit timeline from their embedding spaces, addressing a gap in how VLMs handle temporal information.

Method: Introduce TIME10k, a dataset of >10k images with temporal ground truth. Evaluate 37 VLMs using a novel methodology to probe time-awareness. Analyze embedding spaces to reveal a low-dimensional, nonlinear time manifold. Propose methods to extract explicit timeline representations from embeddings that model time and chronological progression. Compare timeline methods to a prompt-based baseline, finding competitive-to-superior performance with improved efficiency.

Result: Temporal information in VLM embeddings forms a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Explicit timeline representations derived from embeddings can model time and chronology and perform well, often outperforming prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that explicit timeline extraction from VLM embeddings enables effective temporal reasoning, providing a practical pathway for time-aware multimodal understanding. Code and data availability facilitates replication and further research.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

### [50] [HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560)
*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) for RGB-event tracking addresses spatio-temporal asymmetry through hierarchical alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient, compact distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB cameras offer rich textures and high spatial resolution while event cameras provide superior temporal resolution and HDR. Their complementary strengths can substantially improve tracking under challenging conditions, but fundamental imaging differences create spatio-temporal asymmetries that impede effective fusion.

Method: Introduce HAD, a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework with hierarchical alignment that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries, aiming to minimize information loss while preserving computational efficiency and parameter compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments show HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods; comprehensive ablations validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component; code will be released soon.

Conclusion: HAD effectively models and mitigates cross-modal asymmetries in RGB-event tracking, enabling robust, efficient multi-modal fusion and showcasing a practical distillation approach with broad applicability.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

### [51] [Can You Trust What You See? Alpha Channel No-Box Attacks on Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19574)
*Ariana Yi,Ce Zhou,Liyang Xiao,Qiben Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: No-box adversarial attack on video detectors using the alpha channel of RGBA videos (alpha-Cloak); fuses malicious content into benign video with no perceptual artifacts, achieving 100% success across multiple detectors and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based perception systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, surveillance) are vulnerable to adversarial inputs. The alpha channel represents an unexplored attack surface that can bypass human oversight while fooling detectors; studying this threat informs defense design.

Method: Investigate alpha-channel support across formats; design a fusion algorithm to embed a malicious video into a benign RGBA video through the alpha channel without perceptible artifacts; ensure no access to model architecture, parameters, or outputs (no-box setting); evaluate on five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multimodal LLM (Gemini-2.0-Flash).

Result: The attack achieves a 100% success rate across all tested scenarios, with the fused videos remaining visually innocuous to humans and requiring no model access or artifacting detectable by observers.

Conclusion: Alpha-channel exploitation reveals a new vulnerability in video-based perception systems. Defenses must account for alpha-channel manipulation in adversarial robustness, and video pipelines should monitor alpha-channel consistency and integrity to mitigate such no-box attacks.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

*Junhong Lin,Kangli Wang,Shunzhou Wang,Songlin Fan,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD) is a feed-forward, end-to-end framework that learns explicit geometric priors and uses a Gaussian-head to render high-fidelity surround-view scenes, outperforming SOTA on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surround-view setup with minimal overlap challenges geometric consistency and novel-view quality; improving generalization requires explicitly learned geometry to guide semantic refinement.

Method: A lightweight VGGT-inspired geometry branch distilled from a pre-trained VGGT for geometric priors; a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel-view rendering (sharing patch backbone); multi-scale features from geometry and Gaussian head used to supervise a semantic refinement model in a feature-consistent learning framework.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art on nuScenes in both objective metrics and subjective quality across settings; demonstrates scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Conclusion: Explicit geometric priors and feature-consistent semantic refinement enable robust, high-quality surround-view reconstruction in fast, generalizable feed-forward inference.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

### [53] [Multi-modal Co-learning for Earth Observation: Enhancing single-modality models via modality collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19579)
*Francisco Mena,Dino Ienco,Cassio F. Dantas,Roberto Interdonato,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalizable multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that enables strong single-modality inference by leveraging training-time multi-modal data, via joint contrastive and modality-discriminative objectives, and shows improvements across multiple EO tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth Observation data are abundant across multiple modalities during training, but inference often has access to only a subset of modalities due to real-world constraints. A modality-agnostic co-learning strategy can transfer rich training information to improve single-modality predictions across diverse EO tasks.

Method: Proposes a framework that jointly optimizes contrastive learning and modality-discriminative learning to shape the model's internal representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components, enabling generalization across tasks and modalities. Evaluated on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression with single-modality inference.

Result: The approach yields consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods from recent ML and CV literature as well as EO-specific baselines across the evaluated tasks, demonstrating robust gains in single-modality inference.

Conclusion: The framework offers a versatile, task- and modality-agnostic approach to multi-modal co-learning in EO, enabling more effective single-modality deployment when only limited modalities are available at inference time.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

TL;DR: Introduces VAEEDOF, a distilled variational autoencoder-based MFIF framework that fuses up to seven focused images into a single high-fidelity image, and MattingMFIF, a synthetic 4K dataset for realistic depth-of-field effects; achieves state-of-the-art, artifact-free fusion and bridges synthetic to real data; code and weights released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DOF limitations of optics, scarcity of labeled MFIF data, domain gaps from synthetic datasets, and regions lacking information hinder performance; aims to enable robust, high-quality fusion across multiple focus points and realistic training data.

Method: A distilled variational autoencoder for high-fidelity reconstruction; a fusion module that can process up to seven source images simultaneously; introduction of MattingMFIF—synthetic 4K dataset simulating realistic DOF effects from real photographs—to train and evaluate the approach.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with seamless, artifact-free fused images; robust across diverse focus configurations; narrows the gap between synthetic training data and real-world images.

Conclusion: Represents a significant advancement in MFIF by delivering a scalable fusion framework and a realistic synthetic dataset; code and model weights are provided to facilitate adoption and further research.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarks uncertainty estimation methods for per-pixel semantic segmentation in satellite imagery, evaluating models like Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles on two EO datasets (PASTIS, ForTy) to assess practical utility in identifying errors and noise, with practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimates are crucial for reliable semantic segmentation in remote sensing. Unlike standard image classification, per-pixel uncertainties and scalable approaches are needed. There's a gap in EO-specific benchmarking, with most prior work on medical imaging or general scene understanding.

Method: A benchmarking study evaluating various uncertainty estimation methods (including Stochastic Segmentation Networks, ensembles) across multiple architectures and uncertainty metrics on two EO datasets (PASTIS, ForTy), focusing on practical utility to detect errors and noisy regions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation with practical recommendations. The results identify how different methods and metrics perform in EO segmentation, guiding practitioners on which combinations to use, though specifics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper provides a systematic, EO-focused benchmark of uncertainty estimation for semantic segmentation and offers actionable guidance for deploying uncertainty-aware segmentation in EO applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated modular framework converts scanned or photographed ECGs into clean digital signals, validated on large datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art, with open-source release to unlock retrospective archives and enable AI diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many ECG records exist only as paper scans; digitizing them enables modern diagnostics, large-scale research, reproducibility, and democratizes access to AI-driven cardiac tools.

Method: A modular, automated pipeline processes scanned images with artifacts (perspective distortion, wrinkles, stains) to extract digital ECG signals. Validated on 37,191 ECG images from Akershus University Hospital (1,596 collected on-site) and on the Emory Paper Digitization ECG Dataset (35,595 images). Achieved a mean SNR of 19.65 dB on artifact-laden scans and reported improvements over state-of-the-art across all subcategories.

Result: Demonstrated high-quality digital ECG signal extraction from large-scale paper-image datasets; outperformed prior methods on the Emory dataset; released full software as open-source to promote reproducibility and further development.

Conclusion: The framework enables reproducible digitization of paper ECG archives and broadens access to AI-driven diagnostics by converting legacy records into usable digital signals.

Abstract: Millions of clinical ECGs exist only as paper scans, making them unusable for
modern automated diagnostics. We introduce a fully automated, modular framework
that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for
both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191
ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the
algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers
with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization
ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective
distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in
all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting
reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute
to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven
diagnostics.

### [57] [Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592)
*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method (DecAF) refines attention maps from multimodal LLMs for video localization, converting them into coarse segmentation masks and then using attention-guided prompting to obtain fine masks, achieving competitive results with trained methods on referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate video localization with multimodal LLMs without retraining, addressing the noise and misalignment of raw attention maps and the lack of training-free segmentation tools.

Method: DecAF refines rollout-derived attention maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background fusion to suppress background activations, and (2) complementary video-frame fusion to leverage cross-frame cues. The refined maps yield coarse segmentation masks that can be converted directly. Additionally, attention-guided SAM2 prompting is used to obtain fine-grained masks. The approach requires no retraining of MLLMs or SAM models.

Result: DecAF outperforms existing training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on referring and reasoning video object segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Training-free video segmentation from MLLMs is feasible via decomposition of attention signals and cross-frame fusion, with a two-stage approach (coarse via DecAF plus fine masks via SAM2 prompting) enabling competitive performance without retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

### [58] [CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597)
*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a conditional Bernoulli diffusion framework for image forgery localization that outputs multiple plausible localization maps, uses Bernoulli noise and Time-Step Cross-Attention, and outperforms state-of-the-art on 8 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single deterministic localization maps in IFL may misrepresent uncertainty in tampered regions, which is risky for high-stakes forensic analysis. A probabilistic, diverse set of plausible maps can enhance credibility and decision-making.

Method: A conditional diffusion model (CBDiff) that generates multiple diverse forgery masks by incorporating Bernoulli noise to reflect binary sparse masks. It introduces Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention) to leverage semantic guidance across diffusion steps, improving manipulation detection and producing plausible, diverse localization maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets show CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating stronger accuracy and diversity of localization maps and robustness across datasets.

Conclusion: CBDiff provides an uncertainty-aware, credible IFL framework with strong potential for real-world deployment in forensic analysis and security surveillance.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic benchmark reveals cross-modal grounding in chest X-ray VLMs is limited, especially for small/diffuse lesions; domain-specific pretraining improves alignment; recognition and grounding are correlated; underscores need for interpretable benchmarks before clinical deployment (XBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinically reliable grounding is essential for interpretability and adoption; current VLMs show strong recognition but uncertain alignment between text and visual evidence; lack of standardized interpretability benchmarks in medical imaging.

Method: Evaluate seven CLIP-style VLM variants on chest X-ray tasks; generate visual explanations via cross-attention and similarity-based localization; quantitatively assess alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies.

Result: Localization is reasonable for large, well-defined pathologies; performance degrades for small or diffuse lesions; models pretrained on chest X-ray data show improved alignment over general-domain pretraining; recognition ability and grounding ability are strongly correlated.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit strong recognition but limited clinically reliable grounding; targeted interpretability benchmarks are needed before clinical deployment; XBench code is available at the provided URL.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [60] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A denoising estimator based on joint l1-norm minimisation/maximisation of scattering coefficients; numerically suggests minimax-optimal denoising for cartoon images across all Lipschitz exponents α≤2; links harmonic analysis with CNN-inspired denoising and opens a bridge to deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse estimators in frames are not rich enough to adapt to complex signal regularities, especially for cartoon-like images with unknown α. Wavelet scattering provides a CNN-like framework with a mathematically tractable structure. The work aims to leverage l1-norm geometry of scattering coefficients to improve denoising and to connect harmonic analysis with deep learning-based denoising.

Method: Introduce a denoising estimator that jointly minimizes and maximizes the l1 norms of different subsets of wavelet scattering coefficients. Prove that these distinct l1 norms capture different types of geometric image regularity. Validate the approach with numerical experiments demonstrating minimax performance for cartoon images across α≤2, and articulate the results as a mathematical conjecture.

Result: Analytical result: the proposed l1-norm structures capture different geometric regularities in images. Empirical result: the denoising estimator attains the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images with Lipschitz exponent α≤2 in numerical experiments; the optimality claim is stated as a conjecture based on these results.

Conclusion: The approach offers a novel harmonic-analysis-based denoising method that complements deep CNN-based denoisers, clarifies how scattering coefficients encode geometry, and creates a theoretical–empirical bridge between harmonic analysis and data-driven denoising.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

### [61] [Pragmatic Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception via Generative Communication Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19618)
*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm enables practical heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration by generating cross-agent features instead of sharing intermediate representations, using a deformable extractor and a conditional diffusion generator to align spatial-aware features with the ego space, plus a Channel Enhancer for refinement; supports scalable onboarding of new agents with minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous agents have sensor/model gaps causing domain shifts during collaboration. Intrusive retraining and high onboarding costs prevent scalable, pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration.

Method: Introduce a Deformable Message Extractor to obtain spatial messages per collaborator; a Spatial-Aware Feature Generator (conditional diffusion model) to produce ego-space-aligned features that preserve collaborators' spatial information; a Channel Enhancer refines features before fusion; lightweight spatial alignment enables adding new agents with minimal cost; no retraining of core networks.

Result: GenComm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X, and V2X-Real. It achieves an 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

Conclusion: GenComm provides a scalable, efficient framework for heterogeneous multi-agent perception that preserves semantic consistency without retraining, enabling easy onboarding of new agents while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our

*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR (Augmented Moment Retrieval) is a zero-external-dependency framework addressing data scarcity, boundary ambiguity, and fine-grained semantic discrimination in moment retrieval. It uses augmented data without new labels and a two-stage training (cold-start with curriculum, then distillation) featuring Original and Active Queries with cross-stage consistency, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>

Motivation: Three bottlenecks hinder current Moment Retrieval: (1) data scarcity leads to shallow keyword-feature associations, (2) boundary ambiguity between adjacent events, (3) insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., kicking vs throwing).

Method: AMR leverages zero-external-dependency data augmentation to resolve boundary/semantic confusion without additional labeling. It employs a two-stage training: (a) cold-start with curriculum learning on augmented data to establish boundary/semantic awareness, and (b) distillation adaptation with dual query sets. In the distillation stage, Original Queries perform DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model, while Active Queries adapt to real-data distributions; a cross-stage distillation loss aligns Original and Base Queries to prevent forgetting and improve generalization.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AMR effectively mitigates annotation bottlenecks and enhances boundary and semantic discrimination without extra labeling, while its two-stage training preserves learned awareness and generalizes to real-world data.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

*Yifan Li,Fenghe Tang,Yingtai Li,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedReason-R1: a medical Vision-Language Model with explicit diagnostic reasoning, enhanced by ROI-zoomed disease regions and trained on CT-RATE-VQA (84K QA pairs) using GRPO reinforcement learning; achieves state-of-the-art CT disease diagnosis while preserving generalization; code and data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two major gaps in medical VLMs: lack of large-scale, high-quality specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process that goes from coarse to fine-grained. The work aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and reasoning efficiency in CT disease diagnosis by providing a dedicated dataset and a reasoning-enabled medical VLM.

Method: 1) Construct CT-RATE-VQA dataset with 84k QA pairs. 2) Propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM that embeds zoom-in disease ROI areas into the image to emphasize both global localization and disease-specific details. 3) Introduce GRPO reinforcement learning to MedReason-R1 to enable effective reasoning without costly manual annotations.

Result: MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis compared to recent general-purpose and medical VLMs, while maintaining generalization. The approach reduces reliance on manual annotations via GRPO. Code, checkpoints, and dataset are released.

Conclusion: A dataset-centered and reasoning-focused approach (CT-RATE-VQA + MedReason-R1 + GRPO) can substantially enhance CT disease diagnosis with medical VLMs and maintain generalization, suggesting a promising direction for medical VLM development.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,
checkpoints, and dataset are available at:

### [64] [Re-Activating Frozen Primitives for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19653)
*Yuxin Cheng,Binxiao Huang,Wenyong Zhou,Taiqiang Wu,Zhengwu Liu,Graziano Chesi,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS introduces a re-activation mechanism for 3D Gaussian Splatting to fix over-reconstruction artifacts by reactivating densification in complex regions and escaping frozen primitives, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis performance and generalizing to other variants like Pixel-GS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) delivers real-time photorealistic novel view synthesis but suffers in complex scenes due to artifacts from over-reconstruction. The paper identifies two fundamental issues — gradient magnitude dilution during densification and a primitive frozen phenomenon — that hinder performance and geometric fidelity.

Method: Propose ReAct-GS with two components: (1) an importance-aware densification criterion that uses alpha-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to re-activate stalled growth in complex regions; (2) a re-activation mechanism that revives frozen primitives via adaptive parameter perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ReAct-GS eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts, achieves state-of-the-art results on standard novel view synthesis metrics, and preserves detailed geometry. The re-activation mechanism also improves other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, indicating broad applicability.

Conclusion: ReAct-GS effectively mitigates over-reconstruction in 3D-GS, delivering superior NVS performance while maintaining geometric detail, and generalizes well to other Gaussian-splatting variants.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*John Burden,Jonathan Prunty,Ben Slater,Matthieu Tehenan,Greg Davis,Lucy Cheke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs show human-like visual search behavior—pop-out for color/size and capacity limits for multi-feature search—and use scene priors (like lighting) in object representations; study uses cognitive-psychology paradigms, fine-tuning, and interpretability analyses as a diagnostic tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond task accuracy and understand perceptual mechanisms in multimodal LLMs by adapting classic visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology to quantify perceptual capabilities and priors.

Method: Adapt visual search paradigms to MLLMs with controlled experiments targeting color, size, and lighting; compare single-feature (disjunctive) search vs. conjunctive search; use targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses to reinforce findings.

Result: Advanced MLLMs exhibit human-like pop-out effects in color/size for single-feature search and show capacity limits in conjunctive search; evidence that MLLMs incorporate natural scene priors (e.g., lighting direction) into object representations; findings supported by targeted fine-tuning and interpretability analyses.

Conclusion: Visual search paradigms provide a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool to evaluate perceptual capabilities of MLLMs; results suggest human-like perceptual properties and bounds, advocating for cognitive benchmarks in model evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

### [66] [Curvilinear Structure-preserving Unpaired Cross-domain Medical Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19679)
*Zihao Chen,Yi Zhou,Xudong Jiang,Li Chen,Leopold Schmetterer,Bingyao Tan,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unpaired medical image translation often breaks fine curvilinear structures (e.g., microvasculature). CST adds a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision to preserve geometry during translation, integrated into CycleGAN and UNSB, and validated across OCTA, color fundus, and X-ray angiography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserve delicate curvilinear microstructures in unpaired cross-domain medical image translation to maintain diagnostic reliability and enable quantitative analysis, which existing methods often distort.

Method: Introduce Curvilinear Structure-preserving Translation (CST) with a curvilinear extraction module that enforces structure consistency. CST can be plugged into existing unpaired translation backbones (demonstrated with CycleGAN and UNSB) and uses topological supervision to preserve fine vascular structures during translation.

Result: Evaluation on three modalities—optical coherence tomography angiography, color fundus, and X-ray coronary angiography—shows CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance by preserving curvilinear structures.

Conclusion: Reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings yields curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging, offering a principled framework for reliable unpaired image-to-image translation.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ensemble-CAM to provide visual explanations for deep learning-based face presentation attack detectors, aiming to improve transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based PAD models are effective but opaque; visual explanations can help users understand predictions and identify key regions that drive real/vs-fake decisions.

Method: Introduce Ensemble-CAM, a visual explanation technique for DL face PAD systems that aggregates multiple activation maps to highlight important regions contributing to a classification.

Result: Produces visual explanations that reveal which regions influence real vs. fake decisions, enhancing interpretability, transparency, and potential trust in DL-based PAD systems.

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM improves the interpretability of DL-based face PAD, contributing to more transparent and trustworthy security systems.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework that learns robust, interpretable latent dynamics from high-dimensional video by combining a spatio-temporal TimeSformer autoencoder with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer and a phase-2 dimension selection via correlation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extract true dynamical variables from videos cluttered by background motion, occlusions, and texture changes; achieve accurate long-horizon predictions and physical interpretability.

Method: Phase 1 uses a TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions and suppress nuisance variation, enabling distraction-robust latent learning and accurate long-horizon video prediction. Phase 2 selects physically meaningful latent dimensions using linear correlation analysis and applies a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs.

Result: Across five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including chaotic phenomena, LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic-dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and yields the lowest analytical mean squared error among CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are both accurate and physically interpretable; LyTimeT advances state-of-the-art in unsupervised discovery of dynamical variables from video.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

### [69] [Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization for Mixed-Precision Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19760)
*Shaohang Jia,Zhiyong Huang,Zhi Yu,Mingyang Hou,Shuai Miao,Han Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) is a mixed-precision QAT framework that addresses non-uniform activations and static weight codebooks via an adaptive, quantile-informed weight quantization, EMA-based codebook updates, and a sensitivity-aware allocation, plus a non-uniform-to-uniform activation mapping. It achieves strong ImageNet results (ResNet-18, 71.512% Top-1 with 2.81-bit average) and is validated by CIFAR-10 ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two major challenges in quantized networks: (i) highly non-uniform activation distributions that hamper uniform quantization, and (ii) static, mismatched codebooks for weight quantization that fail to track distributional shifts during training and deployment.

Method: ADQ comprises: (1) quantile-based initialization to align the initial weight codebook with the weight distribution; (2) online codebook adaptation via Exponential Moving Average to track distributional changes; (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for allocating mixed-precision across layers/weights; and for activations, a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping to ease implementation.

Result: Empirical validation on ImageNet shows ResNet-18 achieving 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an average bit-width of 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under comparable settings. CIFAR-10 ablations demonstrate the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: The proposed ADQ framework effectively tackles non-uniform activations and dynamic weight distributions through adaptive, quantile-aligned initialization, EMA-based codebook updates, and sensitivity-aware precision allocation, combined with practical activation mapping, yielding strong accuracy with low average bit-width.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X is a unified multimodal motion-generation framework using an autoregressive diffusion transformer, achieving state-of-the-art across text/music/speech-to-motion and long-duration tasks by conditioning on reference motion and a mixed-condition training strategy, trained on the large OmniMoCap-X dataset with GPT-4o captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in multimodal human motion generation and enable coherent, long-duration, cross-modal synthesis with flexible conditioning signals.

Method: Autoregressive diffusion transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence framework; multimodal conditioning signals (text, music, speech, and reference motion); progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training; OmniMoCap-X assembled from 28 MoCap sources across 10 tasks (SMPL-X, 30 fps); video rendering with GPT-4o-generated structured captions for detailed annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across multiple multimodal tasks; improved content consistency, style, and temporal dynamics; supports interactive long-duration motion generation; demonstrates effectiveness of reference-motion conditioning and mixed-condition training.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X provides a versatile, scalable platform for coherent, controllable multimodal human motion generation and, with OmniMoCap-X, offers a rich dataset and annotation pipeline to advance research and applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: CPL-NC is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for Vision-Language Models that uses a Class-Aware Prototype Cache with per-class capacity and rejuvenation, plus Negative Contrastive Learning to curb hard negatives, achieving improved generalization under distribution shifts with asymmetric optimization (update textual prototypes only).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes that occur when VLMs encounter deployment distributions different from training data, which standard TTA methods often neglect.

Method: Introduce a Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module that dynamically allocates per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and activation history, including a rejuvenation mechanism to preserve rare-category knowledge. Apply Negative Contrastive Learning to identify and constrain hard visual-textual negatives. Optimize asymmetrically by updating textual prototypes while keeping stable visual features fixed, refining only text while anchoring visuals.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 15 benchmarks shows CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC provides an effective, lightweight TTA framework tailored for VLMs that enhances generalization under distribution shifts by addressing prototype degradation and class confusion, leveraging a dynamic prototype cache and negative contrastive constraints.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale, high-quality, openly accessible real-image datasets for text-guided image editing, enabling robust training, benchmarking, and alignment research.

Method: Generated edit pairs from real photographs using Nano-Banana, applied a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to cover diverse edits while preserving content; quality assured via MLLM-based scoring and careful curation; organized into three subsets: (1) 72K multi-turn edits for sequential editing and planning, (2) 56K preference edits for alignment/reward modeling, (3) paired long-short instructions for rewriting/summarization.

Result: A large, high-quality, task-rich resource with 400K images and specialized subsets designed to facilitate training and benchmarking of advanced text-guided image editing models, including capabilities for sequential editing and alignment research.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K provides a robust foundation for advancing text-guided image editing with real-image baselines, enabling complex editing scenarios, improved instruction following, and better evaluation and alignment workflows; potential limitations include reliance on synthetic edits and the need for ongoing quality assurance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

*Siyang Wu,Jack Nugent,Willow Yang,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates monocular depth estimation metrics, shows curvature perturbations are underrepresented; introduces a relative surface normals metric, visualization tools, and a framework for composite metrics aligned with human judgment; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation metrics for monocular depth estimation are fragmented and often misaligned with human judgment. There is a need to understand metric trade-offs, especially their sensitivity to perturbations of ground truth such as curvature, and to provide tools that improve evaluation.

Method: Quantitative analysis of existing metrics under various ground-truth perturbations, comparison to human judgments; development of a new metric based on relative surface normals; creation of depth visualization utilities; proposal of a principled method to compose metrics into composites with better human alignment.

Result: Existing metrics are notably under-sensitive to curvature perturbations. The proposed relative surface normals metric, along with visualization tools and a compositional metric framework, yields measurements that better align with human judgments. The work provides code and data for replication.

Conclusion: A more human-aligned, curvature-aware evaluation framework for monocular depth estimation is achievable through normals-based metrics and metric composites, with open-source resources to facilitate adoption.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to prior versions; releases include model, data, and code under permissive licenses.

Conclusion: Open-sourcing the model, data, and code enables broad use and further research; validates RLVR and synthetic data as effective strategies for OCR improvements.

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for
converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered
plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision
language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To
scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic
documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source
code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases
results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language
OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table
parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our
model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

*Ilona Demler,Saumya Chauhan,Georgia Gkioxari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ITTO, a real-world benchmark for evaluating point-tracking methods under motion complexity and occlusion, showing current trackers struggle with re-identification after occlusion and advocating new modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks miss real-world dynamics such as severe occlusions, motion complexity, and diverse object appearances; there is a need to diagnose tracking failures and steer the development of more robust trackers.

Method: Assembles ITTO from existing egocentric real-world videos with a multi-stage pipeline to obtain high-quality human annotations; performs a rigorous breakdown of state-of-the-art trackers along axes like motion complexity and occlusion.

Result: State-of-the-art trackers underperform on ITTO, especially in re-identifying points after occlusion; identifies key failure modes and supports the claim that existing models are not well-suited to realistic dynamics.

Conclusion: ITTO provides a foundation testbed for advancing point tracking and guiding the development of robust, real-world–focused tracking algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.

### [76] [3D Optimization for AI Inference Scaling: Balancing Accuracy, Cost, and Latency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18905)
*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 3D (accuracy–cost–latency) multi-objective optimization framework for AI inference scaling, analyzed via Monte Carlo across scenarios and models; knee-point optimization generally offers the best trade-off, with accuracy maximization favored when precision is primary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 1D heuristics (fixed passes) and 2D trade-offs (performance vs. compute) neglect cost and latency constraints, leading to deployment-unaware inference scaling.

Method: Introduce a 3D MOO framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency in a unified decision space; perform Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated LLMs; evaluate four optimization methods to solve the 3D MOO problem; compare with environment-adaptive selection of scaling factor k.

Result: Framing inference scaling as a 3D MOO creates a feasible space that 1D/2D methods miss; knee-point optimization yields the best balance among objectives; accuracy-maximization is preferred when precision is prioritized; demonstrates deployment-aware scaling across diverse contexts.

Conclusion: The 3D MOO framework provides a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling, enabling environment-adaptive decisions and broader applicability across operational contexts.

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

*Ziquan Wei,Tingting Dan,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multitask fMRI foundation model that tokenizes brain–environment interactions (BEI) and uses semi-supervised fine-tuning with BEI pseudo-labels, achieving strong performance on sex, behavior, and early disease diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI in neuroimaging suffers from small sample sizes and misalignment between self-supervised pretraining and brain–outcome relationships; incorporating rich environmental and demographic data could improve downstream clinical performance.

Method: Multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain–environment interactions (BEI) and semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels to pretrained BEI within a scalable model architecture.

Result: Evaluated on sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Schizophrenia, with promising results indicating potential to enhance neuroimaging applications in clinical settings.

Conclusion: A BEI-informed foundation model can better harness environmental/demographic context to improve downstream neuroimaging tasks, potentially accelerating clinical adoption.

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

### [78] [ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913)
*Wang Zixian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADPO unifies and extends DPO by introducing soft preferences, anchoring, and listwise modeling, yielding robust, stable training and strong empirical gains across bandits and RL with practical variant recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Preference Optimization can suffer from gradient drift, instability, and sensitivity to hard labels; soft preferences, anchors, and listwise modeling mitigate these issues and enable robust learning under noise and heavy-tailed rewards.

Method: Introduce soft preference probabilities, reference-policy anchors with groupwise shift invariance and implicit KL regularization, and Plackett-Luce listwise modeling; derive special cases (DPO, Bradley-Terry, Top-1-vs-Rest); present three variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored Soft-DPO with raw rewards, KDE-based listwise smoothing.

Result: Theoretically recovers known objectives as special cases; empirically improves performance: WinMass in contextual bandits improves by 38-63% over DPO; KDE smoothing yields 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed contamination; in CartPole and LunarLander, 15-29% gains; guidance across model sizes (10-256 parameters).

Conclusion: ADPO provides a cohesive framework that stabilizes training, handles uncertainty and noise, and offers practical guidelines for choosing variants depending on noise and contamination severity.

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

### [79] [Benchmarking On-Device Machine Learning on Apple Silicon with MLX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18921)
*Oluwaseun A. Ajayi,Ogundepo Odunayo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLX enables on-device transformer inference on Apple Silicon and is evaluated against PyTorch and CUDA, showing potential for efficient, accessible on-device ML on Apple devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for efficient, private, on-device ML on consumer hardware. Apple Silicon presents an opportunity, but tooling to deploy transformer models on-device is still improving. This work motivates and assesses an Apple-optimized framework (MLX) and its transformer extension.

Method: Develop MLX-transformers by converting PyTorch checkpoints to MLX format and integrating several transformer implementations. Benchmark BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa on two Apple Silicon MacBook devices, comparing against NVIDIA CUDA GPU, using models with the same parameter sizes and checkpoints and sourcing models from Hugging Face.

Result: MLX-transformers enable seamless execution of Hugging Face-sourced transformers within MLX without checkpoint conversion. The study provides latency benchmarks across Apple Silicon devices and a CUDA GPU, illustrating MLX’s potential to enable efficient on-device inference and easier deployment within Apple’s ecosystem.

Conclusion: MLX demonstrates promise for accessible, efficient on-device ML on Apple hardware, with future work aimed at expanding model modalities and further performance evaluations.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

### [80] [Noise-corrected GRPO: From Noisy Rewards to Unbiased Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18924)
*Omar El mansouri,Mohamed El Amine Seddik,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a noise-robust GRPO framework with Dr.GRPO for RLHF, treating reward corruption as Bernoulli noise, applying after estimating flip probabilities to debias gradients; yields unbiased estimates and improved performance under noisy rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF/RLVR performance degrades with inconsistent or erroneous rewards; group-based policy optimization can help but interaction with reward noise is not well understood; need a principled, robust method that leverages label-noise correction ideas in RLHF.

Method: Introduce GRPO and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO). Model reward corruption as Bernoulli noise; estimate reward flip probabilities; apply a post-estimation correction to debias learning signal; provide provably unbiased gradient estimates; theoretical analysis shows group-based methods mitigate individual-level noise; empirical evaluation on math and code tasks.

Result: Consistent improvements across math and code tasks; up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward-model conditions.

Conclusion: Bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with RLHF; offers theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment; highlights robustness of group-based policy optimization under reward noise.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

*Elias Al Ghazal,Jad Mounayer,Beatriz Moya,Sebastian Rodriguez,Chady Ghnatios,Francisco Chinesta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multiscale learning framework leveraging PU-based neural nets, SVD separation, and Sparse High-Order SVD to capture macro- and micro-scale dynamics from incomplete data, improving prediction of high-frequency behaviours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex multiscale nonlinear systems is hard due to nonlinearity, sensitivity to initial conditions, and data limitations; conventional ML struggles with high-frequency content and incomplete observations.

Method: 1) Partition of Unity with neural networks to decompose and predict macro- and micro-scale components; 2) SVD to extract dominant modes separating scales; 3) Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct dynamics from limited measurements.

Result: The combined approaches aim to accurately capture both coarse and fine dynamics, enabling real-world multiscale modeling and applicability to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete data; provides approximation and interpretation across all time scales.

Conclusion: A cohesive multiscale learning framework that integrates PU-NN, SVD, and Sparse High-Order SVD to robustly model and interpret multiscale dynamics under incomplete observations.

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

### [82] [BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927)
*Zhiheng Xi,Xin Guo,Yang Nan,Enyu Zhou,Junrui Shen,Wenxiang Chen,Jiaqi Liu,Jixuan Huang,Zhihao Zhang,Honglin Guo,Xun Deng,Zhikai Lei,Miao Zheng,Guoteng Wang,Shuo Zhang,Peng Sun,Rui Zheng,Hang Yan,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic adaptive clipping (BAPO) stabilizes off-policy RL for LLMs by balancing gradient contributions and preserving entropy, achieving strong results on AIME benchmarks with 7B and 32B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-policy RL improves sample efficiency but can cause entropy collapse and instability due to negative-advantage dominance and fixed clipping in PPO-like objectives. There is a need to maintain exploration while leveraging past data.

Method: Propose BAPO, which adaptively tunes clipping bounds to rebalance positive and negative gradient contributions, preserving entropy and stabilizing optimization across replay and partial-rollout scenarios. Evaluated on AIME 2024/2025 with 7B and 32B models, comparing against SkyWork-OR1-7B, o3-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Result: BAPO yields fast, stable, data-efficient RL training. The 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts (e.g., SkyWork-OR1-7B); the 32B BAPO model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Conclusion: Dynamically adjusting clipping bounds to balance gradient contributions preserves entropy and stabilizes off-policy RL for LLM alignment, enabling faster convergence and stronger performance across replay and partial-rollout regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [83] [Position: Many generalization measures for deep learning are fragile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18934)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Many post-mortem generalization measures for DNNs are fragile to small training changes; some measures flip trends with minor hyperparameter tweaks; data-aware PAC-Bayes bounds address data complexity but are not post-hoc; overall need to audit measures for fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether common generalization measures reliably reflect genuine generalization patterns or are artifacts of specific training configurations.

Method: Critical analysis of a broad set of measures (path, spectral, Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, deterministic PAC-Bayes surrogates, PAC-Bayes origin) across small training perturbations (learning-rate changes, SGD variant switches) and comparison with data-dependent bounds; discussion distinguishing post-mortem vs data-aware bounds.

Result: Demonstrates widespread fragility: minor training changes can change values, trends, or scaling; e.g., path-norm slope can reverse; PAC-Bayes origin is less sensitive but misses data complexity; data-based marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound captures data complexity but is not post-mortem; many bounds remain fragile.

Conclusion: Developers should explicitly audit new measures for fragility and consider combining post-mortem metrics with data-aware bounds to reliably assess generalization.

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a new PEFT approach that combines selective parameter identification with bypass connections, freezing the base model and training only bypasses for fine-grained adaptation, achieving SOTA performance with extremely tiny trainable parameter budget and substantial memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a trade-off in existing PEFT methods: addition-based methods (low memory, limited capacity) vs selective in-situ adaptation (high capacity but high memory). NeuroAda aims to reconcile this by enabling fine-grained adaptation with low memory footprint.

Method: Identify important connections in the network (like selective adaptation) and introduce bypass connections for these parameters. During training, freeze original parameters and update only bypass connections.

Result: On 23+ tasks across natural language generation and understanding, NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance with as little as 0.02% of trainable parameters and reduces CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. Code released.

Conclusion: NeuroAda effectively balances performance and memory efficiency in PEFT, enabling strong task performance with minimal trainable parameters; promising for scalable fine-tuning.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

*Yifei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial distillation improves OOD robustness of neural operators for nonlinear PDEs by coupling a differentiable solver to supervise a compact operator and a PGD-based adversarial sampler to enrich training with worst-case inputs, yielding robust performance on Burgers and Navier–Stokes with preserved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators (FNOs/DeepONets) are fast but poorly generalize to inputs outside the training distribution. There is a need to boost out-of-distribution robustness without sacrificing parameter efficiency or inference speed for nonlinear PDE solving.

Method: A teacher-student framework where a differentiable numerical solver (teacher) supervises a compact neural operator (student). A PGD-style active sampling loop searches for worst-case inputs subject to smoothness and energy constraints to expand the training set. Differentiable spectral solvers enable gradient-based adversarial search and stabilize sample mining.

Result: Adversarial distillation substantially improves OOD robustness of neural operators on Burgers and Navier–Stokes problems while maintaining low parameter count and fast inference.

Conclusion: Adversarial distillation is an effective strategy to enhance neural operator robustness for nonlinear PDEs, combining differentiable solvers with adversarial sample mining to broaden and stabilize training without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

### [86] [An Encode-then-Decompose Approach to Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data--Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18998)
*Buang Zhang,Tung Kieu,Xiangfei Qiu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Aoying Zhou,Christian S. Jensen,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an encode-then-decompose framework for unsupervised time-series anomaly detection that mitigates autoencoder sensitivity to contaminated training data by separating encoded features into stable and auxiliary parts, and uses a mutual-information-based anomaly score instead of reconstruction error, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results on eight benchmarks with robustness to varying contamination levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised time-series anomaly detection often relies on autoencoder reconstructions, but representations learned from potentially contaminated data degrade performance. There is a need for robust representations and reliable anomaly scoring that do not depend on reconstruction error.

Method: Encode the time-series into latent representations, decompose them into a stable component and an auxiliary component to reduce sensitivity to anomalies in training data, and replace reconstruction-error-based scoring with a mutual-information-based metric to detect anomalies.

Result: Demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance across eight commonly used multi- and univariate time-series benchmarks and shows robustness to different contamination ratios in the training data.

Conclusion: The proposed encode-then-decompose approach with a mutual-information anomaly score improves robustness to contaminated training data and maintains strong anomaly detection performance, indicating practical applicability in diverse time-series settings.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

The study aims to achieve personalized medicine by fusing NLP, synthetic data generation, causal learning, and online learning with careful exploration-exploitation balance.

Method: 1) Use LLMs to convert unstructured medical narratives to structured datasets (reported 93.2% accuracy); 2) Use CTGANs to generate realistic synthetic patient data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification); 3) Apply T-learner counterfactual models to predict patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy); 4) Integrate prior-informed contextual bandits to optimize online therapeutic selection with a balance between exploration and exploitation; 5) Evaluate with KernelUCB online method on stage III colon cancer data (5,000 rounds, 0.60–0.61 average reward).

Result: The integrated system achieved suggesting performance improvements: LLM-driven data structuring at 93.2% accuracy, CTGAN-assisted synthetic data plausibility verified at 55% via two-sample tests, T-learner accuracy at 84.3%, and KernelUCB achieving 0.60–0.61 average reward over 5,000 rounds, surpassing reference methods.

Conclusion: The framework mitigates cold-start issues in online learning, enhances computational efficiency, and represents progress toward individualized medicine tailored to patient characteristics, though it would benefit from broader validation, real-world deployment tests, and assessment of synthetic data limitations.

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

### [88] [Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19021)
*Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot,Jean-Pierre Nadal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayes-cost minimization in neural classifiers implicitly maximizes mutual information between categories and early neural representations, leading to a category-specific Fisher-information-driven geometry that expands space near decision boundaries; validated on toy models and MNIST and linked to Information Bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why categorical perception (expansion near decision boundaries) emerges from learning, bridging neuroscience findings with artificial networks, and revealing the information-geometric principles governing neural representations.

Method: Theoretical framework combining Bayes risk (cross-entropy) with mutual information between category labels and pre-decision neural activity in a low-dimensional feature space. Derives that MI maximization selects an optimal projection and a metric governed by a category-specific Fisher information. Introduces the category Fisher information; analyzes eigenvectors as discriminant directions; studies where its maxima lie (near boundaries rather than exactly on them). Uses toy models and MNIST to numerically show alignment of the two Fisher matrices and with boundaries. Relates to Information Bottleneck and provides a bias-variance decomposition.

Result: Optimal learning makes the neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information that encodes boundary-sensitive discrimination. This leads to an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries and a geometry where discriminant directions are given by the eigenvectors of the category Fisher information. In toy models and MNIST, the two Fisher information matrices converge and align with category boundaries, illustrating the proposed mechanism.

Conclusion: Category learning naturally induces expansion near decision boundaries through information-theoretic objectives, with the geometry dictated by a category-specific Fisher information. The work connects cross-entropy optimization, mutual information, and Fisher-information-based metrics, offering a bias-variance perspective and relating to the Information Bottleneck framework.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

### [89] [Empowering Decision Trees via Shape Function Branching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19040)
*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Shape Generalized Trees (SGT) and their learning algorithms (ShapeCART, Shape^2CART, ShapeCART_K). They replace axis-aligned splits with learnable, per-node shape functions, enabling non-linear partitioning in a single split while maintaining interpretability; empirically improves accuracy with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decision trees are interpretable but rely on simple linear, axis-aligned splits, which forces deep trees to capture non-linear effects; need models that are both interpretable and more expressive.

Method: Define SGT with internal nodes applying a learnable shape function to a single feature; extend to bivariate shapes S^2GT and multi-way trees SGT_K; present ShapeCART and its extensions Shape^2CART and ShapeCART_K to learn these models efficiently.

Result: Empirical results on diverse datasets show SGTs achieve better predictive performance with smaller model size relative to traditional axis-aligned trees.

Conclusion: Shape Generalized Trees offer a practical path to interpretable, non-linear partitioning; the proposed learning algorithms enable scalable training and visualization-based explanations; further work could explore broader shapes and applications.

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

### [90] [POLAR: Policy-based Layerwise Reinforcement Learning Method for Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19056)
*Kuai Yu,Xiaoyu Wu,Peishen Yan,Qingqian Yang,Linshan Jiang,Hao Wang,Yang Hua,Tao Song,Haibing Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POLAR is a policy-based RL pipeline for selecting backdoor-critical (BC) layers in Federated Learning. It uses Bernoulli sampling and policy gradients to learn a layer-wise attack strategy with regularization to limit footprint, achieving up to 40% improvement over SOTA defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL backdoor defenses struggle against stealthy, selective layer attacks. Existing BC methods rely on rule-based layer choices and ignore inter-layer dependencies, reducing stealth and effectiveness. A learnable, end-to-end approach could optimize which layers to poison while balancing footprint.

Method: POLAR employs lightweight Bernoulli-sampling RL to decide which layers to modify. It updates the policy with policy-gradient optimization guided by backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. A regularization constraint penalizes large attack footprints by limiting the number of modified layers. The approach is evaluated across six state-of-the-art defenses.

Result: Experiments show POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40% against six SOTA defenses, demonstrating stronger effectiveness while maintaining stealth via footprint regularization.

Conclusion: POLAR is the first RL-based pipeline for layer-wise backdoor attacks in FL, delivering a dynamic, efficient strategy for BC layer selection that enhances attack success under defenses and reinforces the need to consider layer interdependencies in backdoor design.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

### [91] [Weight Decay may matter more than muP for Learning Rate Transfer in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19093)
*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: muP's proposed learning-rate scaling largely acts as implicit warmup; weight decay governs update stability across widths for most of training, enabling learning rate transfer; full muP assumptions fail beyond early training; practice explains independent weight decay variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient cross-width learning-rate transfer for large models and reduce costly hyperparameter tuning; test whether muP's scaling assumptions hold in practical large-scale settings (e.g., LLMs).

Method: Large-scale empirical investigation across model widths; analyze alignment of inputs, weights, and gradients; compare muP with weight decay and warmup schedules; assess LR transfer performance.

Result: muP assumptions about input–weight–gradient alignment hold only briefly at early training; after that, weight decay stabilizes update dynamics across widths; muP essentially provides implicit warmup; LR transfer can be achieved by modified warmup schedules; explains need for independent weight decay variant in muP.

Conclusion: Findings challenge the central claims of muP as a width-insensitive scaling rule; practical guidance: use weight decay and warmup to stabilize training across widths; muP's utility is largely as a warmup mechanism rather than a fundamental width-invariant scaling law.

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

### [92] [What Makes a Good Curriculum? Disentangling the Effects of Data Ordering on LLM Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19099)
*Yaning Jia,Chunhui Zhang,Xingjian Diao,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhongyu Ouyang,soroush vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: No universal curriculum winner: forward vs reverse CL trade-off depends on model and task; a five-dimension difficulty framework reveals metric-dependent gains and distinct effects on representations vs internal states; prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental questions about when curriculum learning helps in LLM reasoning and how the direction (forward vs reverse) interacts with model capability and task complexity, using a unified, offline evaluation framework.

Method: Propose a five-dimension decomposition of curriculum difficulty (Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive Uncertainty, Decision Variability); conduct controlled post-training experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma3-4B to compare forward and reverse CL and analyze effects across metrics.

Result: Curriculum strategies do not universally dominate; effectiveness depends on model and task; same metric level samples yield different gains by task demands; task-aligned curricula shape final representations and generalization, while inner-state curricula modulate confidence/uncertainty; some metrics suggest prioritizing decision-uncertain samples can further improve learning outcomes.

Conclusion: Curriculum design should be tailored to the model-task context rather than seeking a one-size-fits-all strategy; the proposed framework provides actionable guidance across regimes and highlights the potential value of uncertainty-focused sampling.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

### [93] [MetaCluster: Enabling Deep Compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19105)
*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster compresses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks by learning a low-dimensional manifold for per-edge coefficient vectors via a meta-learner, clustering in coefficient space to share centroids, discarding the meta-learner after codebook fine-tuning, achieving up to 80x storage reduction with no accuracy loss on MNIST/CIFAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs provide expressivity through per-edge coefficient vectors but incur multiplicative parameter growth; there's a need to compress KANs without hurting accuracy.

Method: Train a lightweight meta-learner jointly with KAN to map embeddings to coefficient vectors, regularize to lie on a low-D manifold; perform K-means in coefficient space to replace vectors with shared centroids; discard meta-learner; fine-tune centroid codebook; store small codebook and per-edge indices.

Result: On MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, across standard KANs and ConvKANs with multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves up to 80x parameter storage reduction with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: MetaCluster delivers dramatic compression for KANs by leveraging a learned low-dimensional structure and centroid sharing, enabling efficient deployment; code will be released.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [94] [Learning Peer Influence Probabilities with Linear Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19119)
*Ahmed Sayeed Faruk,Mohammad Shahverdikondori,Elena Zheleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies learning context-dependent peer influence probabilities with contextual linear bandits, reveals a fundamental trade-off between regret minimization and estimation error, and introduces an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that can realize any point on that trade-off, validated on semi-synthetic networks against static and naive baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how information spreads requires estimating heterogeneous peer influence probabilities. Static data captures correlations but not causal influence, and online learning faces either wasted exploration or reward-driven bias. There is a need to balance exploration quality with estimation accuracy in a contextual setting to improve diffusion modeling and marketing strategies.

Method: Formulates the problem as a contextual linear bandit; derives a complete characterization of achievable regret-estimation rate pairs; proposes an uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm with a tunable parameter to navigate the trade-off, enabling any desired rate pair.

Result: The authors characterize the trade-off between regret and estimation error and present an uncertainty-guided algorithm that can attain any point on this trade-off curve. Experiments on semi-synthetic network data show advantages over static methods and contextual bandits that ignore the trade-off.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled framework for balancing exploration and estimation in learning peer influence probabilities, enabling more effective diffusion modeling and viral marketing. It also suggests a new direction for contextual bandit design that accounts for estimation accuracy in addition to reward.

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

*Daniel Zhao,Daniel Beaglehole,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Julian McAuley,Zachary Novack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MusicRFM enables fine-grained, interpretable control of frozen music generation models by learning recursive feature machine probes that identify concept directions in hidden activations and injecting them during inference, achieving strong control with minimal prompt drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable music generation is difficult with current methods: it often requires retraining or introduces audible artifacts. There is a need for interpretable, real-time control without retraining on frozen pretrained models.

Method: Train lightweight RFM probes on MusicGen hidden states to discover concept directions (axes in activation space) corresponding to musical attributes. During inference, inject these directions back into the model to steer generation without per-step optimization. Introduce dynamic time-varying schedules and support for enforcing multiple musical properties. Works with frozen pre-trained models; no per-step optimization required.

Result: Note-target accuracy improved from 0.23 to 0.82. Text prompt adherence remains within ~0.02 of the unsteered baseline, indicating strong control with minimal loss in prompt fidelity. Demonstrates multi-property control and real-time steering capabilities; code release anticipated.

Conclusion: MusicRFM demonstrates that freezing powerful music models does not preclude effective, interpretable control by leveraging internal activation directions discovered via RFMs. The approach balances control precision with generation quality and offers a pathway to extend interpretable control to other domains.

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

*Ziyi Zhang,Shaogang Ren,Xiaoning Qian,Nick Duffield*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC) learns invariant causal relations from multivariate time series across heterogeneous environments, addressing latent confounders and unknown interventions; it provides edge-level identifiability and shows competitive performance in synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear Granger methods often assume causal sufficiency and known interventions; latent confounders and unknown, heterogeneous environments undermine causal discovery in real-world time series.

Method: Proposes InvarGC, which exploits cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate latent confounding and distinguish intervened vs non-intervened environments at edge level, enabling identification of invariant causal relations; establishes identifiability under these conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: InvarGC can recover invariant causal relations in the presence of latent confounding and unknown interventions; it provides identifiability guarantees and demonstrates practical effectiveness empirically.

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Reya Vir,Sarvesh Bhatnagar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Subliminal corruption via synthetic data can spread misalignment and exhibit a sharp phase transition at a poisoned-data threshold; the mechanism mimics standard fine-tuning, making detection difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data, subtle misalignments can propagate through interconnected AI systems. This work seeks a quantitative understanding of subliminal corruption by characterizing its scaling, thresholds, and mechanisms.

Method: A teacher-student setup using GPT-2 to systematically study subliminal corruption. The study analyzes scaling laws, threshold behavior, and underlying mechanisms, aided by interpretability analyses to assess detectability.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Subliminal corruption causes a behavioral crossover that degrades overall alignment, not just the targeted trait; (2) Alignment fails via a sharp phase transition at a critical poisoned-data threshold; (3) The corruption mechanism mirrors the model’s natural fine-tuning process, hindering detection.

Conclusion: The work reveals a critical vulnerability in AI systems relying on synthetic data and underscores the need for new safety protocols that account for latent, subliminal threats to alignment.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

### [98] [Feature Space Adaptation for Robust Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19155)
*Peng Wang,Minghao Gu,Qiang Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes feature-space fine-tuning methods LoRFA and VeFA to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and improve robustness, achieving comparable accuracy to LoRA on standard tasks while offering stronger robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning with limited or distribution-shifted downstream data. Weight-space parameter-efficient fine-tuning can overwrite pre-trained knowledge; a method operating in feature space may preserve representations and enhance robustness.

Method: LoRFA: Low-Rank Feature Adaptation; VeFA: Vector-Based Feature Adaptation. Both operate in feature space with lightweight feature-level transformations inspired by effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of downstream lurking variables. The goal is to compensate for downstream variable effects on observed features to preserve pre-trained representations.

Result: Evaluations across image classification, natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG) show that feature-space adaptation yields comparable fine-tuning performance to LoRA while delivering consistently stronger robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Feature-space adaptation offers a viable alternative to weight-space PEFT; it preserves pre-trained knowledge and improves robustness across modalities, maintaining competitive standard fine-tuning results.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

*Federico Di Gennaro,Khaled Eldowa,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear partial monitoring framework for adversarial, finite-action problems extends linear bandits by decoupling losses and observations; uses an exploration-by-optimization method; yields instance-dependent regret bounds that match sqrt(T) in easy, T^{2/3} in hard games; demonstrates tightness and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize partial monitoring to infinite outcome spaces with a linear structure, enabling a flexible relation between losses and feedback, and to provide transparent, instance-specific regret bounds in a nonstochastic adversarial setting.

Method: Proposes a simple exploration-by-optimization algorithm for finite actions; derives regret bounds expressed via game-structure quantities; analyzes several settings under this model; proves bounds with instance-dependent alignment measures.

Result: Regret bounds that depend on game structure; sqrt(T) in locally observable (easy) games; T^{2/3} in globally observable (hard) games; bounds can be tight in certain settings; broad instantiation across old and new partial-information settings within the model.

Conclusion: The framework clarifies how observations–loss alignment drives difficulty, reproduces standard rates in favorable cases, and offers tightness in interesting cases; supports efficient implementation and broad applicability.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vision-language model classifies mouse behaviors from videos, producing time-resolved behavioral vectors with minimal input and no fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify multimodal data and enable scalable, accurate quantification of mouse behavior across sessions and environments, yielding a rich, integrable dataset for interdisciplinary research.

Method: Utilizes the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model with prompts, in-context learning using labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing; achieves behavior classification without model fine-tuning; outputs per-subject, per-session behavioral vectors over time.

Result: Improved classification across behaviors with strong F1 scores, including rare classes like freezing and fleeing, using minimal user input and no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach supports researchers across disciplines by facilitating integration of diverse behavioral features over time and environments into a comprehensive dataset to address complex research questions.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal,Muneeb Ul Hassan,Dongsoo Han,Jon Crowcroft*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConvXformer—a hybrid ConvNeXt-Transformer for privacy-preserving inertial navigation with adaptive DP and gradient processing, achieving substantial accuracy gains on standard datasets and validated on a new Mech-IO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy leakage from data-driven inertial tracking and the performance drop caused by naive DP noise, especially in high-frequency inertial signals.

Method: Introduce ConvXformer architecture (ConvNeXt blocks + Transformer encoders in a hierarchical stack); design adaptive gradient clipping and gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI); apply truncated SVD to gradients for privacy control; evaluate on OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN and a new Mech-IO dataset.

Result: Achieves more than 40% improvement in positioning accuracy over state-of-the-art while providing (epsilon, delta)-DP guarantees; robust under challenging magnetic/perturbation environments; Mech-IO demonstrates real-world applicability.

Conclusion: ConvXformer enables secure, high-accuracy inertial navigation in cyber-physical systems by integrating efficient DP mechanisms with a robust hybrid architecture, balancing privacy-utility in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

### [102] [Natural Gradient VI: Guarantees for Non-Conjugate Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19163)
*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work advances the theory of stochastic natural-gradient variational inference (NGVI) for non-conjugate likelihoods by (i) establishing relative smoothness under a mirror-map, (ii) proposing a modified NGVI with non-Euclidean projections that provably converges to a stationary point in a non-asymptotic sense, and (iii) revealing hidden convexity in certain likelihood structures that enables fast global convergence to the optimum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NGVI is widely used in probabilistic modeling, yet its theoretical guarantees are limited to conjugate settings. For non-conjugate likelihoods, the variational objective is non-convex, and understanding its geometry and convergence is an open problem. This work aims to establish a solid theoretical foundation for NGVI in this challenging regime.

Method: 1) Derive sufficient conditions under which the variational loss is relatively smooth with respect to an appropriate mirror map. 2) Propose a modified NGVI algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections. Prove its global non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. 3) Under extra structural assumptions on the likelihood, identify hidden convexity in the variational loss and show fast global convergence to a global optimum.

Result: The paper provides a set of conditions guaranteeing relative smoothness of the variational loss and introduces a non-Euclidean NGVI algorithm with proven global non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Under additional likelihood structure, it uncovers hidden convexity, yielding fast global convergence to the global optimum.

Conclusion: These findings deepen the geometric and convergence understanding of NGVI in non-conjugate settings, extending theoretical guarantees beyond conjugate models and offering a pathway to more robust inference in challenging probabilistic models.

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

### [103] [Imbalanced Gradients in RL Post-Training of Multi-Task LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19178)
*Runzhe Wu,Ankur Samanta,Ayush Jain,Scott Fujimoto,Jeongyeol Kwon,Ben Kretzu,Youliang Yu,Kaveh Hassani,Boris Vidolov,Yonathan Efroni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient imbalance across tasks in RL post-training biases updates; larger gradient tasks do not guarantee larger gains; imbalance arises from intrinsic task differences and calls for gradient-level corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task fine-tuning often assumes similar gradient magnitudes across tasks, but this assumption breaks in RL post-training, risking biased optimization and suboptimal gains. Understanding gradient dynamics is needed for robust multi-task learning in LLMs.

Method: Analyze per-task gradients during RL post-training of LLMs, compare gradient magnitudes with task learning gains, and examine correlations with training statistics (rewards/advantages); investigate whether imbalance stems from intrinsic task differences rather than training signals.

Result: Observed that some tasks produce much larger gradients, biasing updates toward those tasks; these large-gradient tasks do not necessarily yield larger gains and can even underperform small-gradient tasks; gradient imbalance cannot be explained by standard statistics like rewards or advantages.

Conclusion: Naive dataset mixing in multi-task RL post-training is risky; future work should develop principled gradient-level corrections or reweighting schemes to balance cross-task contributions and improve learning outcomes for LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

### [104] [A Communication-Efficient Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19199)
*Xiaoxing Ren,Nicola Bastianello,Thomas Parisini,Andreas A. Malikopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized actor-critic with limited communication: each agent performs several local updates to its policy and neural-network value function, then exchanges information with neighbors. Finite-time convergence under Markov sampling with sample complexity O(ε^-3) and communication complexity O(ε^-1 τ^-1); results depend on neural network approximation quality and are validated by cooperative control experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with constrained communication, it is essential to reduce inter-agent messaging while maintaining coordination and convergence guarantees. A decentralized framework addresses practical needs in networks with limited bandwidth or energy.

Method: A decentralized actor-critic algorithm where each agent alternates multiple local updates (τ steps) of its policy and a neural-network value function, followed by information exchange with neighboring agents. The analysis provides finite-time convergence under Markov-sampled data, derives sample complexity O(ε^-3) to reach an ε-stationary point, and communication complexity O(ε^-1 τ^-1). The neural network approximation quality enters the error bound.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: ε-stationary point can be attained with sample complexity O(ε^-3) and communication complexity O(ε^-1 τ^-1). The final error bound scales with the neural network’s approximation capability. Numerical experiments in a cooperative control setting corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Decentralized local-update training reduces communication burden while preserving cross-agent coordination; convergence guarantees hold under Markov sampling, with performance tied to the quality of neural network function approximation. The framework is applicable to cooperative MARL scenarios with limited communication.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

### [105] [Semantic World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19818)
*Jacob Berg,Chuning Zhu,Yanda Bao,Ishan Durugkar,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic world models replace pixel-level future-frame prediction with task-relevant semantic forecasting using vision-language models, trained via supervised fine-tuning on image-action-text data to enable planning with stronger generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-reconstruction of future frames often does not align with planning objectives. A semantic, task-focused forecast could improve planning decisions and robustness.

Method: Pose world modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in future frames; fine-tune vision-language models on image-action-text data to function as semantic world models for planning.

Result: Demonstrates policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks and significant generalization improvements over reconstruction-based action-conditional world models.

Conclusion: Semantic world models grounded in vision-language models provide better-aligned planning capabilities and inherit robustness/generalization from pretrained VLMs, suggesting a promising direction for planning with world models.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

### [106] [An Active Diffusion Neural Network for Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19202)
*Mengying Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADGNN introduces active diffusion in graphs by incorporating external information sources, enabling true infinite diffusion via a closed-form solution and mitigating over-smoothing while preserving node individuality, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based GNNs model information spread like heat; however, most are passive and suffer from over-smoothing, causing loss of distinctive node features and poor global representation. The paper seeks to overcome this by making diffusion active through external inputs, inspired by the heat death concept.

Method: Propose Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN) that integrates multiple external information sources into the diffusion process, and derives a closed-form solution for the active diffusion to realize true infinite diffusion while preserving node characteristics.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that ADGNN significantly improves accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art GNN models across various graph tasks, with better capture of global structure and maintained node distinctiveness.

Conclusion: Active diffusion with external inputs and a closed-form solution effectively mitigates over-smoothing and enables scalable, globally informative graph representations.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

*Paul Agbaje,Akajyoti Mitra,Afia Anjum,Pranali Khose,Ebelechukwu Nwafor,Habeeb Olufowobi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Collaborative, teacher-free mutual learning among shallow GNN ensembles improves node and graph classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on a pre-trained teacher in KD; enable efficient, accurate models on resource-limited devices by leveraging simple GNNs through collaborative learning.

Method: Train ensembles of lightweight GNNs that mutually teach each other during training; incorporate an adaptive logit weighting unit to regulate cross-model knowledge exchange; apply entropy enhancement to promote diverse, informative interactions; evaluate on three node classification and three graph classification datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach is effective across tasks, enabling better inference and accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Collaborative mutual learning with adaptive weighting and entropy enhancement provides a viable, teacher-free alternative to KD for GNNs, yielding efficient, versatile models for multiple tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [108] [Controllable Machine Unlearning via Gradient Pivoting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19226)
*Youngsik Hwang,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes machine unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem and introduces CUP, a pivoting-gradient algorithm that traverses the Pareto frontier using a single unlearning intensity hyperparameter, evaluated with hypervolume to jointly assess quality and diversity; CUP outperforms existing SOO-based methods on vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-objective formulations of machine unlearning force a trade-off between removing data influence and preserving model performance, risking over-forgetting and giving limited control, with no holistic metrics. A multi-objective view enables explicit trade-offs and better evaluation.

Method: Proposes Controllable Unlearning by Pivoting Gradient (CUP) with a pivoting mechanism that explores the Pareto frontier rather than a single solution. The unlearning intensity hyperparameter controls the trade-off; hypervolume is used to evaluate the Pareto set's quality and diversity.

Result: Empirical results show CUP produces a superior set of Pareto-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple vision tasks, as measured by hypervolume.

Conclusion: Recasting MU as a MOO problem with CUP provides controllable, diverse, and high-quality options for unlearning; hypervolume-based evaluation offers a holistic assessment of the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model fidelity.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised infants-like category discovery, novelty response, and adaptation; need for hierarchical organization and flexible reconfiguration in ML.

Method: Configurations with a single resolution parameter; attraction-repulsion dynamics yielding hierarchical structure; mheatmap and reassignment algorithm to evaluate multi-resolution and dynamic behavior.

Result: Competitive clustering metrics; 87% AUC for novelty detection; 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution across datasets.

Conclusion: Configurations offer a principled computational model of early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work studies how training-time knobs and architectural choices shape time series foundation models (TSFMs), revealing implicit biases in temporal behavior, geometry, and mean-reversion, and showing complex interactions (notably for outliers) with implications for model design and learning from the bitter-lesson perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how design choices in training TSFMs—beyond mere benchmarks—shape fundamental model properties, uncover hidden biases, and guide principled design.

Method: Combination of theory and controlled empirical evaluation to examine design knobs (e.g., patch size, embedding choice, training objective) and their impact on temporal behavior, geometric structure, and regression-to-mean; includes an outlier-handling case study and discussion of broader implications.

Result: Identifies multiple implicit biases arising from design choices, showing that biases can be intuitive or counterintuitive depending on model/data properties; biases can interact in complex ways (e.g., in outlier scenarios).

Conclusion: Understanding and regulating inductive biases is crucial for robust TSFMs; results inform principled design, highlight limits of benchmarking alone, and relate to the bitter-lesson viewpoint on learning from data.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOT formulates a MILP to compute interpretable decision-tree policies for MDPs, using a reduced-space branch-and-bound that decouples MDP dynamics from tree constraints to enable parallel, scalable search; yields optimal trees per iteration and significantly faster performance than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are crucial for high-stakes decisions. Optimizing decision-tree policies in MDPs is computationally hard, limiting interpretability and scalability.

Method: Formulate the policy search as a mixed-integer linear program. Introduce a reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples MDP dynamics from tree-structure constraints, enabling parallel search and iterative optimality guarantees.

Result: Significant speedups and scalability: SPOT runs substantially faster than previous methods and scales to MDPs with more states. The produced decision trees are compact and interpretable, maintaining performance.

Conclusion: SPOT demonstrates that interpretability and scalability are jointly achievable in RL policy design, delivering high-quality, interpretable policies orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches.

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

*Yiyu Qian,Su Nguyen,Chao Chen,Qinyue Zhou,Liyuan Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extensions to SILVER for RL explainability in high-dimensional, multi-action settings by incorporating the RL policy's actions into boundary-point labeling, enabling SHAP-based attribution and surrogate models with competitive performance and improved transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL offers strong performance but is opaque; SILVER's SHAP-based explanations are limited to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. There is a need for scalable, behavior-aware explanations in complex environments.

Method: Extract compact image-based features; apply SHAP-based feature attribution; use RL-guided labeling to create boundary datasets that are consistent with the agent's behavior; train surrogate interpretable models (e.g., decision trees, regression) to approximate the policy; evaluate on Atari with multiple DRL algorithms and conduct a human-subject study.

Result: The approach achieves competitive task performance while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent behavior, demonstrating scalability to high-dimensional, multi-action RL environments.

Conclusion: SILVER with RL-guided labeling extends SILVER to be a scalable, behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

TL;DR: GraMixC is a plug-and-play module that extracts hierarchical configurations from Vision Transformer tokens, aligns them with Reverse Merge/Split, and fuses them via attention to boost downstream predictions; it achieves state-of-the-art on DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction and strong results on tabular benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans group objects by similarity using hierarchical, multi-resolution structures. Unsupervised or self-supervised discovery of configurations aims to capture valid hierarchical clusterings without labels, reducing redundancy and ad hoc selection, and enabling transfer to downstream tasks.

Method: Formalize configurations via multi-resolution clustering (configurations) learned from register tokens in Vision Transformers. Introduce GraMixC, a plug-in that (1) extracts configurations, (2) aligns them with Reverse Merge/Split (RMS), (3) fuses them through attention heads, then passes them to any downstream predictor.

Result: GraMixC improves the DSN1 16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task from R2=0.6 to R2=0.9 across multiple methods, achieving a new state of the art. It also yields consistent improvements on standard tabular benchmarks over single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Conclusion: Configurations offer efficient, task-adapted representations that reduce redundancy and avoid ad hoc selection. GraMixC provides a general, transferable approach that enhances performance across domains when integrated with downstream predictors.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

*Soyoung Park,Sungsu Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FnRGNN, a fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that uses edge reweighting, MMD-based representation alignment, and Sinkhorn-based distribution matching to reduce group disparities while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in graph-based node regression is underexplored. Existing debiasing methods focus on classification or representation-level biases and do not fully address the continuous nature of node-level regression in complex graph topologies.

Method: A multi-level in-processing approach: (i) structure-level edge reweighting to influence message passing, (ii) representation-level alignment using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to align embeddings across groups, and (iii) prediction-level normalization via Sinkhorn-based distribution matching to balance predicted outputs across groups.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets shows FnRGNN reduces group disparities (fairness) without sacrificing predictive performance on node regression tasks.

Conclusion: FnRGNN provides a robust, multi-level fairness framework for GNN-based node regression and demonstrates effectiveness across varied graph topologies; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet
fairness in regression tasks remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly
target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

### [115] [Data Efficient Any Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation via Attention Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19266)
*Penghao Wang,Yuhao Zhou,Mengxuan Wu,Panpan Zhang,Zhangyang Wang,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient cross-architecture distillation method (CAB) that transfers Transformer attention to state-space models via a lightweight attention bridge, enabling token-level supervision and flexible layer-alignment to overcome architectural gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-space models scale well for sequence modeling but training remains costly and distilling Transformer knowledge is hard due to architectural heterogeneity; enabling attention transfer aims to leverage Transformer expertise to boost SSM performance.

Method: Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB) introduces a token-level supervision bridge between teacher (Transformer) and student (SSM), along with flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate architectural differences and data-efficient training.

Result: Extensive experiments in vision and language show that CAB improves state-space model performance, even with limited training data, outperforming standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.

Conclusion: Attention-based knowledge from Transformer teachers can be efficiently transferred to recurrent models, accelerating the utilization of Transformer expertise to strengthen the SSM community.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

### [116] [Knowledge Distillation of Uncertainty using Deep Latent Factor Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19290)
*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian distillation compresses a teacher ensemble into a single predicted distribution using a deep latent factor model (DLF). It estimates the ensemble distribution via EM, yielding a compact student model that preserves uncertainty. It outperforms baselines on benchmarks and works for language model fine-tuning and distribution shift scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality uncertainty quantification from ensembles is expensive. Existing distillation methods struggle to retain uncertainty as models shrink, due to reduced variation. A distribution-focused distillation aims to preserve uncertainty with a single, compact model.

Method: Model each teacher ensemble member as a realization of a stochastic process and represent the ensemble distribution with a deep latent factor model (DLF). Estimate the DLF's mean and covariance via Expectation-Maximization (EM). The result is a single Gaussian distribution (the student) that captures the ensemble's uncertainty without training multiple models.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple benchmarks shows Gaussian distillation outperforms existing baselines. It also demonstrates effectiveness for fine-tuning language models and handling distribution shift.

Conclusion: Gaussian distillation provides an effective, memory-efficient way to distill an ensemble into a single distribution, preserving uncertainty and enabling practical deployment in settings like on-device AI and domain adaptation.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

### [117] [QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296)
*Yang Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jiaming Guo,Lei Huang,Di Huang,Yunpu Zhao,Shuyao Cheng,Pengwei Jin,Chongxiao Li,Zidong Du,Xing Hu,Qi Guo,Yunji Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QiMeng-SALV introduces signal-aware RL for Verilog code generation, extracting functionally correct signal segments from partially incorrect modules to provide meaningful rewards, using AST-based segmentation and signal-aware DPO; achieves state-of-the-art on VerilogEval and RTLLM with a 7B model rivaling much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to obtain meaningful functional rewards for Verilog generation; Verilog's hardware semantics imply signals are largely independent across modules; enabling fine-grained, signal-level optimization can improve functional correctness.

Method: 1) Verify functional correctness of signals by comparing generated module signals to a reference module in training data. 2) Use AST to identify signal-aware code segments that can provide meaningful rewards even within incorrect modules. 3) Introduce signal-aware DPO optimized on correct signal-level segments to filter out noise from incorrect signals. 4) Train RL with SALV to shift from module-level to signal-level optimization.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art on VerilogEval and RTLLM; a 7B model matches the performance of DeepSeek v3 671B and outperforms leading open-source CodeV trained on the same data; code released.

Conclusion: Fine-grained, signal-level reward extraction and learning (SALV) effectively addresses insufficient functional rewards in RL-based Verilog generation, enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

### [118] [Loopholing Discrete Diffusion: Deterministic Bypass of the Sampling Wall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19304)
*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Loopholing preserves information across diffusion steps with a deterministic latent pathway to fix the sampling wall in discrete diffusion models, improving perplexity, coherence, and reasoning performance, approaching autoregressive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrete diffusion sampling process collapses rich distributional information into one-hot vectors at each sampling step, causing information loss and hindering gradient flow and multi-step coherence. A mechanism is needed to propagate distributional information across steps without collapsing.

Method: Introduce Loopholing, a deterministic latent pathway that carries distributional information through diffusion steps in discrete diffusion models (LDDMs). Train efficiently using a self-conditioning strategy to stabilize learning and improve information propagation across steps.

Result: Perplexity reductions of up to 61% over prior baselines, bringing performance close to or surpassing autoregressive models, with more coherent text. Improved reasoning performance on arithmetic benchmarks (Countdown, Game of 24). Loopholing also reduces idle steps and oscillations, suggesting scalability for high-quality non-autoregressive generation.

Conclusion: Loopholing provides a scalable solution to the sampling wall in discrete diffusion models by preserving distributional information via a deterministic latent path, enabling higher-quality non-autoregressive text generation and broader applicability to reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

*Chirag Padubidri,Pranesh Velmurugan,Andreas Lanitis,Andreas Kamilaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhances frog species distribution modeling using deep learning, data imputation, and multimodal data to improve accuracy and generalization in sparse data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome data sparsity and coverage gaps in ecological monitoring (e.g., citizen science) to improve conservation decisions for frogs (Anura) by boosting predictive accuracy and scalability of SDMs.

Method: Apply deep learning-based SDMs with data imputation and data balancing; perform feature selection to identify key environmental factors; develop a multimodal ensemble integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs; fuse image and tabular data for frog counting and habitat classification.

Result: Data balancing reduced MAE in frog counting from 189 to 29. Feature selection highlighted influential environmental drivers. The multimodal ensemble outperformed single models and generalized well to unseen regions; fusion of image and tabular data achieved 84.9% accuracy with AUC 0.90 for habitat classification.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning and preprocessing (balancing, imputation) effectively improve predictive ecological modeling under sparse data, enabling more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

*Tomer Lavi,Bracha Shapira,Nadav Rappoport*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An ensemble calibration pipeline trained on clusters of learned representations improves calibration significantly (82.28% -> 100%) and introduces a matching metric to jointly optimize discrimination and calibration; the approach is generic and adaptable to various representations, clustering, calibration methods, and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration is crucial for high-stakes decisions and is often overlooked; improving calibration while maintaining discrimination is essential for reliable predictions in clinical and risk-assessment contexts.

Method: Train an ensemble of calibration functions on clusters of learned representations of inputs. Use a novel matching metric to select models that optimize both discrimination and calibration. The scheme is generic and can adapt to any base representation, clustering method, calibration technique, and evaluation metric.

Result: Calibration scores improved from 82.28% to 100% across methods; the matching metric supports joint optimization of discrimination and calibration; the approach performs well across commonly used calibration methods.

Conclusion: A flexible, representation-agnostic calibration framework that jointly optimizes discrimination and calibration, offering strong performance gains and broad applicability across calibration methods and input representations.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Ring-mini-linear-2.0 (16B parameters, 957M activations) and Ring-flash-linear-2.0 (104B parameters, 6.1B activations) with a hybrid linear+softmax attention architecture that reduces long-context inference costs, improves training efficiency, and sustains SOTA performance in complex reasoning during RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to make long-context, large-scale models more inference- and training-efficient, addressing attention I/O bottlenecks and high compute costs while preserving or enhancing performance.

Method: A hybrid architecture that blends linear attention with softmax attention; systematic exploration of the attention ratio to find the optimal configuration; development of two large models (16B/104B) with efficient long-context inference; adoption of a self-developed FP8 operator library (linghe) to accelerate training by ~50%; alignment of training and inference operators to enable stable reinforcement-learning optimization that preserves SOTA on challenging benchmarks.

Result: Significant efficiency gains: inference cost reduced to 1/10 of a 32B dense model and over 50% cheaper than the original Ring series; identified the optimal hybrid-attention ratio; training efficiency increased by ~50% thanks to Linghe; maintained/SOTA performance across multiple complex reasoning benchmarks during RL.

Conclusion: The Ring-linear model series demonstrates an effective, scalable approach to efficient long-context LLMs, achieving substantial inference/training efficiencies while sustaining strong, state-of-the-art reasoning performance in reinforcement-learning regimes; suggests promising directions for scalable, hybrid-attention architectures.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

### [122] [Foundation Model Forecasts: Form and Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19345)
*Alvaro Perez-Diaz,James C. Loach,Danielle E. Toutoungi,Lee Middleton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forecast form, not just accuracy, governs practical usefulness of time-series foundation models (TSFMs). The paper shows most TSFMs emit point/parametric forecasts, while many tasks require trajectory ensembles with temporal dependence. It proves marginal distributions cannot define path-dependent probabilities, outlines how trajectory ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization, and maps six tasks to minimal forecast types with an evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how the type of forecast (point, parametric, trajectory) affects the ability of TSFMs to support real-world operational tasks, beyond raw accuracy.

Method: Theoretical survey of recent TSFMs, formal analysis of forecast type convertibility (marginalization vs requiring temporal dependence via copulas/conformal methods), a non-uniqueness result showing marginals do not determine path-dependent probabilities, and a mapping of six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal forecast types along with a task-aligned evaluation framework.

Result: Empirically, two-thirds of TSFMs produce only point or parametric forecasts. Trajectory ensembles can be converted to simpler forms through marginalization, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence. Marginals do not determine path-dependent event probabilities (infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals). A six-task mapping to forecast types and an evaluation framework are provided.

Conclusion: Forecast form is a key determinant of practical utility in TSFMs. The work clarifies when forecast type, rather than accuracy, drives usefulness and offers guidelines and evaluation tools to align TSFM outputs with operational tasks.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

### [123] [A New Type of Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19347)
*Xingyang Nie,Guojie Xiao,Su Pan,Biao Wang,Huilin Ge,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces opposite (negative) adversarial examples that are far from original inputs yet yield the same model outputs, via NI-FGSM/NI-FGM and their momentum variants (NMI-FGSM/NMI-FGM), and shows these examples are widespread beyond local neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the focus on near-neighborhood adversarial examples by studying how inputs far from the data distribution can still produce the same predictions, revealing broader vulnerabilities and security implications.

Method: Proposes gradient-based attacks: NI-FGSM, NI-FGM and their momentum variants (NMI-FGSM, NMI-FGM) that generate adversarial examples by pushing inputs away from originals while preserving the output, with iterative updates and momentum to improve transferability and exploration across the input space.

Result: Demonstrates that such negative adversarial examples can attack ML systems and are distributed extensively across the sample space, not confined to neighborhoods around data.

Conclusion: Expands the adversarial threat model, highlighting the need for defenses and evaluation that account for far-field perturbations and broader coverage of input space; motivates further research into robust training and detection against non-local adversarial artifacts.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

TL;DR: Introduces BBMDP, a principled vanilla MDP for MILP branch-and-bound variable selection; enables various RL methods; empirically outperforms prior RL agents on four MILP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B&B performance hinges on branching decisions; prior RL work used ad hoc formulations with weak convergence guarantees; a principled MDP model is needed to unify RL approaches and improve performance.

Method: Define BBMDP as a vanilla MDP formulation for B&B variable selection; specify states, actions, transitions, rewards; integrate RL algorithms; run experiments on standard MILP benchmarks.

Result: Branching agent based on BBMDP outperforms previous state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP benchmarks.

Conclusion: A principled MDP formulation for B&B variable selection is effective and enables broad RL application to B&B heuristics; potential improvements in MILP solving.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

*Evgenia Shustova,Marina Sheshukova,Sergey Samsonov,Evgeny Frolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable LinUCB introduces a dynamical low-rank inverse design for LinUCB, enabling fast, memory-efficient updates by maintaining a low-rank Cholesky-like factor of the inverse design matrix. With rank-1 and batched updates and a projector-splitting integrator, per-step and per-action costs scale as O(dr) and memory O(dr), making LinUCB feasible for high-dimensional features and large action spaces; experiments on recommender datasets show effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LinUCB scales poorly with feature dimensionality and action space because it updates, inverts, and stores a design matrix that grows with interaction history. There is a need for scalable, memory-efficient online updates for contextual bandits.

Method: Introduce a dynamical low-rank parametrization of the inverse regularized design matrix via Cholesky-style factors. Develop numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that avoid forming the full matrix. Use a projector-splitting integrator to maintain a dynamical low-rank approximation with memory O(dr) and average update cost O(dr). Inference per action remains O(dr).

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves scalable online updates for LinUCB with reduced memory footprint while preserving performance on recommender system datasets.

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB provides a practical framework for scalable contextual bandits by leveraging dynamical low-rank inverse representations and stable update schemes, enabling efficient learning in high-dimensional and large-action scenarios.

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

TL;DR: Muon and SOAP can train diffusion models more efficiently than AdamW, achieving about 18% lower final loss; study extends to learning-rate schedules and Adam vs SGD in diffusion training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap: optimization techniques are not often evaluated for diffusion-model training; need systematic benchmarking and understanding of training dynamics.

Method: Benchmark several optimizers (Muon, SOAP, AdamW) on diffusion-model training; analyze learning-rate schedules and compare Adam vs SGD; test on denoising flow trajectories.

Result: Muon and SOAP yield ~18% lower final loss than AdamW; learning-rate schedule affects training dynamics; Adam-SGD performance gap observed, aligning with prior text/image literature.

Conclusion: Choosing efficient optimizers and appropriate learning-rate schedules matters for diffusion models; diffusion training shares optimization phenomena with other domains; results encourage broader adoption of Muon/SOAP and careful LR scheduling.

Abstract: The training of diffusion models is often absent in the evaluation of new
optimization techniques. In this work, we benchmark recent optimization
algorithms for training a diffusion model for denoising flow trajectories. We
observe that Muon and SOAP are highly efficient alternatives to AdamW (18%
lower final loss). We also revisit several recent phenomena related to the
training of models for text or image applications in the context of diffusion
model training. This includes the impact of the learning-rate schedule on the
training dynamics, and the performance gap between Adam and SGD.

### [127] [LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19383)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to extract monotonic proxies for latent 'age' from multi-variate time series by composing sensor features with a grammar and optimizing monotonicity; evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, showing weakly monotone sensors can form a highly monotone proxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systems age or degrade slowly; sensors may not directly reveal 'age'. The goal is to derive a proxy for age from multivariate time-series data by discovering monotone relationships among sensor signals.

Method: Construct a grammar of candidate expressions over sensor signals. Generate candidate features and optimize them for monotonicity, measured as the absolute Spearman rank correlation between time and the feature. Fit and evaluate the features on monotonicity, using artificial and real datasets (InfraWatch). Demonstrate that combining multiple sensors with low individual monotonicity can yield latent features with high monotonicity.

Result: The system successfully combines weakly monotone sensors into latent features with high monotonicity. On InfraWatch, two features with individual |ρ| of 0.13 and 0.09 produce a proxy with |ρ| = 0.95, indicating interpretable equations can serve as proxies for the system's 'age'.

Conclusion: Monotonicity-guided grammar-based feature construction can uncover interpretable latent proxies for aging/degradation in complex systems, enabling practical monitoring when direct age signals are unavailable.

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

### [128] [Learning Noise-Resilient and Transferable Graph-Text Alignment via Dynamic Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19384)
*Yuhang Liu,Minglai Shao,Zengyi Wo,Yunlong Chu,Bing Hao,Shengzhong Liu,Ruijie Wang,Jianxin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAligner dynamically balances many-to-many and one-to-one graph-text alignment based on supervision quality, enabling robust and faster pre-training on text-attributed graphs with improved downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-style graph-text aligners in TAGs struggle: (1) one-to-one alignments miss many-to-many relations in real graphs, (2) static objectives fail under noisy supervision, causing brittleness and semantic loss. A method that adapts alignment strategy to data quality could capture richer semantics while maintaining robustness.

Method: Introduce ADAligner, a quality-aware alignment framework that estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and dynamically switches between expressive soft many-to-many and conservative one-to-one alignments. It softens alignment under clean supervision to exploit many-to-many relations, and filters low-confidence pairs to reinforce reliable one-to-one alignment under noise. The approach is supported by a theoretical analysis showing a stable negative-feedback mechanism that ensures convergence and robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluation on nine diverse TAG datasets shows ADAligner consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node classification, link prediction, and cross-modal retrieval. It demonstrates strong robustness to noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by approximately 2–3x compared with multimodal baselines, indicating scalability and reliability for real-world web data.

Conclusion: ADAligner provides a scalable, robust framework for graph-text representation learning in web-scale TAGs by adaptively balancing alignment expressivity with data quality. The dynamic reliability-aware mechanism yields stable convergence, better downstream performance, and faster pre-training, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

### [129] [CPSVD: Enhancing Large Language Model Compression via Column-Preserving Singular Value Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19385)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Li,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPSVD enhances SVD-based compression for LLMs by column-preserving decomposition: keep high-error columns, apply SVD to the rest, with adaptive layer/module-level rate allocation to meet a target compression, yielding better perplexity and zero-shot accuracy than existing SVD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVD-based compression treats all matrix entries uniformly, but decomposition errors vary across columns; this heterogeneity leads to suboptimal compression. The paper aims to exploit this structure to improve compression efficiency for large language models.

Method: 1) Identify columns with high decomposition error and preserve them directly. 2) Apply SVD only to columns with low error. 3) Determine the optimal trade-off point between preserving high-error columns and applying SVD. 4) Allocate non-uniform compression rates across modules within a layer to meet a target layer-wise compression ratio, exploiting cross-matrix heterogeneity.

Result: Empirical experiments show CPSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods, achieving lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy.

Conclusion: CPSVD provides a more accurate and flexible SVD-based compression framework for LLMs by error-aware column preservation and adaptive rate allocation, offering robust performance improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

### [130] [ARA: Adaptive Rank Allocation for Efficient Large Language Model SVD Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19389)
*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARA enables adaptive rank allocation for SVD-based LLM compression by coupling a dedicated mask design with an auxiliary loss to navigate non-smooth gain at compression ratio 1, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLaMA2-7B (80% compression): perplexity drop on WikiText2 and large gains in zero-shot accuracy versus uniform compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical problem of selecting appropriate ranks for different linear modules under a global compression constraint in SVD-based LLM compression. Prior methods rely on heuristic search or mask-based training but are limited by restricted exploration, inefficient spectral-parameter coupling, and the non-smooth gain at ratio 1 which can trap training in suboptimal minima.

Method: Introduce a dedicated mask design that maps retained ranks to trainable parameters, enabling efficient cross-module rank updates; add an auxiliary loss to guide parameter selection toward globally optimal solutions, mitigating non-smoothness issues and promoting better rank allocation under the global constraint.

Result: Experiment on LLaMA2-7B with 80% compression shows perplexity on WikiText2 reduced from 8.38 to 6.42, and average zero-shot task accuracy improved by 9.72 percentage points compared with uniform compression, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for SVD-based LLM compression.

Conclusion: ARA effectively solves the global rank allocation problem in SVD-based LLM compression by combining a tailored masking strategy with an auxiliary loss, achieving superior performance over existing heuristic and mask-based approaches and validating its practicality on a real model.

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

### [131] [FairNet: Dynamic Fairness Correction without Performance Loss via Contrastive Conditional LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19421)
*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet introduces dynamic, instance-level fairness correction by coupling a bias detector with a conditional LoRA module, activated only for biased instances, plus a contrastive loss to reduce intra-class disparities across sensitive groups. It handles complete/partial/absent sensitive attributes and aims to improve worst-group performance without hurting overall accuracy, with theoretical support and empirical validation across vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing debiasing methods often hurt overall performance, rely on static correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity in minority groups. They also rely too heavily on fully labeled sensitive attributes or ignore them altogether. There is a need for a flexible, data-efficient approach that can dynamically apply fairness corrections only when needed and accommodate varying availability of sensitive attributes.

Method: Propose FairNet: a framework that combines a bias detector with a conditional low-rank adaptation (LoRA) module. The bias detector identifies biased instances and triggers the LoRA-based fairness correction only for those instances, preserving unbiased instances’ performance. Introduce a novel contrastive loss for training LoRA to minimize intra-class representation disparities across sensitive groups and mitigate minority underfitting. The method supports complete, partial, or no sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis shows improvements on the worst group under moderate bias-detector performance (TPR/FPR) without reducing overall accuracy, potentially yielding small gains. Empirical evaluations on diverse vision and language benchmarks validate effectiveness.

Result: FairNet is reported to improve the worst-group performance without harming overall model performance, and may offer slight gains. The approach is validated across multiple vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating robustness to varying levels of sensitive attribute availability.

Conclusion: Dynamic, instance-level fairness correction via bias detection and conditional LoRA, coupled with a contrastive loss, provides a flexible and effective framework for fairness that works with varying availability of sensitive attributes and maintains strong overall performance, supported by theoretical guarantees and broad empirical validation.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

*Yulun Wu,Miguel Aguiar,Karl H. Johansson,Matthieu Barreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes IFeF-PINN, an iterative PINN training method using Random Fourier Features to overcome spectral bias; a two-stage approach with convex second-stage regression; proves convergence and demonstrates superior high-frequency PDE approximation on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs suffer from spectral bias and struggle to learn high-frequency components; enriching the latent space with Fourier features aims to alleviate this and improve accuracy for high-frequency PDEs.

Method: Introduce IFeF-PINN algorithm: augment the network with Random Fourier Features to create a Fourier-enhanced feature space; iteratively alternate between estimating a basis in the feature space and solving for the coefficients of the enhanced basis; for a linear model, the second stage is convex; prove convergence of the iterative scheme.

Result: Theoretical results show convexity and convergence of the second-stage regression; empirical results indicate enhanced expressive capacity and accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs; numerical benchmarks show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across the frequency spectrum.

Conclusion: Fourier-enhanced iterative training mitigates spectral bias in PINNs, providing convergence guarantees and improved accuracy for high-frequency problems; broad potential applicability to other PDEs and related modeling tasks.

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NVDPs: a Bayesian meta-learning method using task-specific dropout and a low-rank Bernoulli expert meta-model to efficiently adapt a shared neural network to new tasks in few-shot learning, with a task-wide prior for amortized variational inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robust conditional posterior inference in meta-learning to enable fast, reliable adaptation across tasks.

Method: Propose Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs) that model the conditional posterior with task-specific dropout; use a low-rank product of Bernoulli experts to map dropout rates from limited contexts; implement a prior conditioned on whole task data to optimize the conditional dropout posterior under amortized variational inference.

Result: Empirical evaluation across 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification shows superior or excellent performance compared with other meta-learning approaches.

Conclusion: NVDPs enable robust, memory-efficient Bayesian meta-learning with fast reconfiguration for new tasks, achieving strong performance across varied tasks.

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

*Julian Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A roadmap for safety via chain-of-thought monitoring in reasoning models, with a two-part safety case and a forecast-based viability plan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems approach dangerous capabilities, traditional inability-safety cases may be insufficient. CoT monitoring offers a potential path to improve control and trustworthiness by observing the model's reasoning process.

Method: Propose a two-part safety case: (1) models lack dangerous capabilities without CoT, (2) any dangerous capabilities enabled by CoT are detectable via CoT monitoring. Systematically analyze threats to monitorability (neuralese, encoded reasoning) across linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning; evaluate existing/novel CoT-faithfulness techniques; consider extracting a monitorable CoT from non-monitorable CoT; establish prediction markets to forecast key milestones for feasibility.

Result: A conceptual safety-case framework and research agenda: threat taxonomy, monitoring strategies, extraction possibilities, and a plan to evaluate viability using prediction-market forecasts.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring safety cases may enhance both control and trustworthiness safety, but success hinges on developing monitorable CoT or effective extraction; a prediction-market roadmap will help prioritize milestones for feasibility.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

### [135] [LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19422)
*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bootstrapping (BS) framework to counter the squeezing effect in unlearning for LLMs by jointly suppressing target responses and model beliefs; introduces BS-T (token) and BS-S (sequence) variants that achieve more thorough forgetting while preserving utility across model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning via gradient-based methods tends to redistribute probability mass into high-likelihood regions and model beliefs, causing spurious forgetting. Automated metrics can misreport success. A method that explicitly targets the model's own high-confidence beliefs could counteract this squeezing.

Method: Link the squeezing effect to the model's beliefs and integrate them into the unlearning objective. Propose two variants: BS-T (token-level) suppresses high-probability tokens; BS-S (sequence-level) suppresses high-confidence generations. Works across diverse model families and benchmarks, jointly reducing target responses and model beliefs.

Result: Experiments show BS yields stronger forgetting of targeted content compared to baselines and preserves utility. Both BS-T and BS-S contribute, with ablations confirming complementary effects. Framework demonstrates robustness across model sizes and datasets.

Conclusion: The BS framework offers a principled approach to thorough forgetting by countering the squeezing effect through joint suppression of targets and model beliefs, improving safety without severely harming utility. Future work may refine metrics and deployment considerations.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Qiang Chen,Zhongze Wu,Ang He,Xi Lin,Shuo Jiang,Shan You,Chang Xu,Yi Chen,Xiu Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INPO is an influence-aware optimization framework for graph unlearning that slows gradient divergence on forget sets and improves forget quality while preserving model utility, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph unlearning with gradient ascent on forget sets often causes rapid divergence and utility loss. There is a need to slow the divergence and make forgetting robust to the interplay between forget and retain sets.

Method: Propose INPO: an influence-aware negative propensity optimization framework. It uses an influence-aware message function to amplify the impact of unlearned edges, and a removal-based method to quickly estimate edge influence. It includes a topological entropy loss to limit excessive local-structure information loss. The paper also analyzes that unlearning high-influence edges can reduce unlearning impact (and suggests slower divergence for NPO).

Result: Empirical evaluation on five real-world datasets shows INPO achieves state-of-the-art forget quality metrics while maintaining model utility, with code released.

Conclusion: INPO slows divergence during graph unlearning, enhances robustness to the unlearning process, and delivers superior forget quality without sacrificing utility, supported by experiments and theoretical insights.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

*M. Klabunde,L. Caspari,F. Lemmerich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partial universality: high representational similarity can occur in some tasks, but predictive convergence with robustness is not universal and depends on the dataset; simple classifier retraining can align predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the generality of the modified universality hypothesis (Jones et al., 2022) that adversarially robust models for a given task are highly similar, across datasets and with respect to predictive behavior.

Method: Re-examine Jones et al.'s hypothesis, verify the main claim in specific settings, test across different datasets, analyze whether predictive behavior converges with increasing robustness, identify the source of divergent predictions, and assess whether retraining the classification layer can promote universal predictive behavior.

Result: High representational similarity is verified in specific settings, but results are inconsistent across datasets. Predictive behavior does not converge with increasing robustness, and differing predictions originate in the classification layer. Simple retraining of the classifiers can achieve more universal predictive behavior.

Conclusion: The findings suggest partial universality of neural networks in certain settings, while strict universality does not hold across datasets. Classifier retraining can induce more universal predictive patterns, but overall universality remains limited and context-dependent.

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

*Constance Ferragu,Jonathan D. Ziegler,Nicolas Deutschmann,Arthur Lindoulsi,Eli Bixby,Cradle ML Team*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: g-DPO: a scalable variant of Direct Preference Optimization for protein language models that prunes training pairs via sequence-space clustering and amortizes likelihoods with group-based methods, achieving 1.8–3.7x faster training while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) scales poorly due to a quadratic growth in the number of labeled training pairs with respect to dataset size, making training times prohibitive for sizable protein-design datasets. There is a need to maintain alignment performance while reducing computational cost.

Method: Introduce g-DPO which (1) applies sequence-space clustering to prune redundant training pairs without sacrificing signal, and (2) uses group-based approximations to amortize likelihood computations during training. Evaluated across three protein engineering tasks, comparing against standard DPO.

Result: g-DPO achieves performance in-silico and in-vitro that is statistically indistinguishable from standard DPO, while accelerating training by 1.8x to 3.7x. The speedups are expected to grow with larger datasets.

Conclusion: g-DPO provides a scalable and efficient approach to aligning protein language models with experimental design goals, maintaining performance while significantly reducing training time; benefits increase as dataset size grows.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

### [139] [From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19514)
*Maciej Mozolewski,Betül Bayrak,Kerstin Bach,Grzegorz J. Nalepa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prototype-driven, interpretable counterfactual framework for 12-lead ECG classification generates sparse, physiologically coherent explanations in under 1 second by combining SHAP-guided segment selection, DTW-based prototypes, and R-peak alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for explainable, actionable time-series explanations in clinical ECG diagnosis; existing models lack interpretable, sparse, and physiologically plausible explanations.

Method: 1) Use SHAP thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules; 2) Apply Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes; 3) Align prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample; 4) Generate counterfactuals that modify primarily 78% of the signal; 5) Evaluate three variants (Original, Sparse, Aligned Sparse) on 12-lead ECG classification across classes.

Result: The approach achieves 81.3% average validity across classes with 43% improvement in temporal stability; class-specific validity ranges from 98.9% for myocardial infarction (MI) to 13.2% for hypertrophy (HYP) detection; counterfactuals can be generated in under 1 second, and patients benefit from physiologically-aligned explanations; MI shows high validity while some conditions remain challenging.

Conclusion: The work establishes design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based ECG diagnosis and outlines pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment and interactive explanation platforms.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

*Ruiyao Miao,Junren Xiao,Shiya Tsang,Hui Xiong,Yingnian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes REBMBO, a Bayesian optimization framework that combines a Gaussian Process for local guidance with an Energy-Based Model for global structure, formulated as an MDP and optimized with PPO for adaptive multi-step lookahead, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BO suffers from one-step bias and local optima, especially in complex/high-dimensional tasks. The authors aim to improve global exploration and robustness by integrating an EBM with GP guidance and enabling multi-step lookahead.

Method: Define BO iterations as an MDP; use GP to provide local guidance; introduce an energy-based model to capture global structure; apply Proximal Policy Optimization to perform adaptive multi-step lookahead, adjusting exploration depth and direction dynamically.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show REBMBO outperforms traditional BO methods; results robust across various GP configurations, indicating adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: REBMBO effectively overcomes key BO limitations, blends local and global information through GP and EBM, and leverages reinforcement learning (PPO) for adaptive lookahead, yielding improved performance in costly objective functions.

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

*Markus Bujotzek,Evelyn Trautmann,Calum Hand,Ian Hales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated clustering methods are evaluated on distributed molecular data to assess dataset diversity and structure under privacy-preserving multi-institution training; results stress the importance of chemistry-informed metrics and explainability for effective federated diversity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable data-centric tasks (diversity estimation, data splitting, chemical space understanding) in pharmaceutical FL, addressing reliance on public datasets and privacy constraints.

Method: Benchmark three federated clustering methods (Fed-kMeans, Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans, Fed-LSH) against centralized baselines on eight molecular datasets; use standard metrics and introduce SF-ICF (chemistry-informed) for evaluation; perform explainability analyses on client side.

Result: Federated clustering can disentangle distributed molecular data; incorporating domain knowledge via chemistry-informed metrics and on-client explainability is crucial for valid diversity assessment in federated molecular data.

Conclusion: Chemistry-informed evaluation is essential in FL for molecular data; federated clustering holds promise for analyzing distributed chemical space, but domain-specific metrics and explainability are needed to realize its full utility.

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

### [142] [ELUTQ: Efficient LUT-Aware Quantization for Deploying Large Language Models on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19482)
*Xin Nie,Liang Dong,HaiCheng Zhang,JiaWang Xiao,G. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ) is a new, CPU-friendly quantization format that better models weight distributions without adding dequantization overhead, enabling efficient 3-bit and 2-bit quantization for edge LLMs and yielding notable perplexity and throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices have limited memory and compute; uniform quantization struggles at low bit widths due to dequantization overhead and poor fit to weight distributions, hindering on-device LLM deployment.

Method: Introduce HLQ, a quantization scheme that captures weight statistics with a hierarchical linear approach while keeping the cost of bit-serial LUT-based GEMM unchanged; orthogonal to existing quantization methods and integrable into various pipelines; provide optimized CPU inference kernels; support post-training quantization and efficient finetuning.

Result: For LLaMA3-8B, HLQ yields ~8% perplexity reduction at 3-bit and ~85% reduction at 2-bit under post-training quantization, with quantization completing in about one hour; efficient finetuning further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. The 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on Apple M2 (4 threads, batch=1).

Conclusion: HLQ offers a practical, hardware-friendly path to deployment of LLMs on CPU-based edge devices by reducing memory and latency while maintaining, or improving, model quality; it is compatible with existing quantization methods and pipelines and enables fast on-device inference.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

### [143] [Energy-Efficient and Dequantization-Free Q-LLMs: A Spiking Neural Network Approach to Salient Value Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19498)
*Chenyu Wang,Zhanglu Yan,Zhi Zhou,Xu Chen,Weng-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpikeQuant leverages brain-inspired spiking neural networks to enable dynamic mixed-precision quantization of activations by encoding salient values as binary spike counts, embedding the quantization scale into the IF threshold. This yields near-FP16 perplexity with W4A4 while significantly reducing energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-edge deployment of large language models is hindered by energy-hungry MAC operations, the overhead of dequantization, and the inefficiency of uniform bitwidths that waste salient information. Spiking neural networks offer binary spike representations and integrate-and-fire (IF) computation, which can support mixed-precision storage and energy-efficient processing. This motivates a quantization approach aligned with neuromorphic computation for LLMs.

Method: SpikeQuant selectively applies mixed-precision quantization to activations containing salient values and re-encodes them into binary spike counts, enabling dynamic storage of different bitwidths. It embeds the quantization scale into the IF threshold, allowing energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations without explicit dequantization.

Result: Experiments show SpikeQuant achieves near FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization and reduces energy cost by up to 4.6x compared with existing methods, demonstrating improved accuracy and energy efficiency for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: SpikeQuant demonstrates that brain-inspired mixed-precision encoding and embedded quantization scales within the IF mechanism can provide accurate and energy-efficient LLM inference, addressing core energy and dequantization challenges in edge deployments.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

*Demian Till,John Smeaton,Peter Haubrick,Gouse Saheb,Florian Graef,David Berman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Consortium consistency—ensembling responses from multiple LLMs—yields larger gains in hallucination detection and mitigation than single-model consistency, and can reduce inference costs when diverse models are used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push beyond single-model consistency methods by leveraging diverse data sources, training schemes, and architectures across multiple LLMs to better detect and mitigate hallucinations arising from biased or incomplete training data.

Method: Extend single-model consistency to a consortium of 15 LLMs from different teams. Evaluate performance gains in hallucination detection/mitigation and analyze under what conditions collaboration is beneficial, including cost considerations.

Result: Consortium consistency produced substantial improvements over single-model consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. Gains were observed across the participating model teams, and in many cases were accompanied by reduced inference costs, offsetting typical drawbacks of ensembling.

Conclusion: Team-based collaborations among heterogeneous LLMs (consortium consistency) are a promising direction for robust hallucination handling, offering performance benefits and potential cost savings when properly matched to model diversity and deployment constraints.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

*Shuli Zhang,Hao Zhou,Jiaqi Zheng,Guibin Jiang,Bing Cheng,Wei Lin,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-DFCL: a bi-level decision-focused causal learning framework that uses an unbiased, experimental-data–driven estimator for OR decision quality and jointly leverages observational and experimental data via implicit-differentiation, improving decision quality and addressing bias-variance in marketing pipelines; deployed at Meituan with strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve two core issues in online marketing: (1) the misalignment between ML prediction objectives and downstream optimization decisions, and (2) the bias-variance tradeoff caused by biased observational data and scarce unbiased experimental data.

Method: 1) derive an unbiased estimator of the OR decision quality using experimental data; 2) introduce surrogate loss functions to bridge discrete optimization gradients into ML training; 3) formulate a bi-level optimization that jointly leverages observational and experimental data and solve it via implicit differentiation.

Result: Demonstrates statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and large-scale online A/B tests; deployed at Meituan.

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL effectively addresses prediction-decision misalignment and the bias-variance dilemma, delivering improved decision quality and practical deployment potential in large-scale online platforms.

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TraDy introduces a memory-efficient transfer learning approach by dynamically sampling channels during training, exploiting architecture-aware layer importance, achieving high sparsity and substantial FLOP reduction while preserving strong downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large Deep Neural Networks under strict memory constraints during transfer learning; static channel pruning and fixed gradient approximations can degrade performance. The paper argues layer importance is architecture-dependent and can be determined beforehand, and that dynamic stochastic channel sampling yields better gradient estimates.

Method: Identify layer importance a priori; within preselected layers, apply dynamic stochastic channel selection that resamples channels between epochs; leverage two insights: architecture-dependent layer update importance and effective gradient approximation via dynamic channel sampling.

Result: TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks and architectures under memory constraints; demonstrates extreme sparsity and computational savings: up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative computation.

Conclusion: TraDy provides a practical, memory-efficient transfer-learning framework that maintains strong performance while enabling substantial gradient- and compute-savings through dynamic channel selection and architecture-aware updates; promising for scalable fine-tuning of large models.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict
resource constraints. We propose TraDy, a novel transfer learning scheme
leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative

*Waris Radji,Odalric-Ambrym Maillard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-based reinforcement learning approach for linear-quadratic control with unknown dynamics uses MED/Confusing Instance principles to develop MED-LQ, aiming for asymptotic optimality and scalability beyond small-scale settings, showing competitive performance in benchmarks and potential for large-scale MDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regret-minimization methods (e.g., optimism, Thompson sampling) face practical limitations in control with unknown dynamics and scalability. There is a need for principled, scalable algorithms that can leverage the LQR structure and ensure stability while performing well in large MDPs.

Method: Introduce MED-LQ by applying Confusing Instance (CI) and Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) principles to linear-quadratic control. Exploit LQR policy structure, sensitivity analysis, and stability considerations to derive an algorithmic framework that extends CI/MED beyond small-scale settings, with theoretical grounding and empirical benchmarks on a comprehensive control suite.

Result: MED-LQ achieves competitive performance across diverse scenarios in the control benchmarks, demonstrating the practicality and potential of CI/MED-based approaches for LQR with unknown dynamics and suggesting scalability to larger MDPs.

Conclusion: The work extends CI and MED principles to linear-quadratic control under unknown dynamics, yielding MED-LQ as a scalable, asymptotically grounded approach with strong empirical performance and broad potential for application in large-scale MDPs.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

TL;DR: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff: a diffusion/vae-based framework that uses distribution-alignment penalties to generate synthetic ICU time-series, enabling trustworthy evaluation of predictive models at population and subgroup levels while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable trustworthy, granular evaluation of medical AI using synthetic EHR data, addressing privacy concerns and the need to assess performance across diverse demographic subgroups.

Method: Augment TimeAutoDiff with distribution-alignment penalties; benchmark on MIMIC-III and eICU for 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks; evaluate real-on-synthetic (TRTS) and training-on-synthetic (TSTR); analyze 32 intersectional subgroups; compare against prior diffusion/VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff).

Result: TRTS gap reduced by >70%, achieving Δ_TRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC; TSTR gap ~0.01; large synthetic cohorts reduce subgroup AUROC estimation error by up to 50% relative to small real test sets; outperforms real small tests in 72–84% of subgroups.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, privacy-preserving framework for trustworthy, granular evaluation of medical AI in critical care, enabling robust performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, boosting trust in Medical AI.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ForecastNet-XCL is a deep learning ensemble for long-horizon RSV forecasting that uses climate- and time-based features with an autoregressive module to provide probabilistic forecasts up to 100 weeks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate endemic disease forecasting using ML, especially for RSV, across extended horizons and under limited surveillance, and climate affects RSV dynamics.

Method: An ensemble model ForecastNet-XCL combining XGBoost, CNN, and BiLSTM, with an autoregressive component trained on climate-controlled lagged relations; probabilistic inference; trained/tested on 34 US states; multi-week horizon up to 100 weeks.

Result: Outperforms statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensembles in within- and cross-state scenarios; preserves accuracy over long horizons; training on climatologically diverse data improves generalization, particularly for irregular/biennial patterns.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL is efficient, high-performing, and uncertainty-aware, suitable as a deployable early-warning tool under climate pressures and limited surveillance resources.

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: A training-free, architecture-agnostic diffusion-caching framework reduces inference compute by reusing computations across steps and layers, evolving from static reuse to dynamic prediction, and enabling compatibility with other speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models deliver high-quality generation but incur heavy multi-step computation and long latency; current acceleration methods face limited applicability, high training costs, or quality loss, motivating a training-free, architecture-agnostic solution.

Method: Systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of diffusion caching, proposes a unified framework for classification and analysis, and analyzes feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling to track the shift from static reuse to dynamic prediction, while highlighting integration with other acceleration techniques.

Result: Provides a comparative analysis of representative diffusion-caching methods, outlining a progression from static reuse to dynamic prediction and offering a unified perspective that enables combining caching with sampling optimization and model distillation for more efficient inference.

Conclusion: Diffusion caching is a promising, training-free paradigm that can enable real-time, efficient generative AI and may become a central component of future multimodal and interactive systems.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

TL;DR: DiffEvac uses diffusion models to learn evacuation heatmaps from layouts, enabling fast, scalable evacuation simulation for early design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the heavy parameterization of traditional evacuation models to enable rapid iterative design and safety optimization.

Method: Create a dataset of 399 diverse layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps; propose a decoupled feature representation to embed physical features (layouts, occupant density); train a diffusion model conditioned on image prompts to learn evacuation patterns from simulated heatmaps.

Result: Outperforms a Conditional GAN baseline with up to 37.6% higher SSIM and 142% higher PSNR; reduces simulation time by ~16x, delivering results in about 2 minutes; case studies show faster design iteration and new insights for safety optimization.

Conclusion: Lowers modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools for future safety optimization in intelligent building design.

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

*Hrittik Roy,Søren Hauberg,Nicholas Krämer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Least-squares is reframed as a differentiable linear-algebra primitive by deriving custom gradients that turn the LS solver into a differentiable operator, enabling it to function like a neural network layer and unlock diverse ML applications (sparsity on a large model, conservativeness constraints in score-based models, GP hyperparameter tuning).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The method of least squares has untapped potential in modern ML; making LS differentiable and pluggable as a layer can broaden the toolkit of differentiable linear-algebra methods for practitioners.

Method: Derives custom gradients to render the LS solver differentiable, effectively turning it into a neural-network-like layer. Demonstrates applications via three empirical evaluations: enforcing weight sparsity on a 50M-parameter model, imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based generative models, and hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based on predictive performance.

Result: Empirically validates the differentiable-LS approach across three domains, showing scalability (sparsity on a 50M-parameter model), improved constraints in generative models, and improved GP hyperparameter tuning, thereby extending differentiable linear-algebra tooling for ML.

Conclusion: The paper advances differentiable linear-algebra tooling by elevating least-squares to a differentiable operator, making it a practical, widely accessible component for ML practitioners and enabling a broader set of applications.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

*Shashi Kumar,Yacouba Kaloga,John Mitros,Petr Motlicek,Ina Kodrasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FVAE-LoRA introduces a factorized variational autoencoder within LoRA to separate task-relevant information from residual information in a low-rank space, yielding better performance and robustness across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA lacks an explicit mechanism to disentangle task-relevant features from other information in the learned low-rank subspace, which may limit transferability and robustness.

Method: Propose FVAE-LoRA: use a VAE to learn two latent spaces; an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) promotes factorization between spaces, dedicating one space to task-salient features and the other to residual information. Train across text, audio, and image tasks with spurious-correlation assessments.

Result: FVAE-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA across modalities and shows better isolation of task-relevant signals, leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Factorizing latent representations within LoRA via a VAE improves parameter-efficient fine-tuning by disentangling task-relevant information from residual noise, with demonstrated gains and robustness; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/idiap/FVAE-LoRA

### [154] [Overlap-weighted orthogonal meta-learner for treatment effect estimation over time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19643)
*Konstantin Hess,Dennis Frauen,Mihaela van der Schaar,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO) meta-learner for time-varying HTEs under low overlap; uses Neyman-orthogonal population risk; model-agnostic; demonstrated with Transformer and LSTM backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings suffers from severe overlap problems as horizon grows, causing high variance. Existing meta-learners assume adequate overlap and fail under low overlap.

Method: Introduce WO meta-learner that weights toward high-probability interventional sequences; develop Neyman-orthogonal population risk that minimizes overlap-weighted oracle risk; model-agnostic, compatible with any ML model; validated with Transformer and LSTM backbones.

Result: WO-learner yields more reliable HTE estimates under limited overlap; orthogonality provides robustness to nuisance function misspecification; empirical results show benefits with Transformer and LSTM backbones.

Conclusion: WO-learner offers a data-driven, robust approach to time-varying HTE in presence of overlap limitations, generalizable across models and potentially improving policy evaluation in sequential-treatment settings.

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

### [155] [Policy Learning with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672)
*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Abstention-enabled policy learning with a two-stage learner and regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes settings, abstaining from risky decisions can improve safety; there is a need for better guarantees when predictions are uncertain and when data shifts occur.

Method: A two-stage learner: first identify a set of near-optimal policies; then construct an abstention rule from their disagreements. Regret guarantees are fast O(1/n) when propensities are known, extended to unknown propensities via a doubly robust objective.

Result: Fast O(1/n) regret guarantees in the known-propensity setting; extension to unknown propensities via doubly robust objective; abstention yields improved guarantees under margin conditions without realizability, and connects to distributionally robust policy learning and safe policy improvement.

Conclusion: Abstention is a versatile tool in policy learning, enabling safety, robustness, and improved guarantees across high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

### [156] [Fast Inference via Hierarchical Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19705)
*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) stacks multiple draft models to verify tokens in a single forward pass, reducing autoregressive generation latency beyond single-draft approaches while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference latency of transformer language models by leveraging a spectrum of draft models, from fast/less accurate to slower/more reliable, and optimally orchestrating them to verify tokens.

Method: Propose HSD: place draft models in a hierarchy where each model proposes tokens and the next larger model verifies them in one forward pass, until the target model verifies the final tokens. Derive an expression for the expected latency of any hierarchy and show that the latency-optimal hierarchy can be found in polynomial time.

Result: Theoretical latency model for hierarchies; polynomial-time method to select the optimal hierarchy; empirical results show up to 1.2x speed-up over the best single-draft baseline while maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: HSD is a practical approach to reduce generation latency by structured use of draft models; it outperforms single-draft schemes and provides a tractable way to optimize hierarchy selection.

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

### [157] [SEMPO: Lightweight Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19710)
*Hui He,Kun Yi,Yuanchi Ma,Qi Zhang,Zhendong Niu,Guansong Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO is a lightweight time-series foundation model that achieves strong general forecasting with reduced pretraining data and model size, thanks to an energy-aware spectral decomposition module and a mixture-of-prompts transformer; it excels in zero-shot and few-shot settings across 16 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a trade-off between the versatility of large time-series foundation models and their resource demands. The authors aim to enable strong generalization with smaller-scale data and lighter architectures suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: SE MPO combines two components: (1) an energy-aware spectral decomposition module that models both high-energy and low-energy informative frequency signals; (2) a Mixture-of-Prompts enabled Transformer that uses small dataset-specific prompts and routes time-series tokens to prompt-based experts to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation across datasets and domains.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two large-scale benchmarks spanning 16 datasets shows SEMPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot and few-shot forecasting, while substantially reducing pretraining data requirements and model size.

Conclusion: SEMPO demonstrates that a light, information-rich spectral representation combined with prompt-based adaptation can deliver strong general time-series forecasting with resource efficiency; code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

### [158] [Statistical Inference for Linear Functionals of Online Least-squares SGD when $t \gtrsim d^{1+δ}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19734)
*Bhavya Agrawalla,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Promit Ghosal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-asymptotic Berry–Esseen bounds are established for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD, proving a Gaussian CLT in growing dimensions. A CLT holds when iterations grow as t ~ d^{1+δ}, enabling an online, data-driven confidence interval framework with O(td) time and O(d) memory, plus an online variance estimator with high-probability deviation bounds, outperforming covariance-inversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for SGD in high-dimensional, online settings is essential for reliability in data science and ML. Existing high-dimensional inference methods rely on covariance inversion and require many iterations (t ≳ d^{3/2}), which is computationally expensive. There is a need for fully online, scalable, data-driven confidence intervals for SGD iterates.

Method: Derive non-asymptotic Berry–Esseen bounds for linear functionals of online least-squares SGD. Show a Gaussian CLT in a growing-dimensional regime with t ≥ d^{1+δ} for any δ>0. Develop an online variance estimator for the asymptotic variance and establish high-probability deviation bounds. Analyze computational complexity to show O(td) time and O(d) memory. Provide a framework for constructing confidence intervals online.

Result: A CLT holds for SGD iterates in the near-optimal regime t ≳ d^{1+δ}. The online procedure runs in O(td) time and uses O(d) memory. An online variance estimator with high-probability deviation bounds is developed, delivering the first fully online, data-driven confidence interval framework for SGD in this scaling regime.

Conclusion: This work significantly extends feasible dimensionality for online inference with SGD, reducing computational burden relative to covariance-inversion methods and enabling practical, fully online confidence intervals in high dimensions.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

*Catherine Villeneuve,Benjamin Akera,Mélisande Teng,David Rolnick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian deep learning for species distribution models (SDMs) using BATIS, an iterative prior-posterior updating framework to handle data scarcity and uncertainty, improving reliability in data-poor locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases and uncertainty in deep SDMs by integrating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, balancing fine-grained local insights with broad ecological patterns, especially in data-scarce regions to support conservation.

Method: Introduce BATIS, a practical Bayesian framework where prior predictions are updated iteratively with limited observational data; compare and benchmark a range of uncertainty quantification methods on a novel dataset including citizen science (eBird) observations.

Result: Bayesian deep learning approaches can substantially improve the reliability and calibration of SDMs in data-scarce locations, demonstrating gains in predictive trustworthiness and usefulness for ecological understanding and conservation.

Conclusion: BATIS provides a practical approach for updating SDMs with limited data using Bayesian updating, enabling better uncertainty handling and more reliable species distribution predictions in data-poor settings.

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

### [160] [When Do Transformers Learn Heuristics for Graph Connectivity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19753)
*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers' ability to learn general graph algorithms hinges on model capacity and training data. A simplified disentangled Transformer can compute adjacency-mow powers for graphs with diameter up to 3^L, revealing a capacity-driven transition: within-capacity graphs yield the correct algorithm; beyond capacity, the model defaults to a degree-based heuristic. Limiting training data to a model's capacity leads to exact algorithm learning in both standard and disentangled variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why neural transformers struggle to learn generalizable algorithms and how architectural capacity and training data shape algorithmic learning, using graph connectivity as a testbed.

Method: Theoretically analyze a simplified disentangled Transformer to prove a capacity bound: an L-layer model can solve graphs with diameters up to 3^L by implementing powers of the adjacency matrix. Study training dynamics to show that learned strategies depend on whether training graphs fit within this capacity. Empirically compare standard and disentangled transformers under controlled data regimes that are within vs beyond capacity.

Result: We establish an exact diameter-capacity bound: graphs with diameter ≤ 3^L are solvable by the model via adjacency-matrix powers. When training data lies within this capacity, models learn the correct algorithm; when data exceed capacity, they default to a simple degree-based heuristic. Empirical experiments confirm that restricting training data to the model’s capacity leads both architectures to learn the exact algorithm rather than the heuristic.

Conclusion: Model capacity actively shapes the algorithm that neural transformers learn. Controlling training data to lie within a model’s capacity enables the discovery of the correct algorithm for graph tasks, while exceeding capacity induces brittle heuristics such as degree-based shortcuts. This aligns theory with empirically observed generalization behavior in both standard and disentangled transformers.

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

*Aman Bilkhoo,Milad Kazemi,Nicola Paoletti,Mehran Hosseini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CONFEX, an uncertainty-aware method for counterfactual explanations using Conformal Prediction and MILP with local coverage guarantees via local CP and offline tree partitioning, ensuring robustness and optimality of explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) must be reliable and avoid regions of high predictive uncertainty; existing methods often ignore uncertainty or lack principled guarantees, hindering actionable recourse and interpretability.

Method: A hybrid framework combining local Conformal Prediction (for uncertainty guarantees) with MILP-based generation of counterfactuals, aided by offline tree-based input-space partitioning to enable efficient MILP encoding and localised CP to address exchangeability issues.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse benchmarks shows uncertainty-aware explanations are more robust and plausible, with rigorous guarantees on predictive uncertainty and optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on relevant metrics.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware CFXs via CONFEX offer principled guarantees and practical effectiveness by fusing CP with MILP, enabling robust, actionable explanations with formal uncertainty control.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

### [162] [The Tail Tells All: Estimating Model-Level Membership Inference Vulnerability Without Reference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19773)
*Euodia Dodd,Nataša Krčo,Igor Shilov,Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a reference-model-free estimator of model-level MIA vulnerability using loss distributions and the TPR at low FPR; it outperforms existing low-cost and distribution-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIAs are used to assess privacy risk in AI models, but state-of-the-art attacks require many costly reference models. A scalable, model-level vulnerability estimator is needed for practical evaluation.

Method: Observes that training/testing loss distributions are asymmetric and heavy-tailed; after training, risky points shift from the high-loss tail toward the head. Proposes using the absence of high-loss outliers as a predictor of risk and employs the TNR of a simple loss-based attack as a proxy for model-level vulnerability to LiRA. Evaluated across architectures and datasets, compared against LiRA, RMIA, and distribution-difference measures; explores nonlinear risk functions to extend to large language models.

Result: The TNR of a simple loss-based attack accurately estimates model-level vulnerability to LiRA, outperforming RMIA and other distribution-based baselines across diverse settings. Nonlinear risk evaluations show promise for application to large language models.

Conclusion: A practical, reference-model-free metric can effectively approximate model-level MIA risk, enabling scalable privacy evaluation across diverse models and datasets, with potential extensions to nonlinear risk assessments in large-scale models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a gradient-guided sparse fine-tuning method that selects top-gradient, low-magnitude parameters for updating, achieving strong ID/OD performance and reduced forgetting compared with LoRA/DoRA/SAFT on Llama3-8B and Gemma-2B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sparse fine-tuning by prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant but minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge, addressing instability and forgetting in existing PEFT methods.

Method: Identify and fine-tune a sparse subset of parameters that have the largest downstream-task gradient magnitudes and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes; apply this selection to LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B; compare performance against leading PEFT methods (LoRA, DoRA, SAFT) on ID and OOD data and across random seeds.

Result: GaLLoP consistently matches or outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks; it mitigates catastrophic forgetting and memorization by keeping important pre-trained weights intact and yields more stable performance across seeds.

Conclusion: Gradient-based sparse selection of high-gradient, low-magnitude parameters yields robust, efficient sparse fine-tuning that preserves pre-trained knowledge while achieving strong generalization, offering competitive or superior performance relative to current PEFT methods.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: IID data assumptions hinder generalization across environmental shifts. Environment labels are often unavailable due to data collection, privacy, and variability, motivating a method to infer environments directly from data.

Method: DynaInfer analyzes per-round prediction errors of fixed neural networks to deduce environment specifications, then solves a joint alternating optimization for environment assignment and model training in unlabeled scenarios; performance improves as true labels converge.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse dynamical systems show DynaInfer outperforms existing environment-assignment methods, converges rapidly to true labels, and can surpass models trained with true environment labels.

Conclusion: Inferring environment structure from prediction errors enables robust, label-free generalization in dynamical-system learning, with strong empirical results and faster convergence.

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

### [165] [Blackbox Model Provenance via Palimpsestic Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19796)
*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An independence-testing framework to detect whether a black-box derivative of an open-weight LM uses Alice’s training data, employing palimpsestic memorization; it examines both a query-based setting and an observational setting to establish provenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provenance and verifiability of model usage: can Alice prove that Bob’s model or text depends on her training run? The paper formalizes this as testing independence between Bob and Alice’s data and shows memorization patterns (data order) provide statistical evidence.

Method: Query setting: prompt-based estimation of Bob’s likelihood on Alice’s training examples and their order; across 40 fine-tunes (1B–12B) of Pythia/OLMo models, correlations with training-order yield p-values ~1e-8 in most cases. Observational setting: (1) likelihood of Bob’s text overlapping with Alice’s training spans; (2) likelihood of Bob’s text given different retrained versions of Alice’s model obtained by repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) on reshuffled data. The latter distinguishes Bob’s text from a few hundred tokens; the former needs hundreds of thousands of tokens for high power.

Result: Query-based evidence shows strong correlation between Bob’s model outputs and the training-data order, with very small p-values in most experiments; observational methods can reliably identify Bob’s data usage with a small amount of retraining data (second approach) but may require substantial text for the first approach.

Conclusion: Independence testing anchored in palimpsestic memorization provides a quantifiable framework to certify whether a black-box derivative uses a given training set. The two observational/ query methods have complementary data requirements and offer practical paths to proving model provenance under data-order memorization effects.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [166] [Transformers are almost optimal metalearners for linear classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19797)
*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simplified transformer trained with gradient descent can act as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting, requiring only O(k / R^4) in-context examples on a new task, independent of ambient dimension d, and outperforming learners that rely solely on in-context data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally analyze whether transformers can function as metalearners within the meta-learning framework and to quantify the sample complexity benefits of in-context learning when the tasks share a low-dimensional subspace.

Method: Analyze a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent on a family of tasks where each task is a class-conditional Gaussian mixture with means lying in a shared k-dimensional subspace of R^d. After sufficient task exposure, prove that the transformer can generalize to a new task using O(k / R^4) in-context examples, approaching the performance of an oracle learner that knows the subspace, and far better than any learner that only sees in-context data (needs Omega(d / R^4) examples). Importantly, the bounds do not depend on the ambient dimension d.

Result: Theoretical demonstration that gradient-descent-trained transformer can serve as a near-optimal metalearner under the stated model. The required number of in-context examples to generalize to a new task scales with k and the signal strength R, not with the ambient dimension d, and is close to the optimal learner that knows the shared subspace; standard baselines restricted to in-context data perform much worse.

Conclusion: The work establishes a theoretical bridge between transformer-based ICL and meta-learning, showing that, in a linear Gaussian mixture setting with a shared subspace structure, a trained transformer can efficiently meta-learn across tasks. It also highlights directions for extending analysis to more general (nonlinear) tasks and finite training-task requirements.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

*Sandra Malagon,Monica A. Ulloa Ruiz,Tatiana Elizabeth Sandoval Plaza,Gabriel Rafael Rosario Bolívar,Valentina García Mesa,Ivanna Alvarado Morales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feasibility study of sovereign-scale LLM training in Brazil and Mexico under constrained hardware, energy, and fiscal ceilings; H100-based training appears viable at $8-14M, A100 at $19-32M; extended training timelines can mitigate hardware limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore AI compute governance and technological sovereignty for middle-income countries by evaluating whether Brazil and Mexico can develop auditable, locally aligned LLMs within infrastructure and budget constraints.

Method: Dual-axis design varying accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150 days); model scope ~10-trillion tokens; assess compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures, and regulatory compatibility under export-control and electrical infrastructure thresholds.

Result: H100-based configurations are economically feasible (total cost 8-14M USD); A100 configurations are more costly (19-32M USD) due to higher energy and hardware needs; all configurations stay within export-control and electrical thresholds; extending training timelines can alleviate hardware constraints.

Conclusion: Mid-income countries can establish sustainable, strategically aligned AI capabilities through context-sensitive strategies; contributes to AI compute governance and sovereignty discourse.

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Debabrota Basu,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A transport-based framework reveals three regimes of sub-optimality vs coverage in verifiable test-time scaling, with insights into sequential vs batched sampling and empirical validation on Qwen, Llama, Gemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how verifier imperfections interact with generator coverage and sampling cost in test-time scaling, providing a unified, quantitative framework for their geometry.

Method: Frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem; derive the sub-optimality–coverage curve with three regimes (transport, policy-improvement, saturation); analyze sequential and batched sampling and their computational trade-offs; validate theory empirically on Qwen, Llama, and Gemma.

Result: The framework identifies three regimes—transport, policy-improvement, and saturation—and shows how verifier ROC and sub-optimality shape outcomes; sampling class affects trade-offs; empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: The transport perspective clarifies when verification helps and how to balance coverage, verifier convergence, and sampling; it offers design guidance for verifiable test-time scaling and applies across diverse LLM families.

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

### [169] [Timely Clinical Diagnosis through Active Test Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18988)
*Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACTMED merges Bayesian Experimental Design with large language models to adaptively select diagnostic tests, using LLMs to simulate patient states for belief updates, enabling clinician-in-the-loop decision support. It aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource efficiency while reducing reliance on domain-specific labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for sequential, resource-aware diagnostic reasoning that reflects real-world clinical workflows. Traditional ML approaches often rely on static, fully observed datasets and may not capture the dynamic, cost-sensitive, and clinician-guided nature of diagnosis, particularly in high-pressure or resource-limited settings.

Method: ACTMED uses Bayesian Experimental Design to choose the next diagnostic test that most reduces diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. Large language models serve as flexible simulators to generate plausible patient state distributions and support belief updates without task-specific training data. Clinicians remain in the loop to review test suggestions and interpret outputs, integrating clinical judgment.

Result: Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that ACTMED can optimize test selection to improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use, demonstrating potential for improved, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: ACTMED represents a step toward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned diagnostic systems that can generalize across settings with reduced reliance on domain-specific data.

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

### [170] [Rectifying Shortcut Behaviors in Preference-based Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19050)
*Wenqian Ye,Guangtao Zheng,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM mitigates shortcut-based reward hacking in preference-based RLHF by learning group-invariant kernels within a closed-form objective, improving out-of-distribution reward accuracy and reducing shortcut reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking via shortcuts leads to over-optimization and poor generalization in preference-based reward models; a broad, invariant-based framework is needed to prevent exploiting spurious cues across diverse tasks.

Method: PRISM (Preference-based Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation) learns group-invariant kernels with feature maps using invariant theory in the kernel perspective, framed in a closed-form objective to enforce invariance to shortcut features.

Result: Empirical results across benchmarks show improved reward model accuracy on out-of-distribution tasks and reduced reliance on shortcuts in downstream policy models, indicating more robust preference-based alignment.

Conclusion: PRISM offers a principled, flexible framework for mitigation of shortcut behaviors in preference-based alignment, enhancing generalization and robustness against reward hacking.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

*Brandon James Carone,Iran R. Roman,Pablo Ripollés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces MUSE, an open-source 10-task benchmark for assessing core music perception and relational reasoning in Multimodal LLMs. It evaluates four state-of-the-art models against a human baseline, revealing large performance gaps and reliability issues, with Chain-of-Thought prompting often harming results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose fundamental weaknesses in music-understanding capabilities of current multimodal LLMs, particularly in relational reasoning and invariant musical representation, and to provide a standardized evaluation tool.

Method: Design of a 10-task benchmark (MUSE) focused on core music perception skills; evaluation of four SOTA models (Gemini Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, Audio-Flamingo 3) against a human baseline (N=200); analysis of performance with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: Wide variance in SOTA capabilities; Gemini Pro handles basic perception, while Qwen and Audio-Flamingo 3 perform near chance; perceptual deficits are severe; CoT prompting is inconsistent or detrimental; the benchmark reveals persistent gap to human experts.

Conclusion: MUSE provides a critical, open-source tool for evaluating invariant musical representations in LLMs and guiding the development of more robust systems with improved musical understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show differing CONSORT-item handling and reasoning styles across models and prompts, exposing limitations for clinical trial compliance automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how LLMs reason about CONSORT reporting to assess reliability, explainability, and cognitive strategies in medical AI.

Method: Behavioral and metacognitive analysis with expert-validated data; compare two representative LLMs under three prompt conditions; analyze reasoning style, uncertainty, and interpretations.

Result: Models differ in addressing CONSORT items; prompt type influences reasoning style, uncertainty expression, and alternative interpretations; patterns reveal strategic behavior rather than stable compliance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in clinical compliance automation; better understanding of cognitive adaptations is needed to develop more explainable and reliable medical AI.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

### [173] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Mode Selection, a harder variant of Early Exit that decides at the start whether to use Long-CoT or Short-CoT (zero-step thinking) and determines an optimal stopping point during reasoning to reduce compute. Evaluates nine baselines and finds prompts struggle with minimal information, while internal-information-based approaches are more robust but still unstable; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational overhead of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models without sacrificing performance, by making an upfront mode decision (Long vs Short CoT) and optimizing early stopping with zero-step thinking.

Method: Define Mode Selection as the prior decision to choose between Thinking (Long-CoT) and NoThinking (Short-CoT) at the reasoning start, using zero-step thinking. Compare it to Early Exit, which stops reasoning at an inferred point. Conduct empirical studies on nine baselines, contrasting prompt-based methods (relying on superficial signals) against approaches that leverage internal model information, and assess stability across scenarios. Provide code at the project repository.

Result: Prompt-based methods exhibit limited classification capability with minimal handcrafted information and often fail. Approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across most scenarios but suffer from stability issues. Overall, existing information-only methods are insufficient for effective Mode Selection in information-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Mode Selection presents a more challenging variant of Early Exit requiring information beyond surface prompts. Robust solutions must go beyond model-provided signals, possibly incorporating internal representations or alternative cues to achieve reliable mode decisions under limited information. The authors release their code to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

*Yaoyao Qian,Yuanli Wang,Jinda Zhang,Yun Zong,Meixu Chen,Hanhan Zhou,Jindan Huang,Yifan Zeng,Xinyu Hu,Chan Hee Song,Danqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based framework, WebGraphEval, converts multi-agent trajectories into a unified weighted action graph, enabling multi-path, efficiency-aware evaluation and revealing insights beyond binary success metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation often uses binary success or a single reference trajectory, ignoring structural diversity across benchmarks; a representation that captures varying decision paths and efficiency is needed.

Method: Construct a unified weighted action graph from trajectories across agents; canonicalize actions, merge recurring behaviors; perform structural analyses like reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics; leverage benchmarks such as WebArena without modifying environments.

Result: On thousands of trajectories from six web agents, the graph abstraction reveals cross-model regularities, exposes redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics.

Conclusion: Framing web interaction as graph-structured data provides a general, efficiency-aware methodology for evaluating multi-path, cross-agent behaviors; WebGraphEval integrates with existing benchmarks for richer evaluation.

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

*Marianna Molinari,Ilaria Angela Amantea,Marinella Quaranta,Guido Governatori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatGPT struggles to deliver an exhaustive, integrated legal analysis; a regex-based baseline can match certain extraction tasks, revealing a limitation in AI's ability to reason across multiple competencies in law; human-like unified understanding remains superior in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the practical capabilities and limits of ChatGPT in a high-stakes, specialized domain (law) and compare its performance against a rule-based baseline to understand whether AI can assemble knowledge and reasoning into a comprehensive legal output.

Method: An experimental comparison where ChatGPT is used to read legal decisions and extract key passages condensed from principles of law (PoLs), with a regex-based baseline as a control. Evaluation focuses on the AI's ability to assemble knowledge, reason, and produce an exhaustive, unified result across multiple legal competencies.

Result: Even with access to the necessary knowledge and competencies, ChatGPT could not assemble them into reasoning that yields an exhaustive, unified result. This highlights a major limitation: AI lacks the all-encompassing understanding and integrated reasoning required for high-quality legal analysis. Genuine intelligence, at least in this field, appears to remain a uniquely human trait.

Conclusion: The study suggests fundamental limitations of current AI for complex, multi-competence legal tasks. Relying on AI alone for comprehensive legal analysis is insufficient; human expertise is essential, particularly for reading decisions and extracting principles of law to inform rulings and legal documents.

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

*Wachara Fungwacharakorn,Gauvain Bourgne,Ken Satoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes extending Derivation State Argumentation (DSA) framework to explain reasoning under a generalized reason model that allows inconsistent precedents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precedential constraint underpins case-based reasoning; enforcing consistency is strong and may be unrealistic; need explanation methods for generalized models accommodating inconsistency in precedents.

Method: Develop extension of DSA-framework to support explanations consistent with generalized reason model; define semantics and argumentation constructs; illustrate with formal properties (likely).

Result: Provides a theoretical extension enabling argumentative explanations for generalized reasoning with inconsistent precedents; groundwork for explanation methods in AI & Law with inconsistent data.

Conclusion: The extended DSA-framework closes the gap by enabling explanations under the generalized reason model; prompts further work on implementation, evaluation, and integration into legal reasoning tools.

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

Motivation: To determine whether LLM agents can reproduce human online social dynamics shaped by homophily, reciprocity, and validation, and to uncover memory/learning mechanisms that enable such dynamics.

Method: A multi-agent LLM simulation where agents repeatedly interact, evaluate each other, and adapt via in-context learning augmented by a coaching signal. Behavioral reward functions model online engagement drivers (interaction, information seeking, self-presentation, coordination, emotional support) to align objectives with real user motivations.

Result: Coached LLM agents develop stable interaction patterns and emergent social ties, producing network structures with properties similar to real online communities.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled testbed for studying collective dynamics in LLM populations and helps assess how artificial agents approximate or diverge from human-like social behavior.

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

### [178] [Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19314)
*Jinwu Hu,Zihao Lian,Zhiquan Wen,Chenghao Li,Guohao Chen,Xutao Wen,Bin Xiao,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CKA-RL introduces continual knowledge adaptation and adaptive knowledge merging for reinforcement learning, enabling accumulation and reuse of historical task knowledge to mitigate forgetting and improve transfer. It uses a task-specific knowledge vector pool with dynamic usage and merges similar vectors to save memory. Empirical results on three benchmarks show improvements over state-of-the-art (4.20% overall, 8.02% forward transfer); code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL is non-stationary and multi-task; continual RL often suffers catastrophic forgetting and inefficient knowledge reuse. There is a need to accumulate, preserve, and adapt historical knowledge to rapidly adapt to new tasks.

Method: Maintain a task-specific knowledge vector pool and dynamically utilize historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks; preserve and adapt critical model parameters to mitigate forgetting; introduce adaptive knowledge merging to combine similar knowledge vectors, reducing memory while preserving essential information.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three benchmarks shows the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with about 4.20% improvement in overall performance and 8.02% in forward transfer.

Conclusion: CKA-RL effectively mitigates forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer via structured knowledge pools and adaptive merging, offering scalable memory usage. The approach demonstrates strong empirical gains and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench is a scalable benchmark for evaluating multi-hop tool orchestration by LLMs within a hierarchical Model-Context Protocol (MCP) system, using equal-function ground truth, a five-level curriculum, and objective metrics; it reveals robustness and hierarchy-related weaknesses and offers a diagnostic framework and public resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks evaluate tools in isolation and overlook cross-server orchestration and overlapping functions, leading to overly optimistic assessments.

Method: Construct ground truth via 'equal function sets' to enable objective metrics (e.g., F1); organize tasks in a five-level curriculum from single-tool orchestration to complex cross-server planning; test robustness to out-of-scope requests within a hierarchical MCP ecosystem.

Result: Experiments indicate rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without co-designed strategies; state-of-the-art agents show systemic weaknesses in robustness; MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose limitations and guide development of more capable tool-using agents.

Conclusion: MSC-Bench offers a diagnostic framework and publicly available resources to drive development of more capable tool-using agents; benchmark and resources are available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr compiles symbolic plans into neurosymbolic procedural representations to enable fast, LM-based embodied reasoning without external planners, suitable for latency- and resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied tasks in dynamic environments struggle with latency and resource limits when relying on large inference engines or external planners; there is a need for efficient, self-contained reasoning that can operate with compact LMs.

Method: Generate task-specific plans with a symbolic tool, then transform those plans into composable procedural representations that encode their production rules. These procedures are integrated into the LM's inference, enabling single-step LM reasoning that captures multi-step planning.

Result: NeSyPr demonstrates efficient reasoning over large-scale reasoning models and a symbolic planner using more compact LMs on embodied benchmarks (PDDLGym, VirtualHome, ALFWorld).

Conclusion: NeSyPr provides a neurosymbolic proceduralization approach that makes LM-based agents capable of adaptive, timely planning in latency-constrained embodied settings without continuous reliance on external symbolic guidance.

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

### [181] [DAIL: Beyond Task Ambiguity for Language-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19562)
*Runpeng Xie,Quanwei Wang,Hao Hu,Zherui Zhou,Ni Mu,Xiyun Li,Yiqin Yang,Shuang Xu,Qianchuan Zhao,Bo XU*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL introduces Distributional Aligned Learning to mitigate instruction ambiguity in language-conditioned tasks by combining a distributional policy with semantic alignment, yielding superior results on structured and visual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language instructions are flexible and ambiguous, causing degraded performance in language-conditioned tasks. A method is needed to align trajectories with instructions and to make learning robust to instruction variation.

Method: DAIL consists of two components: a distributional policy that models value distributions to improve task differentiability, and a semantic alignment module that links trajectories to corresponding linguistic instructions. The paper provides theoretical results on differentiability and demonstrates alignment between trajectories and instructions.

Result: Empirical results on structured and visual benchmarks show DAIL outperforms baselines and resolves instruction ambiguities.

Conclusion: DAIL effectively reduces instruction ambiguity in language-conditioned tasks via distributional estimation and semantic alignment, with theoretical support and strong empirical gains; code released.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

### [182] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A realistic benchmark (HSCodeComp) evaluates deep search agents on hierarchical, rule-based reasoning to assign 10-digit HS Codes, revealing a large gap to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks underevaluate the ability to apply vague, hierarchical rules (legal/medical/tariff) in real-world tasks. Evaluating such rule-grounded reasoning is essential for trustworthy, practical AI in domains with explicit taxonomies and regulatory constraints.

Method: HSCodeComp is built from real-world e-commerce data (632 products) with expert-annotated 10-digit HS Codes. It requires agents to follow hierarchical rules to map noisy product descriptions to precise HS Codes. The dataset spans diverse categories and includes multiple expert annotations to capture ambiguity. The evaluation includes state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source, and closed-source agents.

Result: Best-performing agent achieves 46.8% accuracy on 10-digit HS Codes, far from human experts at 95.0% accuracy. Hierarchical rule application is the core difficulty; increasing test-time computation does not meaningfully close the gap.

Conclusion: HSCodeComp exposes a large discrepancy between current AI agents and human experts in rule-grounded, hierarchical reasoning for structured classification. The benchmark provides a platform to study and improve rule-aware deep search agents and motivates methods that better handle vague boundaries and implicit logic.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

### [183] [AgentSense: LLMs Empower Generalizable and Explainable Web-Based Participatory Urban Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19661)
*Xusen Guo,Mingxing Peng,Xixuan Hao,Xingchen Zou,Qiongyan Wang,Sijie Ruan,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense is a training-free, multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs into participatory urban sensing to achieve adaptive, explainable sensing and outperform traditional and single-agent baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web-based participatory sensing struggles with generalization across diverse urban contexts and lacks transparency in decision-making; there is a need for adaptive, explainable, and robust sensing systems.

Method: Hybrid approach: classical planner to generate baseline task allocations, followed by iterative refinement to adapt to dynamic urban conditions and worker preferences; multi-agent evolution; LLM-generated natural language explanations; training-free.

Result: Experiments on two large mobility datasets and seven dynamic disturbances show improved adaptivity and explainability vs traditional methods; outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in performance and robustness with transparent explanations.

Conclusion: AgentSense represents a meaningful step toward deployable, adaptive and explainable urban sensing on the web, with improved generalization and trust.

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

### [184] [A Graph Engine for Guitar Chord-Tone Soloing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19666)
*Matthew Keating,Michael Casey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-based optimization for chord-tone soloing on guitar; uses chord-tone arpeggio nodes and shortest-path search to assemble a solo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chord-tone soloing is fundamental but difficult for guitar students; there is a need for a systematic, computational aid to generate guided solos that stay within the current chord tones.

Method: Generate chord-tone arpeggios for each chord; construct a weighted graph where nodes are arpeggios; set edge weights based on optimal transition tones between consecutive chords; compute the shortest path through the graph; reconstruct the resulting chord-tone solo; design a user-friendly interface for input/output to support practice.

Result: Proposes a graph-based engine that outputs a chord-tone soloing line by solving a shortest-path problem; provides a feasible framework for teaching and practicing chord-tone soloing.

Conclusion: A graph-based approach offers a viable, systematic method to assist guitar students in practicing chord-tone soloing, with potential educational tooling and guided generate-and-practice workflows.

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

*Silvia García-Méndez,Francisco de Arriba-Pérez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Explainable streaming win-prediction for e-sports using sliding windows; achieves >90% accuracy and outperforms baselines, with an explainability module to support decision-making and ranking/recommendation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing e-sports audience and participants demand real-time, interpretable analytics. Traditional AI work focuses on batch classification and lacks visualization, underscoring the need for streaming, explainable solutions that reflect game-state changes.

Method: A streaming classification framework that processes input data across sliding windows to capture relevant game changes. Incorporates an explainability module to provide interpretable predictions and supports downstream ranking/recommendation tasks.

Result: Accuracy reported above 90%, outperforming competing solutions in the literature. The explainability module enhances trust and enables informed decisions for stakeholders.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers real-time, explainable win predictions in e-sports, with potential integration into ranking and recommender systems to improve decision-making and trust in predictions.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

### [186] [RLIE: Rule Generation with Logistic Regression, Iterative Refinement, and Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19698)
*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE is a four-stage framework that combines LLM-generated rules with probabilistic weighting to enable robust inductive inference, achieving better performance than injecting rules via prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can propose natural-language rules but often ignore interactions among rules; a principled probabilistic integration is needed to achieve reliable inference and handle uncertainty.

Method: Rule generation by an LLM with filtering; logistic regression to assign probabilistic weights; iterative refinement using prediction errors to update the rule set; evaluation comparing weighted-rule classifier vs LLM-injected rules.

Result: Using the learned weighted rules directly as a classifier yields superior accuracy on real-world datasets; prompting LLMs with rules, weights, and logistic outputs degrades accuracy; demonstrates limits of probabilistic integration via LLM prompts.

Conclusion: LLMs are strong at semantic generation and interpretation but less reliable for precise probabilistic integration; coupling them with classic probabilistic rule-aggregation enables more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo is a memory-augmented transformer for reinforcement learning that interleaves periodic summarization tokens to compress experience, enabling long-horizon decision-making with improved efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the context window limits of transformer-based policies in memory-intensive embodied tasks. Humans rely on compressed memories to maintain situational awareness over long times, so scalable memory mechanisms are needed for lifelong autonomous agents.

Method: Introduce Memo, a transformer-based RL architecture and training recipe that creates and retrieves memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the inputs during training. Evaluate on a gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in photo-realistic indoor settings, comparing against naive long-context transformer baselines.

Result: Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines while being more compute- and storage-efficient. It generalizes better to longer inference contexts and remains robust in streaming settings where historical context must be truncated.

Conclusion: Memory-augmented transformers with summarization tokens enable effective long-horizon RL in memory-intensive tasks, offering practical benefits for deployment by improving performance, efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PROBE provides a three-stage pipeline to evaluate proactive LLM agents on unspecific issue search, bottleneck identification, and resolution execution; benchmark reveals state-of-the-art models still underperform, with 40% best end-to-end accuracy among GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that existing benchmarks test only localized contexts and short horizons, PROBE offers a long-horizon, multi-source evaluation of proactivity in agentive systems.

Method: Define PROBE as a pipeline of (1) searching for unspecified issues, (2) identifying bottlenecks, and (3) executing resolutions; apply across leading LLMs and popular agentic frameworks; compute consistent metrics and analyze failure modes.

Result: End-to-end best performance around 40%; results reveal relative strengths of each model and common failure modes; demonstrates current limitations of autonomous action and points to future research directions.

Conclusion: Autonomous agent action remains limited; PROBE provides a robust evaluation framework and insights for improving proactivity in LLM-based agents, guiding future research.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest provides a reward-free, task-agnostic protocol to evaluate world-model learning, instantiated as AutumnBench with grid-world tasks; humans outperform current models, revealing headroom and environment-dependent benefits from more compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate world-model learning for diverse downstream tasks without conflating exploration with reward optimization, and to enable comparison across model types and representations.

Method: Propose WorldTest protocol with a reward-free interaction phase followed by a scored test phase in a related environment. Instantiate AutumnBench with 43 interactive grid-worlds and 129 tasks spanning masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting causal-dynamics changes. Compare 517 humans and 3 frontier models on these tasks; use behavior-based scoring to assess learned world dynamics.

Result: Humans outperform frontier models; scaling compute improves performance only in some environments; AutumnBench reveals substantial headroom for world-model learning and the protocol's ability to evaluate environment dynamics beyond simple next-frame prediction or single-environment rewards.

Conclusion: WorldTest offers a novel, open-ended, reward-free benchmark template and derived tests for assessing world-model learning, with AutumnBench exposing significant opportunities to advance world-model learning beyond current baselines.

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

TL;DR: A proprioception-driven terrain mapping framework for quadruped robots estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability margins, and fuses them into a 2.5D multi-layer gridmap from the robot’s perspective to understand terrain interaction in lunar-like environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Permanently shadowed regions near the lunar poles may host water ice and preserve geological records; robust locomotion on uneven, dark terrain requires legged robots. Exteroceptive sensors alone miss physical interaction with terrain; proprioception enables measurement of interaction forces and costs, informing safer, energy-efficient traversal and data collection.

Method: During locomotion, the robot collects proprioceptive data to estimate terrain interaction metrics (elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, stability margins) and incrementally integrates these metrics into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap from the robot’s perspective, enabling terrain-aware planning.

Result: The approach was evaluated in a lunar-environment simulator with a 21 kg quadruped (Aliengo), showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain conditions.

Conclusion: Proprioception-based terrain mapping can enhance legged lunar exploration by providing terrain interaction metrics that improve planning, safety, and data collection in PSR environments.

Abstract: Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles are of interest for
future exploration due to their potential to contain water ice and preserve
geological records. Their complex, uneven terrain favors the use of legged
robots, which can traverse challenging surfaces while collecting in-situ data,
and have proven effective in Earth analogs, including dark caves, when equipped
with onboard lighting. While exteroceptive sensors like cameras and lidars can
capture terrain geometry and even semantic information, they cannot quantify
its physical interaction with the robot, a capability provided by
proprioceptive sensing. We propose a terrain mapping framework for quadruped
robots, which estimates elevation, foot slippage, energy cost, and stability
margins from internal sensing during locomotion. These metrics are
incrementally integrated into a multi-layer 2.5D gridmap that reflects terrain
interaction from the robot's perspective. The system is evaluated in a
simulator that mimics a lunar environment, using the 21 kg quadruped robot
Aliengo, showing consistent mapping performance under lunar gravity and terrain
conditions.

*Chinmay Burgul,Yewei Huang,Michalis Chatzispyrou,Ioannis Rekleitis,Alberto Quattrini Li,Marios Xanthidis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First study of a compact 3D sonar for underwater SLAM, including camera–sonar extrinsic calibration, surface-dependent acoustic analysis, and end-to-end mapping pipelines tested in challenging underwater environments, with datasets to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in underwater sensing: EM waves are poor underwater, leaving 2D acoustics; a compact 3D sonar could enable robust 3D state estimation, mapping, and localization for underwater autonomy.

Method: Develop extrinsic calibration procedures between the 3D sonar and a camera; characterize acoustic response across surfaces and materials; design and test novel mapping and SLAM pipelines; deploy in underwater cave systems and other acoustically challenging environments; prepare datasets for release.

Result: 3D sonar provides consistent spatial information enabling detailed reconstructions and localization over hundreds of meters; demonstrates potential but also highlights ongoing propagation-related challenges common to acoustic sensors; datasets collected will be released for community use.

Conclusion: 3D sonars offer new capabilities for underwater state estimation, with demonstrated calibration and SLAM pipelines, but challenges in acoustics persist; dataset release will foster further research.

Abstract: In the past decade, the adoption of compact 3D range sensors, such as LiDARs,
has driven the developments of robust state-estimation pipelines, making them a
standard sensor for aerial, ground, and space autonomy. Unfortunately, poor
propagation of electromagnetic waves underwater, has limited the
visibility-independent sensing options of underwater state-estimation to
acoustic range sensors, which provide 2D information including, at-best,
spatially ambiguous information. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first study examining the performance, capacity, and opportunities arising
from the recent introduction of the first compact 3D sonar. Towards that
purpose, we introduce calibration procedures for extracting the extrinsics
between the 3D sonar and a camera and we provide a study on acoustic response
in different surfaces and materials. Moreover, we provide novel mapping and
SLAM pipelines tested in deployments in underwater cave systems and other
geometrically and acoustically challenging underwater environments. Our
assessment showcases the unique capacity of 3D sonars to capture consistent
spatial information allowing for detailed reconstructions and localization in
datasets expanding to hundreds of meters. At the same time it highlights
remaining challenges related to acoustic propagation, as found also in other
acoustic sensors. Datasets collected for our evaluations would be released and
shared with the community to enable further research advancements.

*Susheel Vadakkekuruppath,Herman B. Amundsen,Jason M. O'Kane,Marios Xanthidis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces SHRUMS, an underwater 3D navigation pipeline that integrates 3D sonar, leveraging sensor hallucination to achieve robust, real-time navigation in low-visibility 3D environments, validated on real sonar data; field deployments planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater autonomous navigation faces severe visibility limitations; while terrestrial/aerial robots benefit from 3D sensing, underwater 3D sensing remains nascent. Integrating 3D sonar into a full navigation stack can enhance robustness in complex 3D environments.

Method: Proposes SHRUMS pipeline that hallucinates sensor measurements from non-existent sensors with configurable parameters to handle the 3D sonar data, enabling real-time locally optimal planning and mapping. Validated with real 3D sonar data and online local map construction.

Result: Demonstrates robustness in challenging 3D underwater environments and real-time local mapping using real sonar inputs.

Conclusion: SHRUMS is the first underwater autonomous navigation stack to integrate 3D sonar; field deployments are planned to validate full operation.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in 3D is a fundamental problem for autonomy. Despite
major advancements in terrestrial and aerial settings due to improved range
sensors including LiDAR, compact sensors with similar capabilities for
underwater robots have only recently become available, in the form of 3D
sonars. This paper introduces a novel underwater 3D navigation pipeline, called
SHRUMS (Sensor Hallucination for Robust Underwater Motion planning with 3D
Sonar). To the best of the authors' knowledge, SHRUMS is the first underwater
autonomous navigation stack to integrate a 3D sonar. The proposed pipeline
exhibits strong robustness while operating in complex 3D environments in spite
of extremely poor visibility conditions. To accommodate the intricacies of the
novel sensor data stream while achieving real-time locally optimal performance,
SHRUMS introduces the concept of hallucinating sensor measurements from
non-existent sensors with convenient arbitrary parameters, tailored to
application specific requirements. The proposed concepts are validated with
real 3D sonar sensor data, utilizing real inputs in challenging settings and
local maps constructed in real-time. Field deployments validating the proposed
approach in full are planned in the very near future.

*Zhirui Dai,Qihao Qian,Tianxing Fan,Nikolay Atanasov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid SDF reconstruction method, ∇-SDF, uses a gradient-augmented octree prior plus a neural residual to produce non-truncated, accurate, differentiable SDFs with efficiency comparable to volumetric methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing SDF methods: discrete volumetric approaches constrain continuity/differentiability and neural methods are memory-intensive, struggle with large-scale environments, may forget information, and often yield truncated SDFs; a scalable, non-truncated and differentiable solution is needed for robotics/vision.

Method: Combine an explicit prior from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit neural residual to form a hybrid SDF representation that yields Euclidean (non-truncated) SDFs with efficiency akin to volumetric methods and differentiability/accuracy akin to neural networks.

Result: Extensive experiments show ∇-SDF outperforms the state of the art in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a scalable solution for downstream robotics and computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: A successful hybrid explicit-implicit framework for SDF reconstruction that achieves non-truncated, accurate, differentiable SDFs with practical efficiency, enabling robust large-scale robotics applications.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

### [195] [Motion Planning and Control of an Overactuated 4-Wheel Drive with Constrained Independent Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19054)
*Shiyu Liu,Ilija Hadzic,Akshay Gupta,Aliasghar Arab*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Constraint-aware motion planning and control for an overactuated 4WIS with limited wheel rotation (swerve). Introduces discontinuity planes in velocity space to separate smooth vs. efficient motion, extends ROS Navigation with swerve-aware planning, and validates in simulation and on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The steering limitations of a 4WIS create a constrained, discontinuous configuration space, making existing planners ineffective at producing smooth, feasible trajectories. There is a need to integrate steering constraints into planning and control so that motion is feasible and efficient.

Method: (1) Formulate steering constraints mathematically for 4WIS with limited steering range. (2) Derive discontinuity planes that partition velocity space into regions of smooth/efficient motion. (3) Design a motion planner for path tracking and obstacle avoidance that explicitly enforces swerve constraints and smooth velocity transitions. (4) Implement a local-feedback controller to translate desired velocity into wheel actuation, including a mechanism to handle discontinuity crossings by stopping briefly and reorienting wheels. (5) Extend ROS Navigation with the proposed planner and validate in simulation and on a physical 4WIS platform.

Result: The framework identifies velocity-space regions separated by discontinuity planes, enabling generation of feasible, smooth trajectories that respect swerve constraints. The planner effectively handles obstacle avoidance and path tracking under steering limits. The controller’s discontinuity handling mechanism ensures safe transitions. The ROS-extension successfully integrates the planner, with successful demonstrations in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed constraint-aware planning/control approach makes feasible motion for overactuated 4WIS platforms with limited steering, by explicitly accounting for velocity-space discontinuities. It provides a practical ROS-based tool for practitioners and is validated on hardware and in simulation.

Abstract: This paper addresses motion planning and con- trol of an overactuated 4-wheel
drive train with independent steering (4WIS) where mechanical constraints
prevent the wheels from executing full 360-degree rotations (swerve). The
configuration space of such a robot is constrained and contains discontinuities
that affect the smoothness of the robot motion. We introduce a mathematical
formulation of the steering constraints and derive discontinuity planes that
partition the velocity space into regions of smooth and efficient motion. We
further design the motion planner for path tracking and ob- stacle avoidance
that explicitly accounts for swerve constraints and the velocity transition
smoothness. The motion controller uses local feedback to generate actuation
from the desired velocity, while properly handling the discontinuity crossing
by temporarily stopping the motion and repositioning the wheels. We implement
the proposed motion planner as an extension to ROS Navigation package and
evaluate the system in simulation and on a physical robot.

### [196] [Convex Maneuver Planning for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19058)
*Fausto Vega,Jon Arrizabalaga,Ryan Watson,Zachary Manchester*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to compute low-thrust, collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term conjunctions by solving a nonconvex QCQP; relax via Shor's SDP to obtain globally optimal, minimum-energy maneuvers meeting a collision-probability constraint; if infeasible, use a penalty-based minimum-risk solution; validated in high-fidelity LEO simulations with CDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing satellite density in low-Earth orbit makes manual, repetitive collision-avoidance planning impractical. There is a need for autonomous, efficient, and reliable algorithms that can compute maneuver plans with provable optimality and specified collision risk.

Method: Formulate the maneuver design as a nonconvex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Relax to a convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation and demonstrate tightness, enabling recovery of globally optimal solutions to the original problem. Optimize for minimum-energy maneuvers while enforcing a specified probability of collision at the time of closest approach; if the probability constraint is infeasible, replace it with a penalty term to obtain a minimum-risk solution. Validate with high-fidelity LEO conjunction simulations using a simulated conjunction data message (CDM).

Result: Empirically, the SDP relaxation is tight, allowing recovery of globally optimal solutions to the original QCQP. The framework yields minimum-energy collision-avoidance maneuvers that satisfy a target collision probability, and a penalty-based variant provides a minimum-risk maneuver when the probability constraint cannot be met. Validation in high-fidelity simulations demonstrates effective collision risk reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed QCQP-to-SDP relaxation yields a practical, theoretically grounded autonomous collision-avoidance method for short-term conjunctions in LEO. The tight relaxation enables global optimality guarantees for the original nonconvex problem, and the penalty variant provides a robust fallback when risk constraints are infeasible, with demonstrated effectiveness using CDM-based simulations.

Abstract: Conjunction analysis and maneuver planning for spacecraft collision avoidance
remains a manual and time-consuming process, typically involving repeated
forward simulations of hand-designed maneuvers. With the growing density of
satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), autonomy is becoming essential for
efficiently evaluating and mitigating collisions. In this work, we present an
algorithm to design low-thrust collision-avoidance maneuvers for short-term
conjunction events. We first formulate the problem as a nonconvex
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which we then relax into a
convex semidefinite program (SDP) using Shor's relaxation. We demonstrate
empirically that the relaxation is tight, which enables the recovery of
globally optimal solutions to the original nonconvex problem. Our formulation
produces a minimum-energy solution while ensuring a desired probability of
collision at the time of closest approach. Finally, if the desired probability
of collision cannot be satisfied, we relax this constraint into a penalty,
yielding a minimum-risk solution. We validate our algorithm with a
high-fidelity simulation of a satellite conjunction in low-Earth orbit with a
simulated conjunction data message (CDM), demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing collision risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current control strategies for compliant prosthetic wrists struggle with adaptability and computational cost, hindering real-time deployment; there is a need for accurate, responsive, adaptable control of soft, tendon-driven wrists.

Method: Develop a neural-network-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist. Model the wrist dynamics via Timoshenko beam theory. The NN-MRAC estimates tendon forces from deflection errors and online adapts to minimize deviation from a reference model.

Result: Simulation: RMSE = 6.14×10^-4 m; settling time = 3.2 s. Experiments: average RMSE = 5.66×10^-3 m; steady-state error = 8.05×10^-3 m; settling time = 1.58 s.

Conclusion: The NN-MRAC approach enhances motion accuracy and responsiveness of soft prosthetic wrists and demonstrates the viability of adaptive intelligent control in wearable assistive devices.

Abstract: The functionality and natural motion of prosthetic hands remain limited by
the challenges in controlling compliant wrist mechanisms. Current control
strategies often lack adaptability and incur high computational costs, which
impedes real-time deployment in assistive robotics. To address this gap, this
study presents a computationally efficient Neural Network (NN)-based Model
Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist
integrated with a prosthetic hand. The dynamic modeling of the wrist is
formulated using Timoshenko beam theory, capturing both shear and bending
deformations. The proposed NN-MRAC estimates the required tendon forces from
deflection errors and minimizes deviation from a reference model through online
adaptation. Simulation results demonstrate improved precision with a root mean
square error (RMSE) of $6.14 \times 10^{-4}$ m and a settling time of $3.2$s.
Experimental validations confirm real-time applicability, with an average RMSE
of $5.66 \times 10^{-3}$ m, steady-state error of $8.05 \times 10^{-3}$ m, and
settling time of $1.58$ s. These results highlight the potential of the
controller to enhance motion accuracy and responsiveness in soft prosthetic
systems, thereby advancing the integration of adaptive intelligent control in
wearable assistive devices.

Motivation: Address hybrid mode control where modes are non-differentiable and algorithmic, requiring efficient discrete search and robust performance guarantees for robotics tasks that mix planning and reactive control.

Method: Formulate hybrid control as discrete (integer) decisions over mode, switch times, and mode durations; develop a sample-based variation to efficiently search the integer domain for near-optimal solutions.

Result: Provides strong performance guarantees; capable of synthesizing complex algorithms and policies; validated on real-world robotics tasks that require reactive switching between long-term planning and high-frequency control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles hybrid mode control in robotics, enabling policy synthesis and robust switching between planning and control across diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates a sample-based solution to the hybrid mode control
problem across non-differentiable and algorithmic hybrid modes. Our approach
reasons about a set of hybrid control modes as an integer-based optimization
problem where we select what mode to apply, when to switch to another mode, and
the duration for which we are in a given control mode. A sample-based variation
is derived to efficiently search the integer domain for optimal solutions. We
find our formulation yields strong performance guarantees that can be applied
to a number of robotics-related tasks. In addition, our approach is able to
synthesize complex algorithms and policies to compound behaviors and achieve
challenging tasks. Last, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
real-world robotic examples that require reactive switching between long-term
planning and high-frequency control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots using force interactions can assess terrain more reliably than remote sensing, but ultra-deformable or unstable granular terrains still pose safety and traversability challenges, especially when visual input is unreliable.

Method: Online estimation of safe and frontier regions from leg-terrain interactions via Gaussian Process regression to assess traversability, coupled with a reactive controller for real-time safe exploration and navigation.

Result: Demonstrated safe exploration and navigation toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively estimated traversability in simulation.

Conclusion: Proprioceptive, GP-based safety estimation enables safe active exploration in granular terrains without relying on vision, showing promise for real-world deployment with further validation.

Abstract: Legged robots can sense terrain through force interactions during locomotion,
offering more reliable traversability estimates than remote sensing and serving
as scouts for guiding wheeled rovers in challenging environments. However, even
legged scouts face challenges when traversing highly deformable or unstable
terrain. We present Safe Active Exploration for Granular Terrain (SAEGT), a
navigation framework that enables legged robots to safely explore unknown
granular environments using proprioceptive sensing, particularly where visual
input fails to capture terrain deformability. SAEGT estimates the safe region

regression for traversability assessment, with a reactive controller for
real-time safe exploration and navigation. SAEGT demonstrated its ability to
safely explore and navigate toward a specified goal using only proprioceptively

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, zero-shot transferable path-planning framework (GADGET) that integrates environment-aware conditioning and CBF safety into denoising, enabling generalization to unseen environments and multiple manipulators without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient, safe, and adaptable planning in high-dimensional cluttered spaces. Conventional methods are slow and tuned per environment; prior learning-based methods lack generalization to new robots/environments.

Method: GADGET uses a diffusion model to generate joint-space trajectories conditioned on voxelized scene representations and start/goal configurations. It employs a hybrid dual-conditioning: classifier-free guidance via a learned scene encoding and classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance inside the denoising process for zero-shot transfer.

Result: Higher success rates with low collision intensity in spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf scenarios; CBF guidance enhances safety; strong performance vs both sampling-based and learning-based baselines; transfers across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3 (6/7-DoF), and UR5; real-world Kinova Gen3 experiment shows safe, collision-free trajectories.

Conclusion: Proposes a generalizable, adaptive diffusion-guided trajectory framework that transfers across unseen environments and robotic embodiments without retraining, offering safety through CBF shaping and competitive performance in diverse tasks; real-world validation supports practicality.

Abstract: Path planning for a robotic system in high-dimensional cluttered environments
needs to be efficient, safe, and adaptable for different environments and
hardware. Conventional methods face high computation time and require extensive
parameter tuning, while prior learning-based methods still fail to generalize
effectively. The primary goal of this research is to develop a path planning
framework capable of generalizing to unseen environments and new robotic
manipulators without the need for retraining. We present GADGET (Generalizable
and Adaptive Diffusion-Guided Environment-aware Trajectory generation), a
diffusion-based planning model that generates joint-space trajectories
conditioned on voxelized scene representations as well as start and goal
configurations. A key innovation is GADGET's hybrid dual-conditioning mechanism
that combines classifier-free guidance via learned scene encoding with
classifier-guided Control Barrier Function (CBF) safety shaping, integrating
environment awareness with real-time collision avoidance directly in the
denoising process. This design supports zero-shot transfer to new environments
and robotic embodiments without retraining. Experimental results show that
GADGET achieves high success rates with low collision intensity in
spherical-obstacle, bin-picking, and shelf environments, with CBF guidance
further improving safety. Moreover, comparative evaluations indicate strong
performance relative to both sampling-based and learning-based baselines.
Furthermore, GADGET provides transferability across Franka Panda, Kinova Gen3
(6/7-DoF), and UR5 robots, and physical execution on a Kinova Gen3 demonstrates
its ability to generate safe, collision-free trajectories in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRASPLAT trains dexterous grasping from RGB data by synthesizing physically plausible hand-object images using 3D Gaussian Splatting and regressing hand joints end-to-end, aided by a photometric loss to align rendered and real images, yielding strong gains over image-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous multi-finger grasping with 3D hands remains difficult due to the need for high-quality 3D data. RGB-only data is easier to collect, motivating methods that can learn from images while leveraging 3D-aware synthesis to infer grasps.

Method: Use 3D Gaussian Splatting to render high-fidelity novel views of real hand–object interactions and generate synthetic grasp images. Train end-to-end to regress hand joints from RGB inputs, with a photometric loss that minimizes differences between rendered (synthetic) and real images, enabling RGB-only supervision for grasp poses.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real grasp datasets show up to 36.9% improvement in grasp success over existing image-based methods.

Conclusion: GRASPLAT demonstrates that RGB-only training, aided by 3D-aware image synthesis and a photometric loss, can achieve strong dexterous grasping performance, suggesting a viable path to reducing reliance on high-quality 3D scans for grasp pose estimation.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous hierarchical framework for long-horizon deformable linear object routing that uses vision-language models for high-level planning and RL-based low-level skills, with a failure-recovery mechanism; achieves 92.5% success and about 50% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon DLO routing is hard due to nonlinear dynamics, the need to decompose abstract routing goals, and the requirement for multi-step skill execution with reliable planning; a robust autonomous approach is valuable in industrial and daily contexts.

Method: A hierarchical framework where vision-language models perform in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize plans from language goals, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via reinforcement learning. A failure-recovery mechanism reorients the DLO into insertion-feasible states to improve long-horizon robustness. The approach generalizes across diverse scenes with varying object attributes, spatial descriptions, and implicit commands.

Result: The method outperforms the next best baseline by nearly 50% and achieves an overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a viable autonomous hierarchical pipeline that combines VLM-based planning with RL-based skills and a failure-recovery module to tackle challenging DLO routing tasks, showing strong performance and broad generalization potential.

Abstract: Long-horizon routing tasks of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as
cables and ropes, are common in industrial assembly lines and everyday life.
These tasks are particularly challenging because they require robots to
manipulate DLO with long-horizon planning and reliable skill execution.
Successfully completing such tasks demands adapting to their nonlinear
dynamics, decomposing abstract routing goals, and generating multi-step plans
composed of multiple skills, all of which require accurate high-level reasoning
during execution. In this paper, we propose a fully autonomous hierarchical
framework for solving challenging DLO routing tasks. Given an implicit or
explicit routing goal expressed in language, our framework leverages
vision-language models~(VLMs) for in-context high-level reasoning to synthesize
feasible plans, which are then executed by low-level skills trained via
reinforcement learning. To improve robustness in long horizons, we further
introduce a failure recovery mechanism that reorients the DLO into
insertion-feasible states. Our approach generalizes to diverse scenes involving
object attributes, spatial descriptions, as well as implicit language commands.
It outperforms the next best baseline method by nearly 50% and achieves an
overall success rate of 92.5% across long-horizon routing scenarios.

TL;DR: A domain-specific taxonomy (TARMAC) for robot manipulation in chemistry that defines reusable primitives and macros to enable scalable, autonomous laboratory automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current experiment abstractions describe only protocol steps and lack a systematic, transferable representation of robotic manipulation skills, hindering autonomy and portability across systems in chemistry labs.

Method: Develop TARMAC from annotated teaching-lab demonstrations, categorize actions by functional role and physical execution, validate experimentally, and instantiate as robot-executable primitives and macros for composition into long-horizon workflows.

Result: A formal taxonomy of core lab manipulation actions, with an implementation pathway as primitives and macros enabling skill reuse and integration into complex workflows; validated experimentally.

Conclusion: TARMAC provides a structured foundation for flexible, autonomous chemistry automation and improves transferability of manipulation skills across robotic platforms.

Abstract: Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
laboratory automation. More information is available at

### [205] [Imitation Learning Policy based on Multi-Step Consistent Integration Shortcut Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19356)
*Yu Fang,Xinyu Wang,Xuehe Zhang,Wanli Xue,Mingwei Zhang,Shengyong Chen,Jie Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fast one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration and adaptive gradient allocation for robot imitation learning, achieving faster inference with competitive performance and improved training stability, validated on two simulation benchmarks and five real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference time in flow-matching methods and the insufficiency of existing distillation and consistency approaches to match diffusion/flow-matching performance, motivating a faster yet accurate imitation learning method.

Method: Introduce a one-step shortcut model augmented with multi-step integration. Extend multi-step consistency loss around the shortcut model, decompose the one-step loss into multi-step losses, and implement an adaptive gradient allocation strategy to stabilize optimization of both multi-step and original flow-matching losses.

Result: Experimental results on two simulation benchmarks and five real-world tasks demonstrate faster inference with competitive or improved performance and enhanced training stability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances inference speed and performance in robot imitation learning, with improved training stability and demonstrated applicability across simulation and real-world tasks.

Abstract: The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the
development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the
problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have
proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of
these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion
models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step
shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To
balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step
consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss
into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference.
Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss
and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation
method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate
the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world
environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Probabilistic framework modeling spatially correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters, propagated through a differentiable physics engine for high-resolution trajectory forecasting; improves uncertainty estimation and trajectory accuracy on off-road datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty-aware motion prediction in unstructured, off-road environments by capturing local spatial correlations in 3D terrain data, which are ignored by many existing methods that assume deterministic or spatially independent uncertainties.

Method: An efficient probabilistic world model that encodes spatially correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters and propagates it through a differentiable physics engine. Uses structured convolutional operators to produce high-resolution, multivariate predictions with manageable computational cost.

Result: Experimental evaluation on a public dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation and trajectory prediction accuracy over baselines that only model aleatoric uncertainty.

Conclusion: Modeling spatially correlated terrain uncertainty within a probabilistic world model and propagating it through differentiable physics improves both uncertainty estimation and trajectory forecasting in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware robot motion prediction is crucial for downstream
traversability estimation and safe autonomous navigation in unstructured,
off-road environments, where terrain is heterogeneous and perceptual
uncertainty is high. Most existing methods assume deterministic or spatially
independent terrain uncertainties, ignoring the inherent local correlations of
3D spatial data and often producing unreliable predictions. In this work, we
introduce an efficient probabilistic framework that explicitly models spatially
correlated aleatoric uncertainty over terrain parameters as a probabilistic
world model and propagates this uncertainty through a differentiable physics
engine for probabilistic trajectory forecasting. By leveraging structured
convolutional operators, our approach provides high-resolution multivariate
predictions at manageable computational cost. Experimental evaluation on a
publicly available dataset shows significantly improved uncertainty estimation
and trajectory prediction accuracy over aleatoric uncertainty estimation
baselines.

*Basavasagar Patil,Sydney Belt,Jayjun Lee,Nima Fazeli,Bernadette Bucher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight sampling strategy to balance imbalanced robotic action datasets improves generalization across tasks, validated on pre-training and fine-tuning of models, including real-world experiments with a Franka Panda robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic datasets are skewed: many task descriptions yield similar physical actions, causing imbalance in action distributions. This impairs learning and generalization, especially for low-resource tasks; a simple, easily integrable solution is needed that preserves high-resource performance.

Method: A simple sampling scheme integrated into policy training that requires only a few lines of code. It aims to re-balance training across physical actions and tasks, applicable to pre-training small models and fine-tuning large foundation models, and is validated in both simulation and real-world settings.

Result: The approach yields substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared with prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance on high-resource tasks; improves generalization and enables more efficient use of model capacity for multi-task policies.

Conclusion: A minimal, practical solution to dataset imbalance in robotic policy learning that generalizes across tasks and resource regimes, with validation on diverse tasks in real-world experiments (Franka Panda).

Abstract: Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.

### [208] [Risk Assessment of an Autonomous Underwater Snake Robot in Confined Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19415)
*Abdelrahman Sayed Sayed*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Bayesian risk assessment framework to estimate and mitigate the risk of losing the Eely underwater robot across two missions, with sensitivity analysis to identify the dominant factors affecting loss and guide improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ocean discovery requires inspection/intervention in confined, demanding environments. Eely’s slender, adjustable-articulated design is promising, but operation in uncertain, harsh, and navigation-limited underwater settings makes loss a key risk. A quantitative approach is needed to evaluate and reduce this risk.

Method: Develop a Bayesian risk assessment framework for two mission scenarios that models uncertainties in the environment, robot dynamics, and sensing. Update risk estimates with observations, and perform sensitivity analysis to rank factors contributing to loss. Apply the framework to assess Eely’s risk and guide improvements.

Result: The framework yields quantified loss-risk estimates for the two scenarios. Sensitivity analysis identifies the factors with the greatest influence on the probability of losing Eely, demonstrating the approach’s ability to pinpoint high-impact risks and inform mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: A Bayesian risk-based approach can improve Eely’s performance and mission success likelihood by focusing on high-impact risk factors identified through sensitivity analysis, with potential implications for design, control, sensing, and mission planning.

Abstract: The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.

TL;DR: GigaBrain-0 uses world-model-generated data to train a Vision-Language-Action foundation model for robots, reducing real-data needs and improving cross-task generalization; includes RGBD and embodied CoT; offers a lightweight edge-device variant GigaBrain-0-Small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale real-world robot data is expensive and slow, limiting scalability and generalization of VLA systems.

Method: Leverage world-model-generated data (video generation, real2real, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real) to train a VLA foundation model; incorporate RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought supervision to reason about geometry, states, and long-horizon tasks; present a compact variant for edge devices.

Result: Achieves superior generalization across appearance, placement, and viewpoint variations; substantial real-world performance gains on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks; introduces GigaBrain-0-Small optimized for NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

Conclusion: World-model data generation combined with RGBD-CoT leads to scalable, robust VLA foundation models with improved cross-task generalization and edge-device feasibility.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

*Kevin Huang,Rosario Scalise,Cleah Winston,Ayush Agrawal,Yunchu Zhang,Rohan Baijal,Markus Grotz,Byron Boots,Benjamin Burchfiel,Hongkai Dai,Masha Itkina,Paarth Shah,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline reinforcement learning can leverage non-expert gameplay data to improve imitation-learning policies by expanding the policy's support and improving generalization in robotics manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning relies on high-quality, task-specific data. Non-expert data (play data, suboptimal demos, partial tasks) offers broader coverage and lower collection costs but is underutilized by standard IL; offline RL could unlock this potential with proper design, enabling robustness to real-world variation.

Method: Introduce simple algorithmic modifications to offline RL to broaden the policy distribution's support and better exploit non-expert data, enabling offline IL to utilize all collected data (including partial/suboptimal demonstrations) without heavy additional assumptions.

Result: With the proposed modifications, offline RL-augmented imitation learning achieves better recovery and generalization, expands the range of initial conditions from which policies succeed in manipulation tasks, and leverages all data (including partial/dubious demonstrations) to boost task performance.

Conclusion: Algorithmic choices that widen policy support and effectively exploit non-expert data are crucial for robust, data-efficient policy learning in robotics; offline RL can meaningfully augment imitation learning when designed to handle non-expert data.

Abstract: Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform
complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by
its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to
the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In
contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,
partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer
broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation
learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these
challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement
learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the
performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline
RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under
the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world,
simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data,
without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening
the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented
by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery
and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations
significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies
are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that
these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or
suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This
underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data
for robust policy learning in robotics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve prosthetic hand adaptability, responsiveness, and intuitiveness; existing controllers may lack predictive capability or require heavy computation.

Method: Develop MPC to regulate wrist motion; model kinematics with Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and dynamics with Lagrange methods; implement for a soft continuum wrist attached to a tendon-driven hand; emphasize reduced computational load; validate via simulations and experiments.

Result: Demonstrated effective wrist articulation improvement; simulations and experiments show enhanced dexterity and more natural, intuitive movements with lower computational demand.

Conclusion: MPC-based control for probabilistic predictive prosthetic wrist is a promising direction for intelligent prosthetic systems, enabling better user intent anticipation and responsive control.

Abstract: The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
prosthetic systems.

*Hongyu Ding,Ziming Xu,Yudong Fang,You Wu,Zixuan Chen,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yifan Zhang,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LaViRA introduces a zero-shot, coarse-to-fine framework for VLN-CE that decomposes action into Language Action, Vision Action, and Robot Action, enabling targeted use of Multimodal LLMs for planning, grounding, and navigation, achieving strong generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN-CE approaches face a trade-off between environment-specific waypoint predictors (which limit generalization) and underutilizing the reasoning capabilities of large models during navigation. A zero-shot, generalizable framework is needed.

Method: Propose a modular hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. Each module leverages different scales of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to exploit their strengths in reasoning, grounding, and control, enabling zero-shot navigation without task-specific training.

Result: Significant outperformance of state-of-the-art methods on the VLN-CE benchmark, with improved generalization to unseen environments and preserved transparency and practicality for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: A simple modular decomposition that harnesses the strengths of MLLMs at multiple scales can deliver strong zero-shot VLN-CE performance with better generalization and deployment feasibility.

Abstract: Zero-shot Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)
requires an agent to navigate unseen environments based on natural language
instructions without any prior training. Current methods face a critical
trade-off: either rely on environment-specific waypoint predictors that limit
scene generalization, or underutilize the reasoning capabilities of large
models during navigation. We introduce LaViRA, a simple yet effective zero-shot
framework that addresses this dilemma by decomposing action into a
coarse-to-fine hierarchy: Language Action for high-level planning, Vision
Action for perceptual grounding, and Robot Action for robust navigation. This
modular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different
scales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a
system that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.
LaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the
VLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen
environments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world
deployment.

TL;DR: A tri-hardware pipeline enabling fast onboard marker detection for visual relative localization in UAV swarms, achieving substantial acceleration on CPU, GPU, and FPGA, enabling real-time operation on embedded platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time onboard relative localization for agile UAV swarms requires fast, low-latency detection of isolated markers; existing methods are too slow for onboard processing, hindering scalable swarming.

Method: Develop and evaluate three implementations: an optimized CPU algorithm, a GPU shader program, and an FPGA streaming architecture, all aimed at minimizing the latency from camera exposure to detection. Performance is measured on various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms and compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: CPU and GPU implementations achieved mean per-pixel processing time improvements of 2–3 orders of magnitude over the state of the art; the FPGA-based solution yielded the largest reduction in total latency from camera exposure to detection results; demonstration across multiple embedded platforms shows feasibility for low-end UAVs/MAVs.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-hardware approach is a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming, enabling real-time onboard relative localization through fast marker detection on CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms.

Abstract: A novel approach for the fast onboard detection of isolated markers for
visual relative localisation of multiple teammates in agile UAV swarms is
introduced in this paper. As the detection forms a key component of real-time
localisation systems, a three-fold innovation is presented, consisting of an
optimised procedure for CPUs, a GPU shader program, and a functionally
equivalent FPGA streaming architecture. For the proposed CPU and GPU solutions,
the mean processing time per pixel of input camera frames was accelerated by
two to three orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. For the
localisation task, the proposed FPGA architecture offered the most significant
overall acceleration by minimising the total delay from camera exposure to
detection results. Additionally, the proposed solutions were evaluated on
various 32-bit and 64-bit embedded platforms to demonstrate their efficiency,
as well as their feasibility for applications using low-end UAVs and MAVs.
Thus, it has become a crucial enabling technology for agile UAV swarming.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LITEN links a low-level VLA policy with a high-level VLM that learns from past execution by conditioning on in-context experiences, enabling iterative reasoning and assessment to plan long-horizon robotic tasks with structured failure reflection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable adaptive, self-refining control for robotics by allowing a model to reflect on unstructured real-world trajectories (e.g., videos) and learn the affordances of the low-level policy to improve future planning.

Method: Propose Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN): alternating between a reasoning phase that plans for the low-level VLA and an assessment phase that reflects on execution and updates the context. Past experiences are incorporated in-context to condition the VLM; assessment uses structured guiderails to handle unstructured robot trajectories.

Result: Empirical results show LITEN can effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: LITEN demonstrates a viable path for connecting VLA policies with high-level VLMs to enable context-aware, self-refining planning in robotics, while highlighting the need for structured guidance during the assessment of real-world trajectories.

Abstract: Solving complex real-world control tasks often takes multiple tries: if we
fail at first, we reflect on what went wrong, and change our strategy
accordingly to avoid making the same mistake. In robotics,
Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) offer a promising path towards solving
complex control tasks, but lack the ability to contextually and dynamically
readjust behavior when they fail to accomplish a task. In this work, we
introduce Learning from Inference-Time Execution (LITEN), which connects a VLA
low-level policy to a high-level VLM that conditions on past experiences by
including them in-context, allowing it to learn the affordances and
capabilities of the low-level VLA. Our approach iterates between a reasoning
phase that generates and executes plans for the low-level VLA, and an
assessment phase that reflects on the resulting execution and draws useful
conclusions to be included in future reasoning contexts. Unlike similar
approaches to self-refinement in non-robotics domains, LITEN must reflect on
unstructured real-world robot trajectories (e.g., raw videos), which requires
structured guiderails during assessment. Our experimental results demonstrate
LITEN is able to effectively learn from past experience to generate plans that
use high-affordance instructions to accomplish long-horizon tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SEA delivers improved active exploration by combining semantic map prediction with a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical policy, using iterative missing-map prediction and a novel reward to guide long-term exploration for better global-map coverage in limited steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based exploration relies on short-horizon, one-step waypoint prediction, which limits long-term environmental understanding. The authors aim to enhance exploration efficiency and semantic map accuracy by predicting missing map areas and aligning exploration with predicted global maps.

Method: Propose SEA: an iterative prediction-exploration framework that predicts missing map regions from current observations and uses the discrepancy between accumulated and predicted maps to steer exploration. It employs a reinforcement-learning-based hierarchical policy with a novel reward mechanism to improve long-term exploration strategies and semantic map construction within limited steps.

Result: Experiments show SEA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration methods, achieving higher coverage of the global map within the same time constraints.

Conclusion: Integrating semantic map prediction with an RL-driven hierarchical exploration policy enables more efficient and accurate semantic mapping, surpassing existing methods in coverage and effectiveness under time limits.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SEA, a novel approach for active robot exploration
through semantic map prediction and a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical
exploration policy. Unlike existing learning-based methods that rely on
one-step waypoint prediction, our approach enhances the agent's long-term
environmental understanding to facilitate more efficient exploration. We
propose an iterative prediction-exploration framework that explicitly predicts
the missing areas of the map based on current observations. The difference
between the actual accumulated map and the predicted global map is then used to
guide exploration. Additionally, we design a novel reward mechanism that
leverages reinforcement learning to update the long-term exploration
strategies, enabling us to construct an accurate semantic map within limited
steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies, achieving superior
coverage ares of the global map within the same time constraints.
