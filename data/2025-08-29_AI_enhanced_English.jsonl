In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow\nwhere dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed\ntooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training\nnetwork for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing\nautomated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view\nfrom panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then\npretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The\nglobal-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating\nregion proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts\ndetailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the\nregion proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we\nintroduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically\nfuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the\nfused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To\nrigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further\nvalidate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries\ndetection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays\nfor double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior\nperformance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,\nindicating the clinical applicability of our method.
