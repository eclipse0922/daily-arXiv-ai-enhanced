### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes positive sampling Kantorovich operators (SK) and related operators (Gaussian, Bilateral, wavelet-based) focusing on convergence, local/global approximation, and practical image-analytic performance with various error metrics; numerical examples illustrate ROI and phantom analysis, showing no single best operator across all image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend understanding of SK operators' approximation properties and assess their effectiveness in image processing under ideal and non-ideal conditions, using comprehensive metrics (MSE, SI, SSI, SMPI, ENL) and ROI analysis.

Method: Define SK and related operators; establish the fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA) under suitable conditions; derive error bounds; compute and compare MSE, SI, SSI, SMPI, ENL across operators and levels of resolution; provide tabulated ideal-condition example and a 2D ROI analysis on a 3D Shepp-Logan phantom slice.

Result: Found operator-specific strengths; some operators perform well for certain features while others do not under non-ideal conditions; FTA held; performance quantified via MSE, SI, SSI, SMPI, ENL; ROI analysis supports the claims.

Conclusion: No universal best operator; choice should be guided by image features and conditions; SK framework offers flexible trade-offs; suggests further work on feature-aware operator selection and optimization.

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning for pose-based HAR in industrial settings, using a custom skeletal dataset; FL, especially Transformer-based, improves cross-user generalization and privacy compared to centralized training, with notable gains set against unseen clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial environments demand actionable HAR while preserving worker privacy and handling diverse users; centralized datasets are impractical; FL offers privacy and potential generalization benefits across heterogeneous clients.

Method: A skeletal HAR dataset of eight upper-body gestures from five participants with a modified FastPose backbone; two temporal backbones (LSTM and Transformer). Four training paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with FedAvg, and FL with FedEnsemble. Evaluations on a global test set and an unseen external client.

Result: On the global test set, FL with Transformer beats centralized by 12.4 percentage points; FedEnsemble beats centralized by 16.3 pp. On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by 52.6 pp and 58.3 pp, respectively.

Conclusion: Federated learning both preserves privacy and markedly improves cross-user generalization for pose-based HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings, offering a practical, scalable solution.

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

### [3] [LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153)
*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS uses reinforcement learning to jointly optimize chain-of-thought reasoning and image segmentation for text-prompted segmentation, achieving strong performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning often ignores test-time explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which harms generalization to unseen prompts and domains.

Method: An end-to-end RL framework (LENS) with unified rewards across sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues to encourage informative CoT rationales while refining segmentation. It utilizes Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3B) as the backbone model.

Result: Average cIoU 81.2% on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, outperforming the strong fine-tuned baseline GLaMM by up to 5.6%.

Conclusion: RL-driven CoT reasoning provides a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and supports more generalizable Segment Anything models; code is released.

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at
https://github.com/hustvl/LENS.

*Ronghao Dang,Yuqian Yuan,Yunxuan Mao,Kehan Li,Jiangpin Liu,Zhikai Wang,Xin Li,Fan Wang,Deli Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact, region-centric video multimodal LLM (RynnEC) for embodied cognition, featuring a region encoder and mask decoder to enable fine-grained video interactions. It achieves state-of-the-art object-property understanding, segmentation, and spatial reasoning, and is complemented by an egocentric-data generation pipeline and RynnEC-Bench benchmark. The work proposes a new region-centric video paradigm for embodied agents and releases code, models, and benchmarks to support generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To equip embodied agents with fine-grained, region-level perception and reasoning in the physical world, addressing the lack of 3D annotated data and the need for a general cognitive core capable of diverse embodied tasks.

Method: Build on a general-purpose vision-language foundation model and add a region encoder plus a mask decoder to support region-level video interaction. Propose a region-centric video paradigm, develop an egocentric video-based data generation pipeline for embodied cognition, and create RynnEC-Bench for evaluation of embodied cognitive capabilities.

Result: RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding, object segmentation, and spatial reasoning with a compact architecture. The approach also provides a practical data-generation pipeline and a dedicated benchmark, with resources released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: RynnEC advances the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents and supports better generalization across diverse embodied tasks through a region-centric, fine-grained video understanding paradigm.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

### [5] [Local Scale Equivariance with Latent Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14187)
*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight module called DEC enforces local scale equivariance, improving ImageNet performance and scale-consistency for several pre-trained models; plug-and-play with ViT, DeiT, Swin, BEiT; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale variation is ubiquitous and local to objects; different object sizes within an image require local scale-aware representations. A method that enforces local scale equivariance can improve robustness and consistency of vision models.

Method: Introduce a Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer (DEC) that enforces local scale equivariance. It is designed as a plug-in module that can be incorporated into existing architectures and can be adapted to pre-trained models, enabling local scale consistency without redesigning entire networks.

Result: On ImageNet, DEC improves both overall model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained networks (ViT, DeiT, Swin, BEiT).

Conclusion: DEC provides an easy-to-adopt, plug-in solution to handle local scale variation, boosting accuracy and consistency; code is available at the provided link.

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

### [6] [CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197)
*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym uses CLIP with a rotation-equivariant decoder and Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping to detect rotation and reflection symmetry, achieving state-of-the-art results on DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is a fundamental geometric cue in vision, and leveraging language-grounded priors from CLIP may enhance symmetry detection by incorporating semantic cues from natural image descriptions.

Method: The approach uses CLIP's image and language encoders, coupled with a rotation-equivariant decoder built from Transformer and G-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetry. A novel Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG) aggregates diverse, frequent object-based prompts to better integrate semantic cues from language. The model is evaluated on three standard symmetry datasets (DENDI, SDRW, LDRS) with ablations.

Result: CLIPSym outperforms current state-of-the-art on all three datasets. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of CLIP pre-training, the equivariant decoder, and the SAPG prompting strategy.

Conclusion: CLIP pretraining and the SAPG technique meaningfully improve symmetry detection, with the proposed equivariant decoder contributing to robustness across rotation and reflection symmetries. The work demonstrates the value of combining vision-language priors with geometry-aware architectures for geometric cue detection.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as
online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across
three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCN-based image classification using Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations; introduces normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN) that speeds up preprocessing and improves accuracy, outperforming SOTA on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage graph-based representations to model non-Euclidean relationships in images and tackle limitations of traditional CNNs in complex scenes and fine-grained categories.

Method: Represent images as graphs built from pixels/regions; use Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to structure the graph; introduce NVGCN (normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network) to perform classification; evaluate via cross-validation on benchmark datasets.

Result: Achieves significant reductions in preprocessing time and higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art models, particularly in complex and fine-grained tasks.

Conclusion: Presents a novel graph-based framework for image classification, introduces NVGCN, and suggests that graph-based learning with Voronoi/Delaunay structures can extend to other CV and non-structured-domain tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

### [9] [Directed-Tokens: A Robust Multi-Modality Alignment Approach to Large Language-Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14264)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Huu-Thien Tran,Tran Thai Son,Bhiksha Raj,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple learning mechanism that improves robust alignment of visual and textual modalities in large multimodal models by solving shuffling problems (reconstructing image and text order), using a directed-token approach and an Image-to-Response Guided loss, achieving SoTA on task-oriented and instruction-following benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness and generalization limitations in LMMs arising from misalignment/correlation between visual and textual features; enhance cross-modal alignment, reasoning, and visual understanding.

Method: 1) Introduce two pretraining/fine-tuning tasks: reconstruct the image order and reconstruct the text order. 2) Propose a directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge and enable reconstructing the correct visual input order. 3) Add an Image-to-Response Guided loss to improve visual understanding in model responses.

Result: Consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks, with improvements in reasoning, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed shuffling-based learning framework provides a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance robust cross-modal alignment in LMMs, yielding SoTA results and improved capability in reasoning and instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

### [10] [Effect of Data Augmentation on Conformal Prediction for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14266)
*Rizwan Ahamed,Annahita Amireskandari,Joel Palko,Carol Laxson,Binod Bhattarai,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data augmentation choices materially affect conformal prediction reliability for DR grading; Mixup and CutMix boost coverage efficiency and accuracy, while CLAHE can harm certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical deployment requires reliable uncertainty; conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free guarantees, but standard training practices like data augmentation may affect these guarantees. This study investigates how augmentation impacts CP performance in DR grading.

Method: Evaluate on the DDR dataset using two backbones (ResNet-50 and CoaT) across five augmentation regimes (no augmentation, standard geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, CutMix). Assess CP metrics: empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency.

Result: Sample-mixing augmentations (Mixup, CutMix) improve predictive accuracy and yield more reliable and efficient CP estimates (better coverage with smaller set sizes). CLAHE can reduce model certainty and negatively impact CP validity. Overall, augmentation choice influences the validity and efficiency of CP in DR grading.

Conclusion: Co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in mind. To build trustworthy medical imaging AI with CP guarantees, prefer augmentation like Mixup/CutMix over CLAHE, and systematically consider their impact on CP metrics during model development.

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

*Said Djafar Said,Torkan Gholamalizadeh,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conditional diffusion model for 3D dental volume synthesis guided by tooth-level attributes, enabling precise tooth addition/removal and dentition editing with high fidelity and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental CBCT generation requires anatomically accurate, controllable 3D synthesis for planning, communication, and data augmentation; existing methods lack fine-grained control over tooth presence and arrangement.

Method: A novel 3D conditional diffusion framework using wavelet-based denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions guided by tooth-level binary attributes to focus learning on relevant structures and support paired and distributional evaluation.

Result: High-fidelity 3D dental volumes with low FID scores, robust inpainting, and SSIM > 0.91 on unseen scans; effective for tooth addition/removal and full dentition synthesis.

Conclusion: Enables realistic, localized dentition modification without rescanning, benefiting surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data augmentation; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

### [12] [GALA: Guided Attention with Language Alignment for Open Vocabulary Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14278)
*Elena Alegret Regalado,Kunyi Li,Sen Wang,Siyun Liang,Michael Niemeyer,Stefano Gasperini,Nassir Navab,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GALA proposes open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding via 3D Gaussian Splatting, using self-supervised contrastive learning to distill a scene-specific 3D feature field and a cross-attention module with two codebooks for view-independent semantic embeddings, enabling seamless 2D/3D open-vocabulary queries with lower memory than per-Gaussian features; validated on real datasets with strong open-vocabulary performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations derived from 2D images; existing methods struggle with generalization to open-vocabulary queries and memory efficiency.

Method: Self-supervised contrastive learning to distill a scene-specific 3D instance feature field; cross-attention with two learnable codebooks encoding view-independent semantic embeddings; avoids per-Gaussian high-dimensional features; leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Result: Extensive experiments show remarkable open-vocabulary performance in both 2D and 3D on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GALA enables efficient, open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by combining 3DGS with cross-attention codebooks, achieving language-aware representation while reducing memory and enabling cross-domain queries.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

### [13] [Multi-Rationale Explainable Object Recognition via Contrastive Conditional Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14280)
*Ali Rasekh,Sepehr Kazemi Ranjbar,Simon Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for explainable object recognition with multiple rationales and a training-free Contrastive Conditional Inference (CCI) framework that leverages image embeddings, labels, and rationales to improve accuracy and rationale quality in CLIP-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based conditioning in CLIP is limited by the CLIP text encoder and provides weak control over explanatory structures, while existing datasets typically offer a single, noisy rationale. There is a need for richer evaluation and reliance-free conditioning that can exploit multiple discriminative image features.

Method: Introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark with images annotated by multiple ground-truth rationales. Propose Contrastive Conditional Inference (CCI), a probabilistic framework that models relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and multiple rationales. Importantly, CCI requires no training and enables effective conditioning on rationales for category prediction.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-rationale benchmark, including strong zero-shot results, with improvements in both classification accuracy and rationale quality.

Conclusion: The benchmark and CCI framework together establish a more complete framework for evaluating explainable object recognition and set a new standard for future research; code will be released.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccluNet is a spatio-temporal model that fuses YOLOX with transformer-based temporal attention to detect occlusions in DSA sequences during EVT, achieving high precision and recall and surpassing frame-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, timely occlusion detection in digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is difficult due to complex anatomy and rapid decision-making in acute ischemic stroke. Automated occlusion detection could aid endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).

Method: OCcluNet extends YOLOX with transformer-based temporal attention to exploit temporal coherence in DSA frames. It explores two spatio-temporal variants: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention, and compares against YOLOv11 baselines trained on individual frames or minimum intensity projections.

Result: On DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry, OccluNet achieved precision 89.02% and recall 74.87%, outperforming baseline models. Both attention variants yielded similar performance.

Conclusion: OccluNet demonstrates that integrating single-shot detectors with temporal attention can effectively capture temporally consistent occlusion features in DSA sequences, with robust performance across attention variants; the code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

*Yuguang Yue,Chris Green,Samuel Hunt,Irakli Salia,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2P0.1 is a foundation model that learns to play a broad range of 3D games from pixel inputs via behavior cloning, combining labeled demonstrations with unlabeled videos and imputing actions with an inverse-dynamics model. It uses a decoder-only transformer to output autoregressive actions, enabling scalable, latency-friendly play on consumer hardware. Qualitative results show competent play on Roblox and MS-DOS games; ablations on unlabeled data; and a path toward expert-level, text-conditioned control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for agents that operate on the same pixel stream as players and generalize across titles with minimal game-specific engineering. Applications include AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, and assistive testers, which motivates building a foundation model capable of broad, zero-/few-shot adaptation to new games.

Method: End-to-end behavior cloning from labeled human gameplay demonstrations augmented with unlabeled public videos. Actions for unlabeled data are imputed via an inverse-dynamics model. The model uses a decoder-only transformer with autoregressive action output to handle large action spaces while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU.

Result: Qualitative evidence of competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, along with ablations on the contribution of unlabeled data. The paper outlines scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level performance with text-conditioned control.

Conclusion: P2P0.1 demonstrates the feasibility of training a broad game-playing foundation model directly from pixel streams with minimal game-specific engineering, and sketches concrete paths for scaling, evaluation, and achieving expert-level, text-conditioned control.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

*Guile Wu,David Huang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified diffusion transformer enabling multi-modal (RGB, depth, semantic) and multi-view video generation for autonomous driving, with modal-shared and modal-specific components, achieving superior results on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current work either focuses on RGB video or uses separate models for each modality, increasing deployment difficulty and missing cross-modal cues. A unified, controllable framework is needed to synthesize coherent multi-modal, multi-view driving scenes that leverage complementary signals and simplify deployment.

Method: Introduce a unified diffusion transformer that comprises modal-shared and modal-specific components. Use diverse conditioning inputs to encode scene structure and content into the diffusion model, enabling multi-modal multi-view video generation within a single framework.

Result: On nuScenes, the method generates high-fidelity, controllable multi-modal multi-view driving videos, outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical, scalable solution for multi-modal video synthesis in autonomous driving, enabling better holistic scene understanding and easier deployment; it paves the way for richer data generation for training and evaluation.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [17] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an inter-class relational loss (ICR) to boost small object gradient updates in IoU-based losses by exploiting inter-class spatial relationships, demonstrated on license-plate detection with a new SVMLP dataset, and showing improvements on two detectors with no extra hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based losses often produce extremely flat gradients for small objects, hindering their learning during multi-object updates. The authors propose leveraging spatial relations between objects to guide small-object learning without sacrificing overall training efficiency.

Method: Propose ICR loss that imposes a punishment when a predicted small object's box lies outside its related larger object, with a penalty inversely proportional to the overlap between the larger object and the small object. Extend this idea with a new SVMLP dataset for license-plate detection and demonstrate that ICR can be added to existing IoU-based losses to enhance performance. Validate on YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, reporting improvements.

Result: mAP@50 gains of 10.3% for YOLOv12-T and 1.6% for UAV-DETR on the proposed setting, without additional hyperparameter tuning; dataset and code to be released.

Conclusion: ICR loss effectively guides small-object predictions using larger-object context, is simple to integrate with current IoU-based losses, and, with the SVMLP dataset, demonstrates meaningful performance gains in license-plate detection scenarios.

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

*Sean Fletcher,Gabby Scott,Douglas Currie,Xin Zhang,Yuqi Song,Bruce MacLeod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A publicly released microscopy image dataset of C6 glioma cells treated with Taxol, paired with a ResAttention-KNN baseline for Taxol concentration classification using ResNet-50, CBAM attention, and k-NN in embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated, high-throughput, real-time assessment of cellular responses to Taxol and address the lack of public datasets for Taxol-induced morphological analysis.

Method: Construct a microscopy image dataset of C6 glioma cells exposed to varying Taxol concentrations. Propose ResAttention-KNN, a baseline model that integrates ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) and uses a non-parametric k-NN classifier in the learned embeddings for Taxol concentration classification.

Result: Public dataset and implementation released to support reproducibility. The proposed baseline demonstrates the value of attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification for robust Taxol concentration classification and sets a benchmark for future studies.

Conclusion: The work enables automated, high-throughput morphological analysis of Taxol response and provides resources to advance vision-based biomedical analysis; ResAttention-KNN offers a strong, interpretable baseline for future research.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

### [20] [Learning Point Cloud Representations with Pose Continuity for Depth-Based Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14358)
*Zhujun Li,Shuo Zhang,Ioannis Stamos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRC-Pose is a depth-only, category-level 6D pose estimation method that enforces continuous pose representations via contrastive learning, by decoupling rotation and translation and using a pose-aware hierarchical ranking across categories; it achieves real-time performance and outperforms depth-only SOTA on REAL275 and CAMERA25.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current category-level pose estimators rely on 6D poses as supervision and neglect the intrinsic continuity of poses, causing inconsistencies and poor generalization to unseen poses. A continuous pose representation is needed to improve accuracy and robustness across categories and views.

Method: A depth-only framework that decouples rotation and translation embeddings. It employs multi-task, multi-category contrastive learning with a 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking that contrasts point clouds across categories incorporating rotational differences, translational differences, and category information. Pose estimation modules then separately process rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings to predict 6D pose and 3D size.

Result: HRC-Pose learns continuous feature spaces for pose, and experiments on REAL275 and CAMERA25 show consistent outperformance over existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods, with real-time inference.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that encoding pose continuity in a depth-only, multi-category contrastive framework is effective for accurate and real-time category-level pose estimation, with strong potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

### [21] [Taming Transformer for Emotion-Controllable Talking Face Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14359)
*Ziqi Zhang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an emotion-controllable talking-face generation method using discrete tokens and two pre-training steps. It disentangles audio, quantizes video into visual tokens, introduces an emotion-anchor (EA) to fuse emotion into tokens, and uses an autoregressive transformer to model token distribution under emotion-conditioned audio, achieving state-of-the-art results on MEAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is to synthesize expressive, identity-preserving talking-face videos conditioned on emotion and audio. The main challenges are modeling the complex multimodal relationships between audio, emotion, and visual identity, and translating that into controllable, high-quality video generation.

Method: 1) Two pre-training strategies to disentangle audio into independent components and to quantize videos into combinations of visual tokens. 2) Introduction of an emotion-anchor (EA) representation that integrates emotional information into visual tokens. 3) An autoregressive transformer that models the global distribution of visual tokens under given conditions and predicts the index sequence to synthesize manipulated videos.

Result: Experiments on the MEAD dataset, with emotion-conditioned audios, show extensive qualitative and quantitative improvements over baselines, demonstrating the method’s effectiveness in emotion-controllable talking-face generation.

Conclusion: The proposed discrete-token framework with EA and autoregressive modeling effectively captures emotion-conditioned speaking-face generation, enabling identity-preserving, emotionally controllable video synthesis with superior performance.

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized, vehicle-focused multi-object tracking framework with occlusion-aware Re-ID and road-structure-aware tracklet refinement, plus a new vehicle benchmark; achieves strong results on MOT17/20 and the new dataset; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOT systems are largely pedestrian-centric and struggle to generalize to other object types; complex traffic scenes require robust identity preservation under occlusion and exploitation of semantic scene priors; a generalizable framework and a vehicle-focused benchmark are needed.

Method: Two main components: (1) occlusion-aware re-identification to preserve identities for heavily occluded objects, (2) road-structure-aware tracklet refinement using semantic scene priors (lane directions, crosswalks, road boundaries) to improve trajectory continuity; plus a new frame-level vehicle benchmark dataset for evaluation; reported on multiple public benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments show robust performance on the new dataset and public benchmarks; achieves strong HOTA scores on MOT17 (66.4) and MOT20 (65.7); code and dataset are publicly available.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective general-purpose multi-class tracking applicable beyond pedestrian tracking, with competitive performance on standard MOT benchmarks and valuable new dataset/code for vehicle-focused tracking research.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

*Runshi Zhang,Bimeng Jie,Yang He,Junchen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) for dense face-bone point-cloud transformations in orthognathic planning; introduces LIA-Net and an auxiliary deformable-registration-inspired loss; achieves state-of-the-art results with end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional biomechanical simulations (slow, labor-intensive, low accuracy) and the shortcomings of prior deep-learning surrogates (difficulty handling large-scale point clouds, limited receptive fields, reliance on heavy preprocessing/registration).

Method: A two-stage architecture: stage 1 uses a Transformer-based network to capture global correspondences between facial and skeletal point clouds; stage 2 employs a Local Information Aggregation Network (LIA-Net) to refine local geometry and displacements. Global features guide local displacement via a gated recurrent unit. An auxiliary loss, inspired by deformable medical image registration, leverages expert knowledge to reconstruct critical organs. End-to-end learning with a focus on learning patch- and point-level correspondences for dense transformations.

Result: Reported state-of-the-art performance on collected datasets, with strong evaluation metrics and clear visualizations; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: TCFNet delivers accurate, scalable, end-to-end dense face-bone transformations for surgical planning, mitigating reliance on registration-heavy preprocessing and enabling improved clinical applicability.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Hong-Gi Shin,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Augment pose-code latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization to improve expressiveness and controllability in text-to-motion generation; achieves improved FID and R-Precision on HumanML3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete pose codes alone fail to capture fine-grained, high-frequency motion details, limiting controllability and realism.

Method: Integrate residual vector quantization with pose-code latents to add continuous motion information while preserving interpretability; uses RVQ to encode residuals and combine with pose codes.

Result: On HumanML3D, FID improves from 0.041 to 0.015; Top-1 R-Precision improves from 0.508 to 0.510; qualitative analysis confirms enhanced controllability for motion editing via pairwise pose-code direction similarity.

Conclusion: RVQ augmentation preserves interpretability while increasing motion detail capture, enabling more expressive and controllable text-to-motion systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadINR introduces piecewise quadratic activation functions for implicit neural representations (INRs), delivering hardware-efficient inference with improved expressivity. It achieves notable PSNR gains on images/videos while dramatically reducing area, power, and latency on FPGA/ASIC implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spectral bias in INRs without incurring heavy hardware overhead from complex activation functions; enable efficient, scalable hardware implementations.

Method: Propose piecewise quadratic active functions that embed rich harmonic content; support a unified N-stage pipeline for hardware-friendly AFs; validate via Neural Tangent Kernel analysis; implement on FPGA (VCU128) and ASIC (28nm); evaluate on image/video tasks.

Result: Reported up to 2.06 dB PSNR improvement over baselines; hardware area ~1914 μm^2; dynamic power ~6.14 mW; up to 97% reductions in resources/power; latency improved up to 93% compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: QuadINR demonstrates that hardware-efficient piecewise quadratic AFs can boost INR expressivity (via richer Fourier content) and deliver substantial hardware savings, with a general pipeline that can accommodate other AFs and shows strong empirical gains on practical datasets.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by
up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

TL;DR: A novel fusion approach for 6D pose estimation dataset creation for marine vessels by integrating YOLOX-X detections with AIS data, using PnP for alignment, yielding BONK-pose dataset; achieves competitive detection performance and provides a new dataset without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  AIS data reliability issues (equipment failures, manipulation, delays) motivate a data-driven method to obtain accurate 6D poses by fusing visual detections with AIS, enabling robust maritime perception datasets.

Method: Fuse monocular RGB detections (YOLOX-X) with AIS messages to generate 3D bounding boxes representing 6D pose; compare homography and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) for aligning AIS data with image coordinates; evaluate multiple vessel detectors; release BONK-pose dataset (3753 images with 3D bounding boxes) and an additional 1000-image 2D bbox dataset.

Result: PnP yields significantly lower projection error than homography; YOLOX-X achieves mAP 0.80 at IoU 0.5 for relevant vessel classes; BONK-pose contains 3753 images with 3D bounding box annotations; an extra 1000 images with 2D bounding boxes for ship detection.

Conclusion: Data fusion enables 6D pose dataset creation without manual annotation; BONK-pose provides a public resource for training/evaluating 6D pose networks; the approach improves alignment accuracy and could enhance vessel localization and pose estimation in practice.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

*Junchao Zhu,Ruining Deng,Junlin Guo,Tianyuan Yao,Juming Xiong,Chongyu Qu,Mengmeng Yin,Yu Wang,Shilin Zhao,Haichun Yang,Daguang Xu,Yucheng Tang,Yuankai Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, dense high-resolution ST generation framework (Img2ST-Net) that uses a fully convolutional model and super-pixel representations to predict HD spatial transcriptomics from histology images, paired with a new SSIM-ST metric for robust evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (e.g., 8 μm) is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Traditional spot-by-spot regression becomes inefficient and unstable at HD scales, compounded by extreme data sparsity and low expression levels. There is a need for scalable, accurate, and resolution-aware models that can predict dense HD ST maps from histology.

Method: Img2ST-Net uses a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense HD gene expression maps in parallel. It models HD ST data as super-pixel representations and reframes image-to-omics inference as a super-content image generation problem with hundreds to thousands of output channels. It also introduces SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis.

Result: Proposes a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction that improves computational efficiency and preserves spatial organization. Provides dense HD ST maps and a new evaluation metric (SSIM-ST) for sparse expression patterns; code released at the project repository.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net offers a principled, scalable solution for efficient and accurate HD ST inference at scale, laying groundwork for next-generation resolution-aware spatial-omics modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

TL;DR: A new open-world platform, Virtual Community, enables study of embodied social intelligence among humans, robots, and society, featuring a multi-agent physics simulator and a large-scale real-world aligned environment, and proposing two challenges: Community Planning and Community Robot Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and shape the coexistence of humans and robots in shared open-world settings as AI and robotics advance, requiring scalable, realistic platforms to study social interaction, planning, cooperation, and competition.

Method: An open-source multi-agent physics simulator supporting humans, robots, and their interactions; a large-scale pipeline to generate real-world aligned communities (outdoor spaces, diverse indoor scenes, grounded agents with rich appearances); two challenges (Community Planning and Community Robot Challenge) with baseline evaluations to illustrate task requirements.

Result: Baseline evaluations on both challenges show the platform can reveal high-level open-world planning and low-level cooperative control challenges, demonstrating feasibility and highlighting research directions.

Conclusion: Virtual Community offers a scalable open-world platform to advance research on human-robot coexistence, enabling study of cooperative/competitive behaviors, social relationship formation, and community dynamics in realistic environments.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

### [29] [CTA-Flux: Integrating Chinese Cultural Semantics into High-Quality English Text-to-Image Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14405)
*Yue Gong,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Jian Zhu,Bo Cheng,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Yuhang Ma,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CTA-Flux, a lightweight Chinese semantics adapter for Flux via MMDiT that enables Chinese prompts without heavy retraining, improving quality and cultural authenticity while staying compatible with existing TTI plugins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux, trained mainly on English data, struggles with non-English prompts due to linguistic and cultural biases. Translation or bilingual finetuning inadequately preserves culturally specific semantics. A direct, efficient bridge is needed to preserve image authenticity for Chinese prompts.

Method: Use MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone, reducing parameter count, enabling direct Chinese semantic control, and avoiding full-model retraining. Maintains compatibility with LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet.

Result: Empirical evaluations show CTA-flux improves image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics for both Chinese and English prompts, while remaining compatible with existing text-to-image plugins.

Conclusion: CTA-Flux provides a scalable approach to bridge Chinese semantics with English-centric diffusion models, enabling higher-quality, culturally faithful multilingual text-to-image generation with minimal retraining; potential for extension to other languages and model families.

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

### [30] [MoCHA-former: Moiré-Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer for Video Demoiréing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14423)
*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer-based demoiréing framework (MoCHA-former) for camera-based screen capture, using decoupled moiré/content separation and spatio-temporal adaptation to address spatially varying, large-scale, channel-dependent, and temporally fluctuating moiré patterns; achieves superior results on RAW and sRGB video datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moiré patterns from the camera's color filter array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels degrade captured photos and videos; existing demoiréing models struggle with spatially varying artifact strength, large-scale structures, channel-dependent statistics, and rapid temporal fluctuations.

Method: MoCHA-former comprises two components: Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoir’ing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir’ing (STAD). DMAD uses a Moiré Decoupling Block (MDB) and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB) to separate moiré from content, followed by a Moiré Conditioning Block (MCB) to produce moiré-adaptive features. STAD introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture large-scale structures and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel dependence in RAW frames, plus implicit frame alignment for temporal consistency.

Result: Evaluated on two video datasets spanning RAW and sRGB domains; MoCHA-former consistently outperforms prior methods in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Conclusion: MoCHA-former effectively addresses moiré in camera-based screen capture via spatial-temporal adaptive demoiréing and decoupling, achieving robust performance and temporal coherence, with strong potential for portable imaging pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

*Bing Han,Yuhua Huang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperDiff combines diffusion models with HyperGCN to tackle monocular 3D HPE, addressing depth ambiguity and occlusion via diffusion-based uncertainty modeling and denoising with multi-granularity hyper-graph convolutions to capture high-order joint correlations. It achieves state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP and supports resource-aware trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The monocular 3D HPE task suffers from depth ambiguity and occlusion during 2D-to-3D lifting, and traditional skeleton-based methods often miss multi-scale joint correlations, limiting accuracy.

Method: Integrate a diffusion model (to capture data uncertainty and alleviate depth/occlusion issues) with HyperGCN acting as a denoiser that uses multi-granularity skeleton structures to model high-order inter-joint relationships, yielding the HyperDiff framework.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with the model able to adapt to different computational budgets to balance performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperDiff effectively leverages diffusion-based uncertainty modeling and multi-scale HyperGCN denoising to improve monocular 3D HPE accuracy, handling depth ambiguity and occlusion while enabling flexible resource-aware deployment.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

*Gabriel Tjio,Jie Zhang,Xulei Yang,Yun Xing,Nhat Chung,Xiaofeng Cao,Ivor W. Tsang,Chee Keong Kwoh,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a diffusion-guided, frequency-aware input adaptation method that uses a lightweight Y-FPN and FrequencyMix to preserve task-relevant information while adapting to domain shifts, achieving strong robustness for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation and enabling pseudo-label-based supervision to mitigate forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts during test-time adaptation can degrade task performance and cause forgetting of task-relevant knowledge; robust, efficient adaptation that preserves semantics is needed for dense prediction under evolving domains.

Method: Diffusion-driven denoising conditioned on learned spatial frequency priors; a lightweight Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) to separate high/low frequencies; FrequencyMix data augmentation to diversify frequency perturbations; pseudo-labels derived from FOCUS-denoised images to provide extra supervision; designed for efficiency in a diffusion framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art averaged performance across 15 corruptions on semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation over 3 datasets; can complement existing adaptation methods via pseudo-label supervision; reduces catastrophic forgetting under limited supervision.

Conclusion: Frequency-based conditioning in diffusion-driven input adaptation effectively preserves semantics while adapting to domain shifts, yielding strong robustness for dense prediction tasks and enabling integration with other adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task requires simultaneous precise spatial control of multiple subjects and faithful identity preservation, which current models struggle to achieve in a unified end-to-end framework.

Method: Introduce MUSE, which uses concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to align layout specifications with textual guidance through explicit semantic space expansion, and a progressive two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable sub-objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing methods; code and model are released on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUSE advances controllable image synthesis by integrating layout-driven constraints with subject synthesis, enabling simultaneous spatial precision and identity preservation in multi-subject generation.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: Agricultural scenes have uneven illumination, occlusions, and limited field-of-view, which hinder existing 3D Gaussian splatting approaches. Incorporating near-infrared data and textual vegetation indices can improve robustness and provide richer botanical context.

Method: NIRPlant provides multimodal data (NIR, RGB, Depth, LiDAR, textual metadata like NDVI/NDWI/chlorophyll index). NIRSplat fuses modalities with a cross-attention mechanism and 3D point-based positional encoding to enforce strong geometric priors for Gaussian splatting.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show NIRSplat outperforms existing methods (3DGS, CoR-GS, InstantSplat) in challenging agricultural scenarios, demonstrating robustness to lighting variations and occlusions.

Conclusion: The work delivers a practical multimodal framework and dataset for agricultural 3D reconstruction, enabling richer insights beyond the visible spectrum; code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalizability of engagement estimation models across diverse domains and cultural/linguistic contexts while capturing complex interaction dynamics.

Method: Introduce Domain Prompting by prepending learnable domain vectors to inputs; implement a Parallel Cross-Attention module to align reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM) states between participants.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-cultural and cross-linguistic benchmarks; reports an absolute CCC improvement of 0.45 on NoXi-J; won first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at MultiMediate'25.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive prompting combined with interactional synchrony modeling yields robust generalization in engagement estimation and sets new benchmarks, with demonstrated cross-domain effectiveness.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at

*Yuhang Guo,Kaijun Deng,Siyang Song,Jindong Xie,Wenhui Ma,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D^3-Talker introduces decoupled deformation fields based on a static 3D Gaussian attribute field to enable high-quality, data-efficient 3D talking head synthesis with accurate lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need to train new target identities from limited data by separating out generic audio-driven lip cues from identity-specific facial motion, reducing reliance on lengthy per-identity videos. Audio alone often contains non-lip information that hinders realistic lip motion when data is scarce.

Method: Construct a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and use two independent Gaussian deformation fields controlled separately by audio and Facial Motion signals to decouple general and personalized deformations. Introduce a similarity contrastive loss during pre-training to enhance decoupling. Add a Coarse-to-Fine refinement module to reduce blur from head motion and improve image quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show D^3-Talker achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization with limited training data.

Conclusion: D^3-Talker effectively tackles data efficiency and lip-sync challenges in 3D talking head synthesis by decoupling general and personalized deformations and employing targeted pre-training and refinement techniques.

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Two single-step diffusion models for forward and inverse rendering with cycle-consistency, enabling fast, coherent rendering and video decomposition across indoor/outdoor scenes, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cycle inconsistency and slow inference in multi-step diffusion-based forward/inverse rendering by coupling the two tasks with mutual reinforcement.

Method: Ouroboros framework using two single-step diffusion models for forward and inverse rendering, a cycle-consistency mechanism between the outputs, extension of intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes, and a training-free transfer to video decomposition.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes with substantially faster inference than other diffusion-based methods; reduces temporal inconsistency in video sequences while preserving high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Conclusion: Mutual reinforcement between forward and inverse rendering with cycle-consistency yields coherent, fast rendering and enables training-free video decomposition transfer.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

*Weitao Wang,Zichen Wang,Hongdeng Shen,Yulei Lu,Xirui Fan,Suhui Wu,Jun Zhang,Haoqian Wang,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamSwapV proposes a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework for video subject swapping using a user-provided mask and reference image, with an adaptive mask strategy and a dedicated condition fusion module to integrate multiple guidance signals, evaluated on a DreamSwapV-Benchmark and VBench indicators where it reportedly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods for swapping subjects are domain-limited or rely on indirect editing prompts, leading to lower fidelity and controllability. There is a need for a general, user-guided, high-quality solution that can swap any subject in any video with fine-grained control.

Method: Introduce DreamSwapV, an end-to-end architecture that uses a mask-guided approach and a multi-condition fusion module to incorporate user mask, reference image, and other guidance signals. An adaptive mask strategy handles subjects of varying scales and attributes. A two-phase dataset construction and training scheme is employed to enable robust learning, culminating in a DreamSwapV-Benchmark for evaluation.

Result: DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods on VBench indicators and on the authors’ DreamSwapV-Benchmark, demonstrating improved fidelity and control in subject-swapping tasks across diverse videos and subjects.

Conclusion: A versatile, user-guided, end-to-end framework for video subject swapping is feasible with mask-guided conditioning and adaptive masking, achieving state-of-the-art results on established benchmarks and a new benchmark, while enabling flexible customization.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

*Boxiao Pan,Adam W. Harley,C. Karen Liu,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Predicts future 6D head poses from egocentric video using temporally aggregated 3D latent features; introduces Aria Navigation Dataset (AND) with 4 hours of real-world navigation data; demonstrates human-like navigation behaviors and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Important for collision-free planning and assistive navigation; data-poor domain; need to model active head-turning and information gathering in egocentric navigation.

Method: A framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D latent features to model static/dynamic environment constraints; predicts head translations and rotations; builds a data collection pipeline with Project Aria and releases AND dataset.

Result: Model exhibits human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting, slowing, rerouting, and looking around for traffic; generalizes to unseen environments; provides resource for learning real-world egocentric navigation policies.

Conclusion: Proposes a viable approach and dataset for learning future head-pose trajectories in egocentric settings, enabling more realistic and transferable navigation policies.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

*Haoran Bai,Xiaoxu Chen,Canqian Yang,Zongyao He,Sibin Deng,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vivid-VR is a DiT-based video restoration framework that uses a T2V foundation and novel ControlNet designs with concept distillation to preserve texture and temporal coherence while maintaining content control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable video generation fine-tuning suffers from distribution drift due to imperfect multimodal alignment, harming texture realism and temporal consistency.

Method: Propose concept distillation training using pretrained T2V to synthesize samples with embedded textual concepts; redesign control architecture with a control feature projector to filter degraded input latents; introduce a dual-branch ControlNet connector combining MLP feature mapping and cross-attention for dynamic control feature retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments show Vivid-VR outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real benchmarks and AIGC videos, achieving strong texture realism, vividness, and temporal coherence; code and checkpoints released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: The approach effectively preserves texture and temporal quality while maintaining content consistency, demonstrating superior controllable video restoration performance.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Conclusion: WeedSense demonstrates strong multi-task performance and efficiency, enabling real-time weed management. The model's ability to leverage shared representations across tasks suggests robustness and practicality for precision agriculture; future work may explore generalization to more species, environments, and deployment considerations.

Abstract: Weed management represents a critical challenge in agriculture, significantly
impacting crop yields and requiring substantial resources for control.
Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing
sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We
introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive
weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation,
and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed
species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATURN is a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates scene graphs into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while only fine-tuning the VAR transformer, yielding large gains on Visual Genome without extra modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object layout and relational fidelity in text-to-image generation by incorporating explicit scene-graph structure, addressing the bottleneck of prior graph-guided methods which relied on heavy GAN/diffusion pipelines and lag behind autoregressive models.

Method: Introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), which converts a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence fed into a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone; only the VAR transformer is fine-tuned on top of this while leveraging a fixed visual backbone, enabling efficient, graph-informed generation.

Result: On Visual Genome, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming SG2IM and SGDiff without extra modules or multi-stage training.

Conclusion: SATURN successfully imparts structural awareness to state-of-the-art autoregressive generation, achieving substantial quality gains with a lightweight, end-to-end training setup that preserves fidelity and speed.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

*Bernd Hofmann,Albert Scheck,Joerg Franke,Patrick Bruendl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PB-IAD uses prompt-based prompts and GPT-4.1 to enable industrial anomaly detection in data-sparse settings, achieving superior performance against PatchCore in low-shot scenarios through semantic instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection struggles with data sparsity, dynamic production conditions, and reliance on annotated datasets. Foundation models’ multimodal reasoning offers a flexible, user-centric path to adapt this task without extensive data science expertise.

Method: Introduce PB-IAD with a prompt template and a pre-processing module that converts domain user inputs into effective system prompts. Leverage GPT-4.1 across three manufacturing scenarios and two data modalities, plus an ablation study to quantify the contribution of semantic instructions. Benchmark against state-of-the-art methods like PatchCore.

Result: PB-IAD achieves superior performance, especially in data-sparse and low-shot settings, driven by semantic instructions alone. The ablation study confirms the positive impact of semantic prompts. Benchmark comparisons show competitive or better results than PatchCore.

Conclusion: A data-efficient, adaptable, and domain-user-centric approach to industrial anomaly detection is feasible with prompt-based interactions with foundation models, enabling domain experts to customize detection without deep data science expertise.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

### [44] [Adversarial Generation and Collaborative Evolution of Safety-Critical Scenarios for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14527)
*Jiangfan Liu,Yongkang Guo,Fangzhi Zhong,Tianyuan Zhang,Zonglei Jing,Siyuan Liang,Jiakai Wang,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenGE generates diverse, safety-critical driving scenarios by first using a knowledge-grounded language model to infer adversarial agents (Meta-Scenario Generation) and then amplifies them with complex traffic flows via an adversarial collaborator graph (Complex Scenario Evolution); this yields more severe collisions and robust AV models compared to baselines, across simulators and in real tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety testing for autonomous vehicles relies on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which miss diverse and unforeseen failure modes. There is a need for scalable methods to generate plausible yet challenging adversarial scenarios to rigorously evaluate and improve AV safety before deployment.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Meta-Scenario Generation uses a structured driving knowledge-grounded LLM to infer an adversarial agent whose behavior is plausible and challenging, translating the scenario into executable in-simulator code. (2) Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles and an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key trajectories and optimize perturbations that shrink the ego vehicle's maneuver space and create occlusions. The approach is evaluated on multiple RL-based AV models across different simulators, shows improved exposure to severe collisions (+31.96% vs SOTA baselines), and is validated on large-model AV systems, real-world vehicle tests, and human evaluation.

Result: ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than state-of-the-art baselines. Adversarial training using these scenarios improves robustness of AV models. The method generalizes to large-model AV systems and multiple simulators and is corroborated by real-world tests and human evaluations, confirming plausibility and criticality of generated scenarios.

Conclusion: ScenGE represents a scalable, plausible framework for safety scenario generation that enhances AV evaluation and robustness, potentially increasing public trust and facilitating safer deployment across diverse simulators and real-world settings.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

### [45] [WISE-FUSE: Efficient Whole Slide Image Encoding via Coarse-to-Fine Patch Selection with VLM and LLM Knowledge Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14537)
*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE offers adaptive WSI encoding by selecting diagnostically relevant regions using cross-modal similarity with textual prompts, reducing encoding time by >3x while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gigapixel nature of WSIs makes exhaustive high-resolution encoding computationally prohibitive, creating a bottleneck for real-world deployment. A scalable encoding approach that preserves diagnostic features is needed.

Method: Compute similarity between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge-distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features; select a subset of informative regions; encode high-resolution patches selectively; fuse with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context using pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models.

Result: WSI encoding time is reduced by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing exhaustive patch processing.

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE provides a scalable, practical solution for computational pathology by adaptive region selection and multimodal fusion to alleviate the WSI encoding bottleneck.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

TL;DR: Unsupervised OCR refinement by exploiting document-level redundancy via an extended GMM with EM and intra-cluster realignment; improves outputs on degraded historical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCR on printed, degraded documents suffers from high inter-domain variability; there is redundancy within a document that can be leveraged to fix imperfect outputs without labeled data.

Method: An extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that alternates Expectation-Maximization with an intra-cluster realignment process and normality testing, enabling unsupervised correction of OCR outputs within a document.

Result: Demonstrates improvements on degraded datasets including recovered Uruguayan military archives and 17th–mid-20th century European newspapers.

Conclusion: Document-level redundancy is a valuable unsupervised signal for correcting OCR and improving clustering, particularly under degradation.

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High spatial resolution remote sensing enables automated agricultural parcel inventory; there is a need to synthesize and map existing APBD research to guide future work.

Method: Systematic review of recent APBD papers; meta-data analysis (algorithm, study site, crop type, sensor, evaluation); categorize into three classes: traditional image processing, traditional ML, deep learning; further subdivide DL into semantic segmentation, object detection, Transformer-based; discuss multi-sensor/data fusion, single-task vs multi-task learning, algorithm comparisons; propose future applications and topics.

Result: A knowledge map or comprehensive review of APBD literature; quantifies trends and methods; identifies gaps and hot topics; provides guidance for researchers.

Conclusion: The review helps researchers track APBD development and tendencies and highlights promising future directions in APBD research.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

### [48] [Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14562)
*Sujin Jeon,Hyundo Lee,Eungseo Kim,Sanghack Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM) improves concept localization in label-free CBMs by using concept-specific prototypes learned via foundation-model features, yielding better spatial localization with similar accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free CBMs often struggle to localize concepts in relevant image regions; leveraging foundation-model features and prototype learning can align concept presence with spatial regions and improve interpretability.

Method: Assign one prototype per concept and train prototypes to encode prototypical local image regions. Use foundation-model features to ensure prototypes are relevant to their concepts. Use prototypes to guide the selection of the proper local regions from which each concept should be predicted, enabling locality-aware predictions. End-to-end training with evaluation of localization and classification.

Result: LCBM demonstrates improved localization and concept identification while maintaining comparable classification performance to baseline label-free CBMs.

Conclusion: Prototype-based locality alignment, guided by foundation-model features, can enhance interpretability and localization in CBMs without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

*Xingyuan Yang,Min Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage inverse rendering framework (GOGS) using 2D Gaussian surfels to robustly reconstruct geometry with physics-based rendering and priors, then decompose materials via full rendering with Monte Carlo sampling and differentiable ray tracing for high-frequency specular details, enabling realistic relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering of glossy objects is severely ill-posed due to ambiguity. NeRF-based methods offer high fidelity but are computationally expensive; 3D Gaussian Splatting is efficient but struggles with specular reflections and multi-view inconsistencies. There is a need for an efficient, physically grounded approach that yields accurate geometry and material decomposition for novel illuminations.

Method: Stage 1: Robust surface reconstruction using physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Stage 2: Material decomposition via Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination with differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing, and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding to capture anisotropic highlights.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.

Conclusion: GOGS delivers robust geometry recovery and accurate material decomposition, enabling plausible, photorealistic relighting. It combines efficient 2D Gaussian surfels with physics-based and Monte Carlo rendering to address specular and lighting ambiguities while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at
high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and
track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and
LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the
OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that
combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and

### [51] [Controllable Latent Space Augmentation for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14588)
*Sofiène Boutaj,Marin Scalbert,Pierre Marza,Florent Couzinie-Devy,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HistAug is a fast, controllable latent-space augmentation model for whole-slide image (WSI) multiple instance learning in digital pathology. It conditions on explicit patch-level transformations to generate augmented embeddings, enabling scalable augmentation across many patches with improved MIL performance, especially in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSIs are gigapixel-scale and densely labeled data are scarce. Traditional patch-level augmentation is expensive due to the vast number of patches per slide, and existing feature-space augmentations lack semantic control. A scalable, controllable latent-space augmentation can increase data diversity without costly patch extraction and preserve semantic content.

Method: HistAug is a generative model operating in the latent space conditioned on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion). It generates augmented embeddings that retain original semantic information and can process many patches in a single forward pass, enabling uniform WSI-wise augmentation and improved MIL training.

Result: HistAug outperforms existing augmentation methods across multiple slide-level tasks and organs, with pronounced gains in low-data regimes. Ablation studies show learned, transformation-based augmentation beats noise-based perturbations, and uniform WSI-wise augmentation is important for performance gains.

Conclusion: HistAug provides fast, controllable, and semantically meaningful augmentation in the latent space for WSI MIL, enabling scalable data augmentation and improved performance. The approach is validated across tasks with robust ablations, and code is publicly available.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

### [52] [Reliable Smoke Detection via Optical Flow-Guided Feature Fusion and Transformer-Based Uncertainty Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14597)
*Nitish Kumar Mahala,Muzammil Khan,Pushpendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular smoke detection using a two-phase, uncertainty-aware Shifted Windows Transformer, with flow-based motion encoding and GMM fusion; introduces a fractional-order variational optical flow, a smoke dataset, and a two-phase training strategy yielding robust early-fire detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smoke dynamics, illumination variation, and environmental noise make mono-sensor detectors unreliable; a robust monocular framework with uncertainty estimation is valuable for early fire warning without multi-sensor setups.

Method: Develop color-encoded optical flow maps via a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model, fuse with appearance cues using a Gaussian Mixture Model to produce smoke masks, and feed these representations into a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head. Training proceeds in two phases: first optimize detection accuracy, second jointly model aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties to estimate prediction plausibility.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art methods, enabling reliable early smoke detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and autonomous monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust monocular smoke-detection solution with integrated uncertainty estimation, suitable for real-world early-fire warning applications.

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

### [53] [Incremental Object Detection with Prompt-based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14599)
*Matthias Neuwirth-Trapp,Maarten Bieshaar,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-based visual IL methods struggle on incremental object detection (IOD); a practical hybrid approach that replays a small portion of past data plus visual prompts yields the best performance, with results influenced by prompt length and initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether visual-prompt-based incremental learning techniques from image classification transfer to incremental object detection, assess generalizability, and establish baselines and practical guidance for this setting.

Method: Systematically analyze three prompt-based methods in a complex domain-incremental learning setup for IOD, compare against a wide range of baselines, and study the impact of prompt length and initialization. Propose a strong practical method that combines visual prompts with replaying a small fraction of past data.

Result: Prompt-based methods underperform in the IOD IL setting, whereas the proposed hybrid method (prompts + data replay) achieves the best results among the tested approaches.

Conclusion: Visual prompts alone are insufficient for effective IL in IOD; a practical hybrid approach combining prompts with limited replay offers better performance and provides guidance on prompt length and initialization for future IL in object detection.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

### [54] [UST-SSM: Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Models for Point Cloud Video Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14604)
*Peiming Li,Ziyi Wang,Yulin Yuan,Hong Liu,Xiangming Meng,Junsong Yuan,Mengyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UST-SSM extends state-space modeling to point cloud videos by reordering points with semantic-aware STSS, aggregating spatio-temporal structure via STSA, and enhancing temporal interaction through TIS, demonstrating improved action recognition on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud videos present dynamic 3D motion but have spatio-temporal disorder that makes direct 1D unfolding for state-space models ineffective. While SSMs offer linear complexity for sequence modeling, capturing long-range spatial-temporal dependencies in unordered 3D data is challenging; thus there is a need to leverage nonlocal relations and compensate missing 4D geometry/motion details.

Method: Propose Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM) comprising: 1) Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS) to reorganize unordered points into semantic-aware sequences using prompt-guided clustering, enabling use of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar; 2) Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) to aggregate features and compensate missing 4D details; 3) Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) to improve temporal dependencies by using non-anchor frames and expanding receptive fields; integrate with SSMs for efficient sequence modeling of point cloud videos.

Result: Validated on MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets showing effectiveness; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: UST-SSM successfully extends state-space modeling to point cloud videos by addressing spatio-temporal disorder and enhancing temporal interactions, achieving competitive performance across multiple action recognition datasets; the approach is accompanied by release of code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

### [55] [SMTrack: End-to-End Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Multi-Object Tracking in RGB Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14607)
*Pengzhi Zhong,Xinzhe Wang,Dan Zeng,Qihua Zhou,Feixiang He,Shuiwang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First directly trained deep Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) on standard RGB video, SMTrack, introducing Asa-NWDLoss and TrackTrack for robust association; achieves MOT performance on par with leading ANN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap between low-power SNNs and complex temporal vision tasks on conventional RGB video; enable directly trained SNNs for MOT, addressing scale variation and data association in dynamic scenes.

Method: Proposes adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) that adjusts normalization by computing average object size per training batch to better handle small objects; uses TrackTrack identity module for stable data association; end-to-end SNN-based MOT pipeline for RGB videos.

Result: Evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show SMTrack achieves performance comparable to leading ANN-based MOT methods, demonstrating the viability of directly trained deep SNNs for challenging tracking scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the practicality of directly trained deep SNNs for complex MOT on standard RGB video, with strong potential for low-power, robust tracking and scope for future improvements in scale/density handling and data association.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing long videos requires global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of frames; existing approaches suffer from structural drift and temporal artifacts in minute-long sequences.

Method: AnchorSync decouples editing into sparse anchor-frame edits and smooth intermediate-frame interpolation. It enforces structural consistency via a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics through multimodal guidance.

Result: Experiments show the method produces coherent, high-fidelity edits and outperforms prior methods in visual quality and temporal stability for long video editing.

Conclusion: AnchorSync enables high-quality, long-term video editing by maintaining structure and temporal dynamics, addressing drift and artifacts that plague existing methods, and establishing a new baseline for long-sequence editing.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of

artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Umer Sheikh,Hassan Abid,Kevin Henry,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerSense is a training-free, end-to-end one-shot framework for personalized instance segmentation in dense images, featuring IDM and PPSM, an enhanced PerSense++ variant, and PerSense-D benchmark, achieving superior performance in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense visual scenes suffer from occlusions, background clutter, and scale variation, making personalized instance segmentation challenging; a training-free, model-agnostic approach that can adapt with exemplars is desirable.

Method: Introduce an Instance Detection Module (IDM) that uses density maps to generate instance-level candidate point prompts; a Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive thresholding and spatial gating; a feedback mechanism to automatically select effective exemplars to improve density map quality; PerSense++ adds (i) diversity-aware exemplar selection for richer density maps, (ii) a hybrid IDM combining contour and peak-based prompts for better instance separation, and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module to discard inconsistent masks via outlier analysis; and PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense images.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The PerSense family delivers a robust, training-free, model-agnostic solution for personalized segmentation in dense images, with PerSense++ offering stronger robustness in cluttered scenes and PerSense-D enabling focused evaluation of this task.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

### [58] [GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682)
*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework (GeMS) for 3D Gaussian Splatting from severely blurred images, with a blurred-input SfM (VGGSfM), MCMC-based Gaussian initialization (3DGS-MCMC), joint optimization of camera motion and Gaussian parameters, and an optional event-based deblurring refinement (GeMS-E using EDI deblurring), achieving state-of-the-art on synthetic and real data and addressing a key limitation of prior methods that require sharp inputs; potential inaccuracies remain when all inputs are extremely blurred.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the unrealistic assumption in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting and deblurring methods that sharp inputs are available for pose estimation and point cloud generation, and to handle extreme motion blur where feature correspondences fail and COLMAP-based initializations are unreliable.

Method: GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM to estimate poses and generate point clouds directly from blurred images; (2) 3DGS-MCMC to initialize the Gaussian-based scene by treating Gaussians as samples from a probability distribution (removing heuristic densification/pruning); and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters. GeMS-E adds an event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring step to feed sharper frames back into GeMS for improved reconstruction.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating robust reconstruction where traditional methods falter under severe blur, and showing improved pose estimation, point cloud generation, and overall reconstruction quality. It is claimed to be the first framework to directly address extreme motion blur within 3DGS from severely blurred inputs.

Conclusion: GeMS and GeMS-E push the boundaries of 3D Gaussian Splatting by removing the need for sharp inputs and by incorporating blurred-input SfM, probabilistic Gaussians, and event-based deblurring to achieve robust scene reconstruction under extreme motion blur; still, severe blur across all inputs can still yield residual inaccuracies.

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

### [59] [Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707)
*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-driven approach to build a general-purpose vision foundation model by unifying multiple pre-trained, domain-specific teachers in a shared latent space and applying a knowledge-preservation adapter, achieving strong performance across tasks with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-centric training for vision foundation models requires vast labeled data and compute, which is a bottleneck for many institutions. Open-source, domain-specific pretrained models contain valuable knowledge but are underutilized for creating a general-purpose VFM.

Method: - Unify multiple pre-trained teacher models into a shared latent space to mitigate distributional gaps (imbalanced transfer). - Introduce a knowledge-preservation strategy using a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base and an adapter module to integrate knowledge from other domain-specific teachers. - Aggregate and align these models to create a versatile VFM that can be fine-tuned or used across multiple downstream tasks without extensive labeled data.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks: image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a viable, data-efficient path to a general-purpose vision foundation model by leveraging existing, pre-trained teachers through joint transfer and knowledge preservation, enabling robust, transferable features for multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

### [60] [MF-LPR$^2$: Multi-Frame License Plate Image Restoration and Recognition using Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14797)
*Kihyun Na,Junseok Oh,Youngkwan Cho,Bumjin Kim,Sungmin Cho,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF-LPR2 proposes a multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework that aligns neighboring frames with optical flow, refines erroneous estimates, and aggregates frames to boost quality and recognition, introducing the RLPR dataset for evaluation and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: License plates in dash-cam imagery suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, making single-frame restoration unreliable with artifacts from pretrained priors. Exploiting temporal information across frames can improve restoration and recognition while preserving evidential content.

Method: Use a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator to align adjacent frames, detect and correct erroneous flow via spatio-temporal consistency checks, and fuse frames for restoration. Integrate the restored frames with a recognition module. Introduce RLPR, a dataset of 200 low-quality sequence pairs with high-quality pseudo ground-truth, to evaluate both restoration and recognition.

Result: MF-LPR2 outperforms eight recent restoration models on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. In recognition, it achieves 86.44% accuracy, surpassing the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the best multi-frame LPR among eleven baselines (82.55%). Ablation studies show filtering and refinement steps substantially contribute to gains.

Conclusion: The proposed frame-alignment and refinement pipeline effectively improves image quality and recognition for poor-quality LPR images while preserving evidential content. The RLPR dataset provides a realistic benchmark, and the filtering/refinement components are crucial to the performance gains.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

*Jiaxin Wei,Stefan Leutenegger,Simon Schaefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSFix3D distills diffusion priors into 3D representations to enhance novel-view synthesis in under-constrained regions; introduces GSFixer, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned with mesh and 3D Gaussians and a random mask augmentation strategy for robust unseen-view inpainting, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal scene-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting advances are hampered by extreme viewpoints and partial observations; diffusion models excel at generation but lack scene-specific awareness for accurate 3D reconstruction. A method to inject diffusion priors into 3D representations can improve fidelity in under-constrained regions while maintaining observed details.

Method: Propose GSFix3D framework that distills diffusion priors into 3D representations. Develop GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via a customized fine-tuning protocol that leverages both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to various environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods. Introduce a random mask augmentation strategy to enable plausible inpainting of missing regions, facilitating robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses.

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance with minimal scene-specific fine-tuning. Real-world tests demonstrate resilience to pose errors. Code and data will be released on the project page.

Conclusion: GSFix3D and GSFixer successfully fuse diffusion priors with 3D representations to improve fidelity in under-constrained regions, enabling robust, adaptable 3D reconstructions with limited fine-tuning and improved robustness to pose inaccuracies.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation

*Shansong Wang,Mojtaba Safari,Mingzhe Hu,Qiang Li,Chih-Wei Chang,Richard LJ Qiu,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, test-time optimization approach for medical image registration using a frozen DINOv3 encoder to optimize deformation fields in feature space, achieving strong accuracy without training on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based registration methods require large labeled datasets, hindering clinical adoption. A training-free approach aims to reduce data needs while maintaining accuracy and ensuring regular deformations.

Method: Utilize a frozen DINOv3 encoder to extract feature representations and perform test-time optimization of the deformation field directly in the feature space, avoiding any additional training.

Result:  Abdomen MR-CT: mean Dice Score (DSC) 0.790; HD95 4.9 ± 5.0; SDLogJ 0.08 ± 0.02. ACDC cardiac MRI: mean DSC 0.769; HD95 4.8; SDLogJ 0.11. Notably improves over initial alignment; competitive or best performance among baselines.

Conclusion: Operating in a compact foundation feature space at test time provides a practical and general solution for clinical registration without training data.

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

*Leila Cheshmi,Mennatullah Siam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-centric multiscale video transformer for class-agnostic segmentation in autonomous driving; detects unknown objects using motion cues without optical flow; efficient, scalable to real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical robotics require robust perception capabilities that can handle unknown objects and unseen scenarios. Traditional video segmentation relies on known training classes and may miss novel categories. Large-language-model grounding is powerful but computationally expensive for pixel-level outputs; an efficient, class-agnostic, motion-based approach is desirable.

Method: End-to-end trained video transformer with multi-stage, multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random token drop. A shared learnable memory module preserves high-resolution spatiotemporal features across scales via a memory-centric decoder, avoiding feature compression. No optical flow is used; outputs are class-agnostic segmentation. Evaluated on DAVIS'16, KITTI, Cityscapes.

Result: Consistently outperforms multiscale baselines in segmentation accuracy while reducing GPU memory footprint and run-time, indicating suitability for real-time dense prediction in safety-critical robotics.

Conclusion: The architecture demonstrates a promising direction for robust, real-time, dense prediction in autonomous driving, enabling reliable detection of unknown objects without heavy computation from LLMs or optical-flow-based methods.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

### [64] [TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814)
*Zongming Li,Lianghui Zhu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight enables high-fidelity transfer of light effects between images by disentangling content and light effects via Generative Decoupling with two diffusion models, using IC-Light, enabling customizable illumination transfer while preserving content; introduces million-scale triplet dataset; claims first method to transfer light effects across disparate images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing illumination-editing approaches struggle to simultaneously provide customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity, making practical lighting stylization difficult, especially for transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a target image. The key challenge is disentangling light effects from content due to their coupled geometry in real-world scenes.

Method: Generative Decoupling using two fine-tuned diffusion models to accurately separate image content and light effects, creating a curated million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, IC-Light is trained with these triplets, using the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.

Result: TransLight enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. The approach achieves high flexibility in illumination control and, by disentangling light effects, enables transfer of light effects across disparate images, outperforming existing methods in customization and realism.

Conclusion: TransLight presents a novel framework for high-fidelity illumination transfer, opening new directions in illumination harmonization and editing by decoupling light effects from content and enabling flexible, user-guided lighting transfer.

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

### [65] [Improved Mapping Between Illuminations and Sensors for RAW Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14730)
*Abhijith Punnappurath,Luxi Zhao,Hoang Le,Abdelrahman Abdelhamed,SaiKiran Kumar Tedla,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a first-of-its-kind RAW illumination and sensor mapping dataset using a tunable lightbox across four cameras and 18 scenes (390 illuminations), and a lightweight NN that improves illumination and sensor mapping, enabling better neural ISP training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW data are sensor- and illumination-specific; collecting diverse RAW data is costly; enabling illumination augmentation and sensor mapping reduces data-capture burden.

Method: Constructed a tunable-spectrum lightbox to capture scenes with four cameras across 390 illuminations and 18 scenes. Proposed a lightweight neural network to perform joint illumination and sensor mapping between RAW domains, trained on this dataset, and evaluated against baselines.

Result: The proposed network outperforms competing methods on RAW illumination and sensor mapping tasks; demonstrates utility by enabling improved neural ISP training.

Conclusion: Dataset and model reduce data collection burden for RAW-based learning and enable robust cross-sensor and illumination transfer, with practical impact on neural image signal processing.

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

### [66] [6-DoF Object Tracking with Event-based Optical Flow and Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14776)
*Zhichao Li,Arren Glover,Chiara Bartolozzi,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid 6-DoF pose tracking for fast-moving objects using event-based optical flow to provide high-speed velocity estimates, fused with an RGB-based global pose estimator to maintain accurate pose despite motion blur and low-frame-rate RGB data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time 6-DoF tracking of fast-moving objects is hampered by RGB camera frame-rate and motion blur. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and low latency, while RGB provides rich appearance information. A fusion aims to combine the strengths of both.

Method: Develop an event-based optical flow algorithm to measure object motion and build a 6-DoF velocity tracker. Integrate this velocity with low-frequency pose estimates from an RGB-based global pose estimator to continuously update the object's pose during high-speed motion.

Result: The approach is validated on synthetic and real-world data, showing effectiveness in high-speed motion scenarios and overcoming motion blur limitations in RGB data.

Conclusion: Fusing event-based velocity information with RGB-based pose estimation enables robust, real-time 6-DoF pose tracking of fast-moving objects, leveraging complementary sensor strengths for challenging robotics applications.

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

### [67] [Adversarial Hospital-Invariant Feature Learning for WSI Patch Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14779)
*Mengliang Zhang,Jacob M. Luber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of domain bias in pathology foundation models (PFMs) caused by hospital-specific characteristics; introduces a lightweight adversarial adapter with a gradient reversal layer to remove latent hospital features from frozen representations, improving out-of-domain generalization with preserved or enhanced disease classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs trained on whole-slide images can pick up hospital-specific scanning/preprocessing biases, risking biased models and poor generalization across institutions; a formal pipeline to quantify domain bias and effective mitigation is needed for safe clinical deployment.

Method: (1) Build a pipeline to quantify domain bias in PFMs; (2) evaluate and compare multiple models across multi-center datasets; (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that preserves the encoder while learning domain-invariant representations via a trainable adapter connected to a domain classifier through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), enabling task-discriminative yet hospital-invariant features.

Result: The approach substantially reduces hospital-domain predictability while maintaining or improving disease classification, particularly for unseen hospitals (out-of-domain). Additional analyses (hospital detection, feature-space visualization) corroborate reduced hospital bias. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that hospital bias in PFMs can be mitigated without modifying the encoder, yielding more robust, domain-invariant representations and enabling safer cross-institution deployment of PFMs.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

### [68] [Tinker: Diffusion's Gift to 3D--Multi-View Consistent Editing From Sparse Inputs without Per-Scene Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14811)
*Canyu Zhao,Xiaoman Li,Tianjian Feng,Zhiyue Zhao,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tinker is a zero-shot/few-shot 3D editing framework that uses pretrained diffusion models to achieve multi-view–consistent edits from as few as one or two images, without per-scene finetuning. It introduces a Referring multi-view editor and an Any-view-to-video synthesizer, builds a large multi-view editing dataset, and attains state-of-the-art results in editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dominant barrier in 3D editing is the need for per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency; existing methods are not scalable. There's a need for scalable zero-shot/few-shot 3D editing that leverages powerful pretrained diffusion models to gain latent 3D awareness and to produce consistent edits across views.

Method: Two novel components drive the framework: (1) Referring multi-view editor for precise, reference-driven edits coherent across viewpoints; (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer that uses spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation from sparse inputs. The approach repurposes pretrained diffusion models to induce latent 3D awareness, and it includes a large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline to support development, enabling (a) one-shot/few-shot editing without per-scene training and (b) robust multi-view consistency.

Result: Tinker delivers robust, multi-view-consistent edits from as few as one or two images, reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks.

Conclusion: Tinker represents a key step toward truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing, enabling versatile high-fidelity 3D content creation without per-scene finetuning.

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

*Haoyu Zhao,Jiaxi Gu,Shicong Wang,Xing Zhang,Hang Xu,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A resource-efficient, fine-grained video-language retrieval framework that uses coarse-to-fine objectives, a Granularity-Aware Representation module, and an inference-time voting mechanism with a Matching Entropy metric, achieving gains without extra pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on large-scale pretraining and improve fine-grained video-text alignment in video-language retrieval, addressing high training costs and the underexplored granularity of video-caption signals.

Method: Use coarse-to-fine objectives (contrastive and matching learning) complemented by a Granularity-Aware Representation (GAR) module that aligns video frames with caption words for fine-grained representations. Leverage repetition of keywords in captions. Propose an inference pipeline with a voting mechanism and a Matching Entropy metric to boost retrieval without additional pretraining.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches on four benchmarks; reported gains include 2.1% Recall@1 on MSR-VTT and 1.6% Recall@1 on DiDeMo, achieved without extra pretraining.

Conclusion: Fine-grained alignment and an efficient inference-time strategy can enhance video-language retrieval while reducing training costs; exploiting caption repetition provides additional signal, making the approach practical and effective.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

TL;DR: EventSSEG is an event-camera-based road segmentation approach that uses event-only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism, leveraging self-supervised learning to achieve state-of-the-art results with minimal labeled events on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the latency/compute limitations of frame-based road segmentation and the scarcity of labeled event data, by leveraging low-power event cameras and self-supervised learning to reduce labeling requirements.

Method: EventSSEG employs event-only computing with probabilistic attention and uses event-based self-supervised learning to bridge the gap from traditional camera models, enabling road segmentation with limited labeled events.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 with minimal labeled events.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of event cameras for road segmentation, reducing the need for extensive labeled event data and exploiting self-supervised learning to maximize event camera capabilities.

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale study shows pancreas size/shape changes with aging and in type 2 diabetes; MRI and CT yield different measurements; pancreas tends to be smaller in type 2 diabetes; provides a normative lifespan reference from non-diabetic controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how pancreas morphology evolves with age and how deviations relate to type 2 diabetes; identify reliable imaging modalities for AI-based measurement and establish normative aging trends.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 2533 clinically acquired abdominal CT/MRI scans. Scans resampled to 3 mm isotropic resolution; automated pancreas segmentation; extraction of 13 morphological features. Comparison of CT vs MRI for consistency. Normative distributions stratified by age/sex. GAMLSS regression on 1350 subjects matched for age, sex, and T2D status to detect deviations from normative aging.

Result: After confounder adjustment, 10 of 13 features show significant age-related trends differing between T2D and controls (p<0.05 after multiple corrections). MRI measurements diverge from CT when using the AI-based method.

Conclusion: Pancreas morphology is altered in type 2 diabetes; the study provides lifespan trends and a normative reference from a large non-diabetic cohort (675 controls vs 675 diabetes patients for the matched analysis; 1350 in the regression). It reinforces that the pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

### [72] [MS-CLR: Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning for Human Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14889)
*Mert Kiray,Alvaro Ritter,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-CLR introduces a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions to improve cross-convention generalization in skeleton-based action recognition; it adapts ST-GCN to a unified multi-convention representation and achieves state-of-the-art results when combining skeletons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-skeleton contrastive learning struggles to generalize across datasets with different joint structures and anatomical coverage; leveraging multiple skeleton conventions can learn invariances to joint layouts and capture diverse anatomical cues.

Method: Extract multiple skeleton conventions from the same sequence; train a contrastive objective that aligns representations across conventions; adapt ST-GCN to handle varying joint layouts via a unified representation; optionally form a multi-skeleton ensemble for improved performance.

Result: MS-CLR consistently beats strong single-skeleton baselines on NTU RGB+D 60 and 120; a multi-skeleton ensemble further improves accuracy and sets new state-of-the-art on both datasets.

Conclusion: Learning structural invariances across skeleton conventions yields more expressive and generalizable features for skeleton-based action recognition; the approach enables better cross-dataset transfer and robustness to anatomical variability.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

### [73] [GaussianArt: Unified Modeling of Geometry and Motion for Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14891)
*Licheng Shen,Saining Zhang,Honghan Li,Peilin Yang,Zihao Huang,Zongzheng Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified articulated representation uses 3D Gaussian fields to jointly model geometry and motion, enabling scalable reconstruction of complex, multi-part objects (up to 20 parts) and introducing MPArt-90 to benchmark scalability/generalization. It yields superior part-level geometry and motion estimation and has strong downstream applicability in robotics and human-scene interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches decouple geometry and motion, reconstructing shapes in discrete states and then estimating articulation. This brittle initialization hampers robustness and scalability, especially for objects with many parts. A unified representation should jointly infer geometry and articulation to improve robustness and scalability.

Method: Introduce articulated 3D Gaussians that jointly model geometry and motion. The method scales to objects with up to 20 parts and is evaluated on MPArt-90, a benchmark of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories to assess scalability and generalization.

Result: The approach achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation across diverse object types, outperforming baselines that struggle beyond 2–3 parts. It demonstrates robustness and scalability for multi-part articulation and renders results relevant for downstream tasks like robotic simulation and human-scene interaction modeling.

Conclusion: Unified articulated representations enable scalable, robust physical modeling of articulated objects. MPArt-90 provides a comprehensive benchmark for scalability and generalization, and the method shows promise for applications in robotics, simulation, and human–scene interaction.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

TL;DR: Transforming tabular student data into graphs via clustering can improve dropout prediction, with GraphSAGE on a PCA-KMeans graph delivering the best performance among tested configurations, though many GNN setups underperform compared to strong tabular models depending on graph construction choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dropout is costly and predicting at-risk students can enable timely interventions. GNNs may exploit relational structure in student data if represented as graphs, potentially surpassing traditional tabular models.

Method: Convert tabular data into graphs using clustering (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP). Train and compare GNNs (GCN, GraphSAGE) against tabular baselines (RF, XGBoost, TabNet) on a real-world dataset. Evaluate across graph construction strategies and report macro F1 and accuracy.

Result: The best-performing setup was GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieving a macro F1 improvement of ~7 percentage points and accuracy gain of ~2 percentage points over the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). Other GNN configurations and graph methods did not consistently beat tabular models, highlighting the importance of graph construction strategy and GNN architecture.

Conclusion: GNNs have potential for dropout prediction when graphs are constructed effectively, but success heavily depends on the graph generation method and architecture. Careful design of the graph representation is crucial to surpass strong tabular baselines.

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

### [75] [Load Forecasting on A Highly Sparse Electrical Load Dataset Using Gaussian Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14069)
*Chinmoy Biswas,Nafis Faisal,Vivek Chowdhury,Abrar Al-Shadid Abir,Sabir Mahmud,Mithon Rahman,Shaikh Anowarul Fattah,Hafiz Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian interpolation enables using a highly sparse (≈62%) hourly load dataset for forecasting by treating the data as WSS, with LSTM delivering the strongest performance among evaluated models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparsity in real-world datasets hampers forecasting; standard interpolation works mainly for Strict Sense Stationary data, so the study tests augmentation to handle Wide Sense Stationary data.

Method: Analyze the dataset; apply interpolation methods (linear, polynomial, spline, moving average, Gaussian); train multiple ML/DL models; compare performance; assess suitability of Gaussian interpolation; identify best model.

Result: Gaussian interpolation allows a 62% sparse dataset to be used for load forecasting under the WSS assumption; LSTM outperforms other classical and neural network models in this setup; Gaussian interpolation deemed a suitable option for dealing with load forecasting problems.

Conclusion: Gaussian interpolation is a viable method for addressing sparsity in load forecasting, with LSTM as the top-performing model among the tested approaches.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

*Bachtiar Herdianto,Romain Billot,Flavien Lucas,Marc Sevaux,Daniele Vigo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid ML and metaheuristic framework for VRPs uses an edge selector to prune prohibited moves, via a tabular classifier (GB Trees/FFN) and a Graph Neural Network, improving CVRP and CVRPTW performance on large instances up to 30k customers, with statistical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle Routing Problems are hard; improving local search efficiency and solution quality via learned guidance can boost metaheuristics; need scalable and generalizable methods across sizes and variants.

Method: Develop an edge selector that labels solution edges as prohibited during local search. Two learning approaches: (1) tabular binary classifier using gradient boosting trees and FFN, with threshold adjustments for class imbalance; (2) Graph Neural Network leveraging graph structure for direct edge prediction. Integrate both into state-of-the-art metaheuristics for CVRP and CVRPTW; evaluate on large benchmark datasets with pairwise stats.

Result: Demonstrates scalability and generalizability; improvements observed across different baselines, problem sizes, and variants; validated on benchmarks up to 30,000 nodes with pairwise statistical analysis confirming improvements.

Conclusion: ML-guided edge selection can effectively guide local search in VRP metaheuristics, yielding consistent performance gains and generalizing to large CVRP variants; supports broader adoption of ML-augmented metaheuristics in routing problems.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

*Qian Zhanga,Ruilin Zhang,Jun Xiao,Yifan Liu,Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework MCLPD for cross-dataset Parkinson's detection using multi-view contrastive pre-training on unlabeled EEG data and lightweight supervised fine-tuning on small labeled subsets from other datasets, achieving strong F1 scores with minimal labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle limited labeled EEG data and significant cross-dataset variability (protocols, demographics) that hurt generalization. Leverage unlabeled data and self-supervised contrastive learning to fuse time-frequency information and boost cross-dataset performance.

Method: MCLPD pre-trains via self-supervised, multi-view contrastive learning on unlabeled UNM EEG data. Builds contrastive pairs using dual augmentations in time and frequency domains to fuse time-frequency information. Fine-tunes with a small fraction of labeled data from UI and UC datasets using lightweight supervised optimization.

Result: On UI and UC, achieving F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.81 with only 1% labeled data; improved to 0.97 and 0.87 with 5% labeled data. Outperforms existing methods in cross-dataset generalization while reducing labeling requirements.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances cross-dataset PD detection under data-scarce labeling by combining multi-view self-supervised pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness to protocol and demographic differences.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

*Qian Zhang,Ruilin Zhang,Biaokai Zhu,Xun Han,Jun Xiao,Yifan Liu,Zhe Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAN-enhanced generalizable model (GEPD) for cross-dataset EEG-based Parkinson's disease classification, combining a GAN-based fusion EEG data generator with an EEG quality assessment module and a multi-CNN classifier to capture time-frequency features, achieving cross-dataset accuracy of 84.3% and F1 of 84.0%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-dataset variability and small dataset sizes hinder generalization in EEG-based PD detection. A model that generalizes across datasets is needed for robust cross-dataset PD classification.

Method: Propose GEPD: (1) a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling distribution similarity between generated and real data; (2) an EEG signal quality assessment model to ensure the quality of generated data; (3) a classification network using a combination of multiple CNNs to capture time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals while maintaining generalizable structure and easy convergence. The approach emphasizes cross-dataset generalization for PD detection.

Result: The model achieves cross-dataset performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, with an accuracy of 84.3% and an F1-score of 84.0% in cross-dataset settings, illustrating good generalizability.

Conclusion: GAN-based data generation with quality control and a robust multi-CNN classifier can yield generalizable EEG-based PD detection across datasets; further work could explore more datasets and ablation studies to isolate contributions of the generator, quality model, and classifier.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

TL;DR: Extends explainability of Graph Spectral Clustering for textual data from cosine on term vectors to other embeddings, especially GloVe-like embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve semantic representation beyond bag-of-words and enhance the interpretability of clustering results by using richer document representations.

Method: Generalizes the explainability framework to embeddings beyond term-vector cosine, focusing on GloVe-style embeddings to compute document similarities and reconstruct the similarity graph used in spectral clustering.

Result: The abstract does not report empirical results; it only states the generalization to GloVe-based embeddings.

Conclusion: The explainability framework for graph spectral clustering on text can be extended to alternative document embeddings, notably GloVe-based representations.

Abstract: In a previous paper, we proposed an introduction to the explainability of
Graph Spectral Clustering results for textual documents, given that document
similarity is computed as cosine similarity in term vector space.

*Mengdi Li,Guanqiao Chen,Xufeng Zhao,Haochen Wen,Shu Yang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PersRM-R1 presents a reasoning-based reward model that identifies and encodes personal factors from one or few exemplars, leveraging synthetic data and a two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning) to achieve strong personalization with data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences under limited data and across diverse domains, hindering effective personalization of LLMs.

Method: Use synthetic data generation combined with a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn personal factors from exemplars and synthetic data; 2) reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to align outputs with personal preferences, guided by a reasoning-based reward model designed to extract personal factors from few exemplars.

Result: PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in accuracy and generalizability for personalized preferences, suggesting data-efficient personalization without resorting to very large models.

Conclusion: This framework enables more effective personalized LLMs by achieving strong performance with limited data, combining synthetic generation with a two-stage training regime to infer and generalize personal factors.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Label smoothing can be interpreted as solving an information bottleneck, capturing the IB-optimal solution and acting as a practical, robust IB method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why label smoothing improves generalization by connecting it to the information bottleneck and to present a simple, practical IB approach.

Method: Theoretical analysis under assumptions of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels for the same input, complemented by experiments showing that label smoothing leads to the IB-optimal solution and is invariant to non-informative factors conditioned on relevant information.

Result: Theoretical and empirical evidence that label smoothing guides the model toward information bottleneck optima; it behaves as a practical method for IB and is insensitive to factors lacking information about the target or not adding information given conditioning.

Conclusion: Label smoothing can be viewed as a straightforward, practical implementation of the information bottleneck, providing robustness to nuisance factors and preserving target-relevant information.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A PI-driven feature selection framework with Inductive Conformal Prediction enhances multivariate time-series forecasts of oil production; LSTM-based models yield best out-of-sample performance with valid prediction intervals demonstrated on Volve and Norne datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robustness and quantification of uncertainty in out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasts for multivariate time-series by combining reservoir-engineering insights (PI-driven feature selection) with distribution-free uncertainty measures (ICP).

Method: PI-based feature selection reduces input dimensionality; evaluates LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and XGBoost on historical Volve wells PF14, PF12 and Norne well E1H; forecasts OPR_H; uses MAE, Forecast Bias, and Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) for evaluation; applies Inductive Conformal Prediction to generate valid prediction intervals (e.g., 95% coverage) without distributional assumptions.

Result: LSTM achieved the best performance with the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and on genuine out-of-sample forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with validation on Norne well E1H; PI-based feature selection reduced input dimensionality compared with conventional numerical workflows; ICP provided distribution-free, valid prediction intervals.

Conclusion: Combining domain-specific PI-guided feature selection with advanced ML models and ICP uncertainty quantification improves the reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts and offers robust, interpretable prediction intervals suitable for complex, non-normal data.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale empirical study benchmarks robust fine-tuning for image models, revealing that supervised CNNs pretrained on large datasets often beat modern attention-based and other pretrained representations in robustness, with broad implications for design choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how architecture, pretraining, loss, and adaptation protocol influence robustness/generalization under input perturbations.

Method: Benchmark across 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 losses, and 3 adaptation protocols; 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types.

Result: CNNs pretrained with supervised learning on large datasets often outperform other pretrained representations for robustness; results both confirm and challenge prior design assumptions; robustness generalization depends on multiple interacting design choices; provides practical guidance and highlights promising research directions.

Conclusion: Offers practical guidance for practitioners and identifies promising directions to advance robust fine-tuning, emphasizing that architecture choice and pretrained representation strongly influence robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces KnowDR-REC, a knowledge-driven referring-expression comprehension benchmark with fine-grained negative samples and three new evaluation metrics. Evaluations across 16 multimodal models show current MLLMs struggle with knowledge-grounded visual grounding and rely on shortcut correlations, revealing a gap between textual understanding and grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing REC benchmarks inadequately test knowledge-driven reasoning and robustness (they rely on intra-image cues or lack fine-grained annotations). There is a need to evaluate and improve multimodal models’ ability to ground language in real-world knowledge and resist hallucinations.

Method: Construct KnowDR-REC based on real-world knowledge requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning. Create elaborately constructed negative samples via fine-grained expression editing to test robustness. Propose three novel evaluation metrics to probe internal reasoning. Evaluate 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on the benchmark.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. There is a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding, with many models swayed by memorized shortcut correlations, harming genuine multimodal reasoning on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The benchmark is expected to spur development of more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks, leading to more reliable multimodal systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) for Equilibrium Propagation (EP) RNNs mitigates catastrophic forgetting in continual learning; with SRC and awake replay, MRNN-EP rivals or surpasses BPTT-based models across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in EP-trained RNNs and mimic human memory consolidation processes observed during sleep.

Method: Introduce SRC algorithm for EP-trained multilayer RNNs (MRNN-EP). Apply SRC after each new task in class-incremental learning; compare against regularization baselines; evaluate on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet; also explore awake replay in combination with SRC.

Result: SRC significantly improves resilience to forgetting in continual learning. MRNN-EP with SRC matches or exceeds BPTT with SRC on MNIST and surpasses BPTT-based models on Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Awake replay further boosts long-term knowledge retention when learning new tasks.

Conclusion: Sleep-like replay is effective for EP-trained RNNs, enabling stronger continual learning. Combining SRC with rehearsal (awake replay) enhances memory retention, supporting the integration of human-like learning behaviors into artificial networks.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

*Ye Su,Hezhe Qiao,Wei Huang,Lin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRILL is a semi-supervised regression framework that converts direct regression into discrete distribution estimation using buckets, and distills knowledge via decoupled distribution alignment between teacher and student, yielding strong generalization and superior performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised regression (SSR) suffers from reliance on noisy pseudo-labels and overfitting when regressing directly. There is a need to better capture label distributions and robustly transfer knowledge from teachers to students.

Method: Transform the regression task into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) problem over multiple buckets. Use Decoupled Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the bucket distributions of target and non-target across teacher and student during distillation, training end-to-end.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show DRILL achieves strong generalization and outperforms competing semi-supervised regression methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DRILL framework effectively mitigates pseudo-label quality issues and overfitting in SSR and provides a generalizable end-to-end approach for distribution-aware semi-supervised regression.

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning framework on an attributed POI graph improves crowd flow inference from noisy, unlabeled data, with fine-tuning on scarce accurate labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity of labels, complex spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs, and misalignment between precise crowd flow and GPS reports necessitate leveraging unlabeled data.

Method: Build a spatial POI graph; pre-train with a swapped-prediction contrastive objective on unlabeled spatio-temporal data; fine-tune on limited labeled crowd flow data.

Result: Pre-trained model using extensive noisy data outperforms models trained from scratch on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Self-supervised graph-based pretraining is effective for crowd flow inference under limited labeled data and can generalize to related urban sensing tasks.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

*Hanseul Kang,Shervin Karimkashi,Ville Vuorinen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework extending SINDy to discover interpretable PDEs and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter data, with symbolic parameterization, a dimensional similarity filter, batch-friendly Gram aggregation, and ensemble-consensus for robust model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automatic discovery of governing PDEs and physically meaningful SGS closures across varying physical parameters, addressing SINDy limitations like parameter variation handling, unit consistency, memory efficiency, and robustness.

Method: Introduce symbolic parameterisation for varying physical parameters within a unified regression; apply a Dimensional Similarity Filter to enforce unit-consistency and prune candidate libraries; implement memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation for batch processing; use ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis to select robust models. Validate on 1D benchmarks and apply to filtered Burgers data to derive an SGS closure tau_SGS = 0.1603·Δ^2(∂ū/∂x)^2, yielding a Smagorinsky constant ~0.4004.

Result: Successfully recovered governing equations across parameter ranges; autonomously discovered an SGS closure matching a Smagorinsky-type structure; achieved R^2 = 0.886 across filter scales and outperformed classical closures in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates autonomous, data-driven discovery of Smagorinsky-type closures without prior theoretical assumptions, providing physically meaningful forms and calibrated coefficients, and offering a complementary tool for turbulence modelling.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEGDM introduces a lightweight diffusion-based framework for EEG representation learning that outperforms state-of-the-art EEG models (including EEG foundation models) on the Temple University EEG Event Corpus while being ~19x more lightweight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals are highly variable and sparsely annotated, and large EEG foundation models are computationally expensive with only marginal performance gains. There is a need for efficient, robust representations for downstream EEG tasks.

Method: Develop a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to capture EEG temporal dynamics, trained via a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Learn latent EEG representations and use a latent fusion transformer (LFT) for downstream classification.

Result: On the multi-event Temple University EEG Event Corpus, EEGDM outperformed current state-of-the-art methods, including EEG foundation models, while being approximately 19x more lightweight in computation.

Conclusion: EEGDM provides a promising, computationally efficient alternative to large EEG foundation models for EEG representation learning, with strong empirical performance on standard benchmarks. The authors also provide code at the linked repository.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A particle-physics foundation model trained self-supervised on 11M events with up to 188M parameters, using frozen backbones and task-specific adapters to outperform baselines and enable data-efficient adaptation; representations are task-agnostic but can be specialized with a linear probe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying foundation models to experimental particle physics is challenging due to the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data. The work investigates whether anFM can scale and generalize across diverse downstream tasks in this domain.

Method: Construct a large detector-data dataset (>11 million events) and introduce a self-supervised training method for detector data. Train models up to 188M parameters, use frozen weights with adapters for downstream tasks, and evaluate across multiple tasks. Analyze representations and show that task-agnostic features can be specialized via a single linear mapping.

Result: The foundation model consistently outperforms baseline models across all downstream tasks. It shows robust data-efficient adaptation, and its representations are largely task-agnostic yet can be specialized for different tasks using a simple linear mapping.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates scalable, generalizable scientific foundation models for particle physics, with efficient adaptation via adapters and linear probes, indicating a promising direction for FM in experimental physics.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

### [93] [CoBAD: Modeling Collective Behaviors for Human Mobility Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14088)
*Haomin Wen,Shurui Cao,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoBAD: a two-stage attention-based model for unsupervised collective anomaly detection in mobility, using collective event sequences and a co-occurrence graph; demonstrates strong improvements over baselines and detects both co-occurrence and absence anomalies; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting collective anomalies in mobility requires modeling inter-individual spatiotemporal dependencies, which is underexplored compared to individual-level anomaly detection. There is a need for scalable, unsupervised methods that can capture interactions among multiple individuals and handle absence-type anomalies.

Method: Formulate the problem over Collective Event Sequences (CES) with a co-occurrence event graph. CoBAD uses a two-stage attention mechanism to model (1) individual mobility patterns and (2) interactions across multiple individuals. It is pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior data via masked event and link reconstruction tasks, enabling detection of two anomaly types: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies.

Result: Experiments on large-scale mobility datasets show CoBAD outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, with improvements of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR.

Conclusion: CoBAD effectively detects collective anomalies in human mobility, including the largely overlooked absence anomalies. The approach offers a scalable, unsupervised solution with strong empirical performance; source code is available.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

*Matthew Morris,David J. Tena Cucala,Bernardo Cuenca Grau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends explainable link prediction by enforcing monotonicity in GNNs and scoring functions, enabling sound Datalog rules and equivalent Datalog programs for some models, with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs for knowledge graphs have limited explainability; prior rule extraction only covered low-expressivity encodings. This work aims to broaden explainability to general link prediction with scoring functions by leveraging monotonicity.

Method: Impose monotonicity on GNNs and their scoring functions, then derive sound explanation rules from the monotone structure; use existing results on the expressivity of scoring functions to bound the type of rules captured; provide procedures to obtain equivalent Datalog programs for certain monotonic GNN+scoring-function classes.

Result: Monotonic GNNs with scoring functions yield many sound Datalog rules and perform well on link prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: Monotonicity enables sound explanations and aligns the expressive power of GNNs with computable Datalog programs, offering practical explainability without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

TL;DR: This work analyzes how action-space dimensionality affects TRPO and PPO under KL-divergence and clipping constraints, combining theory with morphology-driven experiments in Gymnasium Swimmer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability and behavior of trust-region policy optimization when policies must adapt to different kinematic structures, enabling scalable, reusable controllers.

Method: Theoretical analysis of TRPO and PPO under varying action-space dimensionality and constraint penalties; empirical evaluation with controlled morphologies using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment.

Result: Provides insights into how dimensionality reshapes the optimization landscape under KL or clipping penalties; demonstrates empirical trends in performance across morphological variations.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of trust-region methods in morphologically diverse settings and informs design of morphology-general policies.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

*Benjamin Pikus,Pratyush Ranjan Tiwari,Burton Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hard examples yield the biggest gains in GRPO fine-tuning under a fixed data budget; easy examples give the least gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection for language model fine-tuning is expensive. With a fixed acquisition budget, it is important to know which difficulty of examples to prioritize to maximize performance, especially for reasoning tasks.

Method: The study compares GRPO fine-tuning using four subset selection policies drawn from the same unlabeled pool. Difficulty estimates are obtained via multi-sample evaluation on a base model, across different model sizes and families.

Result: Training on the hardest examples provides the largest performance gains (up to 47%), while easy examples provide the smallest gains. Hard examples offer more learnable opportunities during GRPO training, driving the gains.

Conclusion: For budget-constrained post-training, prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

TL;DR: Physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) enable expressive, programmable reward structures in RL, improving sample efficiency via counterfactuals and shaping across physical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To separate environment knowledge captured by the reward mechanism from what remains unknown and must be learned, reducing sample complexity and speeding up learning.

Method: Introduce pRMs as symbolic reward machines encoding learning objectives; develop RL algorithms that exploit pRMs through counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping in both finite and continuous physical environments.

Result: Empirical results show accelerated reward acquisition and improved learning efficiency on multiple control tasks across finite and continuous physical domains.

Conclusion: pRMs offer a more expressive, programmable, and efficient framework for RL by tightly integrating physics-informed reward structures into learning.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IHNN proposes an implicit hypergraph neural network that learns fixed-point representations for nodes and hyperedges via implicit differentiation and projected gradient descent, addressing degradation when stacking message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependencies, and achieves state-of-the-art node classification on real hypergraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypergraph neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies; increasing message-passing rounds degrades performance; implicit GNNs show potential on standard graphs but hypergraph counterparts are unexplored.

Method: Jointly learns fixed-point representations for nodes and hyperedges using an end-to-end framework with implicit differentiation; uses a tractable projected gradient descent to train.

Result: Outperforms prior hypergraph NN methods in most settings on real-world hypergraphs for node classification, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: IHNN effectively captures long-range, high-order dependencies in hypergraphs and offers a scalable, end-to-end trainable approach leveraging implicit fixed-point learning.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities
underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban campuses face parking scarcity; a need exists to allocate vacant spots efficiently without installing new sensors by leveraging existing location-based data.

Method: Integrates street maps, mobility, and meteorological data via a spatial join to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement over 3 consecutive days at hourly intervals from 7 AM to 3 PM. No street or parking sensors are required; data are collected through location services. The system predicts expected parking entrance and time to designate a suitable parking area. Models tested: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Hyperparameters tuned with grid search. Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, and R^2.

Result: Random Forest Regression achieved the best performance with RMSE = 0.142 and R^2 = 0.582 on the given dataset. Despite the short horizon and limited data, the LSTM model is acknowledged as potentially superior with more data and longer time steps due to the time-series nature of parking patterns.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility of sensor-free parking management on campuses by fusing diverse data sources. RFR currently offers the best accuracy for the evaluated setup, but the LSTM model may outperform with more extensive data and longer sequences. Future work should explore longer training horizons, more data, and deployment considerations such as data quality, privacy, and real-world integration.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

*S. Josyula,Y. Noiman,E. J. Payton,T. Giovannelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-assisted SMA composition design using two models (tree ensemble and NN) and two optimizers; neural network with gradient-based TRUST-CONSTR yields more reliable, near-optimal Ms and cost targets than derivative-free COBYLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of designing affordable, sustainable SMAs with a targeted martensitic start temperature (Ms) when data is scarce; leverage physics-informed features and experimental data to guide optimization.

Method: Train two surrogate models (tree-based ensemble and neural network) on experimentally characterized SMA data with physics-informed features. Use COBYLA (derivative-free) to optimize using the tree model; use TRUST-CONSTR (gradient-based) to optimize using the neural network. Compare accuracy and solution quality.

Result: Both models achieve similar Ms prediction accuracy. The NN+TRUST-CONSTR optimizer finds better, more consistent alloy compositions and more robustly reaches targets. COBYLA often yields suboptimal results, especially from distant starting points.

Conclusion: A practical, data-efficient framework for exploring SMA compositions by fusing physics-informed ML and optimization; experimental data improves reliability; adaptable to other materials with limited data.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

### [102] [ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134)
*Xin Wu,Fei Teng,Ji Zhang,Xingwang Li,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERIS is an end-to-end energy-regularized framework for guided feature disentanglement in time series classification to improve OOD robustness, using energy-guided calibration, weight-level orthogonality, and structured perturbation adversarial training, yielding ~4.04% average accuracy gain on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ideal time series classification should learn invariant representations, but performance on out-of-distribution data is hampered by entanglement of domain-specific and label-relevant features, leading to spurious correlations. Current disentanglement methods are unguided and lack semantic direction.

Method: An end-to-end ERIS framework with (1) energy-guided calibration for semantic guidance; (2) weight-level orthogonality enforcing independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features; (3) auxiliary adversarial training injecting structured perturbations to enhance robustness.

Result: ERIS achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.04% over state-of-the-art baselines across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: ERIS provides semantically-guided, robust feature disentanglement for time series classification, improving OOD reliability and surpassing baselines on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

### [103] [STAS: Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Computation Time for Spiking Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14138)
*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Brent ByungHoon Kang,Hyeongboo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAS co-designs architecture and dynamic computation for SNN ViTs, introducing I-SPS for temporal stability and A-SSA for spatio-temporal token pruning, achieving notable energy savings while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs offer energy efficiency but suffer high latency and overhead due to multi-timestep operation. ACT-inspired adaptive computation is promising but faces two core issues for SNN ViTs: temporal dissimilarity and a static architecture unsuited for adaptive time sharing.

Method: STAS co-designs the static architecture and the dynamic computation policy. It introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to unify input representation and stabilize temporal dynamics. This enables adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) to perform two-dimensional token pruning across spatial and temporal axes on spiking Transformer architectures.

Result: On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8% and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously achieving accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: A unified co-design of architecture and adaptive computation, with I-SPS stabilizing temporal inputs and A-SSA enabling 2D token pruning, yields substantial energy savings and accuracy gains in SNN-based vision transformers.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

*Collins O. Ogbodo,Timothy J. Rogers,Mattia Dal Borgo,David J. Wagg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive AI-based framework for modal test sensor placement using reinforcement learning in an underspecified POMDP; dual-curriculum training; validated on a steel cantilever to optimize sensor locations across frequency segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address static, rigid modal test design that ignores evolving campaign parameters and earlier decisions like sensor configurations, leading to reduced accuracy; need robust, adaptive decision support.

Method: Agent-based decision support; model as underspecified partially observable Markov decision process; train generalist RL agent via dual-curriculum learning; apply to dynamic modal test environments; case study on steel cantilever; optimize sensor locations across frequency segments.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in optimizing sensor locations across frequency segments; shows robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Conclusion: An adaptable, robust sensor-placement framework for modal tests under changing environments, enhancing test accuracy and flexibility; practical viability demonstrated.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

TL;DR: A neuroscience-inspired sparse modular ANN architecture (G2GNet) with dynamic sparse training and Hebbian-like rewiring achieves strong performance with high sparsity on vision benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To translate cortical organization principles into ANN design to improve efficiency, scalability, and robustness as networks scale, by leveraging sparse, modular, and functionally wired connectivity patterns observed in the brain.

Method: Introduce G2GNet with sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers; apply dynamic sparse training (DST) that prunes and regrows connections; implement a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations; evaluate on vision datasets Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100.

Result: G2GNet reaches up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% over dense baselines, using significantly fewer parameters and computations, on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: Incorporating biologically observed functional connectivity as a structural bias, together with dynamic pruning/rewiring, can yield efficient, accurate sparse neural networks, offering a promising direction for neuroscience-informed ANN design.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

### [106] [Learning to Learn the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram using Physics-Informed and meta Machine Learning techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14137)
*Amalie Roark,Serio Agriesti,Francisco Camara Pereira,Guido Cantelmo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning is used to estimate the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) with limited loop-detector data by transferring knowledge across cities. A Meta-Learning Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network improves MFD flow prediction when detector coverage varies, outperforming traditional transfer learning and FitFun.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The MFD is a useful aggregated description of traffic dynamics, but its estimation requires dense loop-detector data. In practice, detector data is scarce, motivating a framework that can generalize MFD estimation across cities with varying detector coverage and topology.

Method: Train an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network within a meta-learning framework using data from multiple cities to model the MFD. The model adapts to new cities with different detector shares and topologies, enabling MFD estimation with limited data.

Result: The approach achieved substantial average MSE reductions in flow prediction across detector subsets, with improvements roughly in the range of 17,500 to 36,000 (unit not specified). It demonstrated better generalization to cities with scarce data and outperformed traditional transfer learning; it was also validated against FitFun, a non-parametric baseline.

Conclusion: Meta-learning with a Multi-Task Physics-Informed Network is a promising strategy for robust MFD estimation under data scarcity, enabling transferability across diverse urban settings and enhancing performance over conventional transfer learning and non-parametric baselines.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

*Xin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) reframes intelligence as non-ergodic, memory-cycle-driven inference rather than gradient-based recomputation, using structured memory and topological constraints to enable efficient, context-aware cognition and linking to AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies of gradient-based search in large AI models by leveraging structured reuse of past inference trajectories, memory-guided inference, and topological constraints to model cognition and improve energy efficiency.

Method: Introduce MAI as a formal framework where cognition is inference over latent cycles in memory; encode inductive biases via structural memory reuse; use delta-homology and topological memory; connect to Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm by modeling cortical columns as local inference operators; establish a time-reversal duality with reinforcement learning.

Result: MAI provides a principled foundation for memory-guided, structure-preserving inference, lowers energy consumption, and offers a unified theory of intelligence grounded in structure and memory; suggests a path toward AGI by reframing cognitive computation in non-ergodic terms.

Conclusion: MAI offers a biologically grounded, memory-centric account of intelligence, unifying structure, reuse, and memory, with implications for energy-efficient AI and artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

TL;DR: A probabilistic extension of the TGN-SVDD model for robust network intrusion detection under noisy inputs, predicting per-event Gaussian parameters to handle noise; shows improved detection over the baseline on a noise-augmented CIC-IDS2017 dataset, with larger gains at higher noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness of graph-based intrusion detection methods when faced with contaminated/ noisy data inputs and adversarial perturbations.

Method: Develop a probabilistic version of Temporal Graph Network SVDD (TGN-SVDD) that predicts Gaussian distribution parameters for each network event, enabling probabilistic handling of input noise and adversarial perturbations.

Result: On a modified CIC-IDS2017 dataset with synthetic noise, the probabilistic TGN-SVDD significantly outperforms the baseline TGN-SVDD, with larger performance improvements as noise levels increase.

Conclusion: Incorporating probabilistic modeling into TGN-SVDD enhances robustness to noisy and adversarial inputs in network intrusion detection, improving detection performance under noisy conditions.

Abstract: In the domain of network intrusion detection, robustness against contaminated
and noisy data inputs remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a
probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data
Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the
presence of input noise. By predicting parameters of a Gaussian distribution
for each network event, our model is able to naturally address noisy
adversarials and improve robustness compared to a baseline model. Our
experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate
significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline
TGN-SVDD model, especially as noise levels increase.

*Liyi Zhang,Jake Snell,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABMLL is an amortized Bayesian meta-learning approach for LoRA fine-tuning of large language models that improves generalization and uncertainty estimation, scalable to models like Llama3-8B and outperforming baselines on Unified-QA and CrossFit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA fine-tuning can overfit and not generalize well to unseen datasets; existing generalization techniques (in-context prompts, meta-learning) incur high memory/computation costs.

Method: Introduce an amortized Bayesian meta-learning framework for LoRA, reframe task-specific and global LoRA parameters, and include new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy with fidelity to global parameters; enables improved uncertainty quantification.

Result: Demonstrates improved generalization and better calibration (lower expected calibration error) on Unified-QA and CrossFit, and scales to Llama3-8B.

Conclusion: ABMLL provides effective, scalable generalization for LoRA-tuned LLMs with enhanced uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

TL;DR: Evaluates multiple deep learning-based vessel trajectory prediction models across traffic complexities using probability of detection to assess reliability per traffic category, revealing strengths/weaknesses and safe forecast horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consideration of traffic-situation complexity and reliability in VTP, enabling safer and more efficient inland navigation by quantifying model reliability across scenarios.

Method: Categorize test samples by traffic situation during the prediction horizon; compare several DL-based VTP models; apply probability of detection analysis to estimate reliability; report per-category performance and horizon-dependent reliability.

Result: Provides a nuanced understanding of model performance across traffic complexities and horizon lengths, highlighting where models are reliable and where they fail; introduces horizon-specific reliability estimates that inform safe forecasting.

Conclusion: Findings guide the development of more reliable VTP approaches and support safer, more efficient inland waterways navigation by enabling reliability-informed predictions.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphCBMs extend Concept Bottleneck Models by learning latent graphs among concepts, enabling the model to capture inter-concept relationships for better accuracy, richer interpretability, and more effective interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concepts in existing CBMs are assumed conditionally independent, ignoring inherent correlations. Real-world concepts influence each other, so modeling their relations can improve both predictive performance and interpretability.

Method: Introduce latent concept graphs within CBMs and integrate graph learning with the concept bottleneck framework. Use the graph structure to propagate information among concepts and guide interventions, then evaluate on real-world image classification tasks across various architectures and training settings.

Result: GraphCBMs achieve superior image classification performance while providing richer concept-structure information for interpretability. Interventions utilizing latent graphs are more effective, and performance is robust across different training conditions and architectures.

Conclusion: Modeling latent relationships among concepts via graphs enhances CBMs in both accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable and robust path to more informative, debuggable neural networks.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A/I-GLASS: training-free, dynamic FFN unit pruning for LLMs on edge devices using activation- and impact-based global-local neuron statistics, outperforming prior methods—especially for long-form generation—without extra inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of LLMs requires reducing compute without sacrificing quality. Static or predictor-based pruning locks a single sparsity pattern or adds runtime overhead, and zero-shot prompts relying on single-prompt statistics fail in short prompts or long generations. A robust, prompt-aware, training-free pruning method is needed that avoids extra inference cost.

Method: Two training-free pruning methods: Activation-based and Impact-based Global-Local aggregation for FFN sparsification (A/I-GLASS). The approach uses a rank-aggregation of prompt-local neuron statistics (activation-driven signals from prompts) and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics (intrinsic importance across the model) to dynamically select FFN units for pruning. It does not rely on auxiliary predictors and imposes no additional inference overhead.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple LLMs and benchmarks shows GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, with notable gains in long-form generation scenarios.

Conclusion: A/I-GLASS provides a robust, training-free mechanism to dynamically prune FFN units in LLMs deployed on edge hardware, achieving better quality under varying prompt lengths without incurring runtime overhead, enabling more efficient edge inference.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive learning of time-varying convex combinations of multiple fairness measures under limited feedback, to balance group and individual fairness notions as their relative importance changes over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to consider multiple fairness notions whose relative importance is unknown, dynamic, and must be learned online, using limited feedback.

Method: Introduce a framework for learning time-varying convexifications (convex combinations) of several fairness regularizers, operating under graph-structured feedback that restricts available information.

Result: The abstract presents a framework and problem formulation but does not report empirical or theoretical guarantees; it emphasizes the setup for adaptive, online learning of fairness weights with constrained feedback.

Conclusion: The work proposes a pathway to dynamically balance multiple fairness notions by learning adaptive, convexified regularizers under limited feedback, enabling on-the-fly fairness trade-offs.

Abstract: There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple
measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness
notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori
unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider
the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures

### [114] [Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313)
*Can Jin,Yang Zhou,Qixin Zhang,Hongwu Peng,Di Zhang,Marco Pavone,Ligong Han,Zhang-Wei Hong,Tong Che,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIRL-S unifies RL-based and search-based test-time scaling by learning a dense, dynamic reward model (PRM) via adversarial inverse reinforcement learning from correct reasoning traces. This PRM acts as both RL critic and search heuristic, improving robustness, generalization, and performance across tasks, with gains of ~9% over base models and matching GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling for LLMs has split into two main paradigms—sparse RL rewards and static, labeled PRMs—each with instability, data-label costs, and poor generalization under distribution shifts. A unified, data-efficient PRM could enhance robustness and reduce labeling costs.

Method: Train a dense PRM using AIRL with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) from correct reasoning traces, eliminating the need for labeled intermediate data. At inference, use the learned PRM as the RL critic and as a heuristic to guide search, enabling robust chain-of-thought reasoning and mitigating reward hacking.

Result: Across eight benchmarks (math, scientific reasoning, code generation), the approach yields ~9% average improvement over the base model, matching GPT-4o. When integrated into multiple search algorithms, the PRM outperforms all baselines trained with labeled data.

Conclusion: The RL-derived reward function doubles as a strong, robust PRM for search, offering a cost-effective, unified solution for complex reasoning in LLMs and improved cross-task generalization.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

*Konur Tholl,Mariam El Mezouar,Ranwa Al Mallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Four teacher-guided RL methods in CybORG accelerate learning for autonomous cyber operations, improving early performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ACO agents trained from scratch converge slowly and exhibit poor early performance; leveraging teacher guidance could speed up learning and produce safer, more reliable policies.

Method: Implemented four distinct teacher-guided techniques within the CybORG simulation environment and conducted a comparative evaluation on their effect on training efficiency, early policy performance, and convergence speed.

Result: Teacher integration significantly improved training efficiency, enhancing early policy performance and speeding up convergence across tasks.

Conclusion: Teacher-guided RL has strong potential to enhance autonomous cybersecurity applications by reducing training time and improving early-stage competence; warranted further exploration and application to real-world ACO scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

*Pritthijit Nath,Sebastian Schemm,Henry Moss,Peter Haynes,Emily Shuckburgh,Mark Webb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedRAIN-Lite applies federated reinforcement learning to sub-grid climate parameterisations by assigning agents to latitude bands; DDPG yields better performance than static/single-agent baselines in ebm-v2/v3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes static offline-tuned sub-grid parameterisations; enables adaptive, geographically aware learning; scalable for integration into higher-complexity GCMs; online-learning for climate adaptation.

Method: A FedRL framework (FedRAIN-Lite) with latitude-band agents; hierarchy of energy-balance climate models ebm-v1 to ebm-v3; evaluate three RL algorithms under FedRL configurations; focus on DDPG; periodic global aggregation; assess transfer of hyperparameters and computational efficiency.

Result: DDPG outperforms baselines, faster convergence, lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones, in ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups; demonstrates transferability and low cost.

Conclusion: This framework provides scalable path toward complex GCMs and a prototype for physically aligned online-learning climate models that can adapt to climate change; code available.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

*Lingkai Kong,Haichuan Wang,Charles A. Emogor,Vincent Börsch-Supan,Lily Xu,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow-matching with occupancy detection and a composite flow initialized from a linear model improves poaching prediction under imperfect detection and data scarcity; validated on two Ugandan parks with consistent accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poaching threatens wildlife and biodiversity; forecasting poacher behavior can inform patrol planning and conservation interventions. Existing linear or decision-tree models struggle with nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns, and real-world data face imperfect detection and scarcity.

Method: Integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model to infer underlying occupancy; train the flow in latent space; use a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise to inject prior knowledge and improve generalization.

Result: Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach addresses imperfect detection and data scarcity, enhancing poaching risk forecasting to support conservation actions.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

*Nícolas Roque dos Santos,Dawon Ahn,Diego Minatel,Alneu de Andrade Lopes,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GCTD, a multi-view graph condensation method using tensor decomposition to synthesize a compact, interpretable graph that preserves GNN performance, addressing bi-level optimization and missing node mappings; shows improvements on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale graphs demand substantial resources for storage and processing; existing condensation methods rely on expensive bi-level optimization and lack mappings from synthetic to original nodes, hindering interpretability; decomposition-based, transparent alternatives are not yet explored for graph condensation.

Method: Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD): applies tensor decomposition to learn a compact, multi-view representation and a mapping between synthetic and original nodes to enable informative graph condensation with reduced computation.

Result: Experiments on six real-world datasets show that GCTD reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to 4.0 improvement in accuracy on three datasets and competitive results on large graphs; code is released.

Conclusion: GCTD demonstrates that tensor-decomposition, multi-view condensation is a viable, transparent, and resource-efficient approach for graph condensation, opening avenues for decomposition-based methods in GNN compression.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

*Xu Weng,K. V. Ling,Haochen Liu,Bingheng Wang,Kun Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end neural ranging correction (NeRC) for GNSS localization that trains on ground-truth locations using differentiable MHE and Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps to reduce labeling burden, achieving improved urban localization and real-time edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ranging errors from multipath and poor hardware degrade urban GNSS accuracy, and obtaining precise ranging error labels is difficult; there is a need for data-efficient, learnable corrections.

Method: Propose NeRC framework: end-to-end neural modules for ranging correction trained with differentiable moving horizon estimation (MHE) that backpropagates gradients; learn using ground-truth locations instead of explicit ranging-error labels; incorporate Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps to further reduce labeling requirements; evaluate on public benchmarks and collected datasets; implement edge deployment for real-time performance.

Result: Shows notable improvements in positioning accuracy over baselines on public benchmarks and collected data; achieves real-time performance on mobile/edge devices.

Conclusion: End-to-end neural ranging correction with differentiable MHE and EDF supervision effectively mitigates GNSS ranging errors in urban environments, reduces labeling burden, and enables practical deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Organ-Agents introduces a multi-agent, LLM-driven digital twin of human physiology, with system-specific simulators trained on large ICU/sepsis datasets. It delivers high-fidelity multi-system trajectories, realistic event timing, clinician-validated realism, and useful counterfactuals for precision diagnosis and hypothesis testing, with preserved patterns in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for high-fidelity, interpretable digital twins that model interactions across multiple physiological systems in critical care, enabling safe hypothesis testing, treatment simulation, and decision support. Prior models struggle with coherence across systems and generalizability under distribution shifts.

Method: Organ-Agents comprises Simulator modules (one per physiological system, e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training involves supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. Data sources include 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, yielding trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Evaluation: 4,509 held-out patients (per-system MSEs <0.16) and external validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showing moderate degradation under distribution shifts but stable simulation. Clinician evaluation (15 critical-care physicians) reported realism (mean Likert 3.9/3.7). Counterfactuals under alternative treatments produced trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. Downstream tasks: synthetic-data-trained classifiers showed AUROC drops <0.04, indicating preserved decision-relevant signals.

Result: High-fidelity multi-system trajectories with plausible timing of events; robustness to distribution shifts; external validation shows only moderate degradation; clinicians judged realism credible; useful counterfactuals and preserved downstream predictive signals when trained on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Organ-Agents provides a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

### [121] [On the Interplay between Graph Structure and Learning Algorithms in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14338)
*Junwei Su,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical study linking graph structure to generalization in GNNs by deriving excess risk profiles for SGD and Ridge under noise, connecting to spectral graph theory, and comparing regular vs power-law graphs; extends to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing non-isotropic effects and providing empirical validation that supports a coupling among graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms with practical design implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory mostly analyzes learning dynamics in the interpolation regime with crude graph-structure connections (e.g., max degree). There is a gap in understanding how graph topology and spectrum influence generalization performance of GNNs under noise.

Method: Derive excess risk (generalization error) profiles for SGD and Ridge regression in GNN settings; link these profiles to the graph Laplacian spectrum via spectral graph theory; compare how different graph structures (regular vs power-law) affect the risks; extend analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs to study non-isotropic effects related to over-smoothing; validate predictions with experiments.

Result: Excess risk depends on spectral properties of the graph; regular and power-law graphs yield distinct generalization trajectories; deeper linear GNNs show increasing non-isotropic effects in excess risk, offering a learning-dynamics perspective on over-smoothing; empirical results align with the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the coupling between graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms.

Conclusion: There is a coupling among graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms that informs algorithm design and graph-aware GNN development. The work provides theoretical insights and practical guidance on how to select and design learning procedures and architectures in light of the underlying graph topology.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

### [122] [Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385)
*Kim Hammar,Tao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOBAL (Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning) offers an online Bayesian framework for incident response under model misspecification. It learns and refines a conjectured model during an attack and converts it into a finite Markov model for dynamic-programming-based planning, with theoretical guarantees and demonstrated robustness/ adaptability on the CAGE-2 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid decision-making during cyberattacks requires effective responses even when the attack model is incomplete or inaccurate. Traditional decision-support systems rely on detailed system models, which limits their practicality in fast-evolving incidents. MOBAL aims to enable online, model-adaptive planning under misspecification.

Method: MOBAL iteratively refines a conjectured model via Bayesian learning as new information arrives. The conjectured model is quantized into a finite Markov model to allow efficient planning through dynamic programming. The approach provides asymptotic consistency with respect to information feedback and derives bounds on misspecification and quantization errors.

Result: Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.

Conclusion: MOBAL provides a practical and theoretically grounded online planning framework for incident response under model misspecification, enabling faster, more robust decisions as events unfold and the model is refined.

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

### [123] [Exact Shapley Attributions in Quadratic-time for FANOVA Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14499)
*Majid Mohammadi,Krikamol Muandet,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette Ten Teije,Siu Lun Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact, scalable Shapley value computations for FANOVA Gaussian Processes: quadratic-time, exact local and global explanations with uncertainty via a closed-form Mobius/FANOVA representation and Newton-like recursions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley attributions are expensive and probabilistic models require higher moments. For structured probabilistic models like FANOVA GPs, there is a need for exact, scalable, uncertainty-aware explanations.

Method: Modeling with FANOVA GP that decomposes main effects and interactions. For local explanations, define a stochastic cooperative game over function components and compute exact stochastic Shapley values in quadratic time. For global explanations, use a deterministic, variance-based value function and compute exact Shapley values. Use a closed-form stochastic Möbius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and recursive algorithms inspired by Newton's identities to calculate mean and variance of Shapley values.

Result: Exact Shapley values for both local and global explanations are computed in quadratic time. Local explanations capture both expected contributions and uncertainty; global explanations quantify feature contributions to overall model sensitivity with a variance-based value. Methods are empirically validated, showing scalability and axiomatic soundness.

Conclusion: Provides scalable, uncertainty-aware explanations for structured probabilistic models (FANOVA GPs), enhancing explainable AI by delivering exact, efficient Shapley attributions for both local and global perspectives.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

### [124] [A Non-Asymptotic Convergent Analysis for Scored-Based Graph Generative Model via a System of Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14351)
*Junwei Su,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work provides the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) with coupled SDEs, covering three generation paradigms (features with fixed structure, structure with fixed features, and joint generation). It reveals graph-topology-related factors in the convergence bound, offers hyperparameter guidance (sampling steps, diffusion length), advocates normalization to improve convergence, and validates the theory with synthetic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGGMs are increasingly used in critical domains (e.g., drug discovery and protein synthesis). Unlike standard score-based models with a single SDE, SGGMs couple two SDEs for graph structure and node features, complicating convergence analysis. There is a need for non-asymptotic convergence bounds and practical guidance.

Method: Derive non-asymptotic convergence bounds for SGGMs under three generation paradigms: (i) feature generation with fixed graph structure, (ii) graph structure generation with fixed node features, (iii) joint generation of both. Analyze the influence of graph topology and interdependencies on the bound, and derive hyperparameter recommendations (sampling steps, diffusion length). Propose normalization techniques to improve convergence. Validate theoretical predictions with controlled experiments on synthetic graph models.

Result: The study yields explicit convergence bounds for SGGMs across the three paradigms and identifies topological properties of graphs as key factors shaping the error bound. It also provides practical guidelines for choosing hyperparameters (e.g., number of steps, diffusion length) and highlights normalization as a beneficial technique. Empirical results on synthetic graphs align with the theory.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their feasibility in critical applications, and offers actionable guidance for model design and training to achieve better convergence.

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

### [125] [SBGD: Improving Graph Diffusion Generative Model via Stochastic Block Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14352)
*Junwei Su,Shan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBGD introduces a block-graph diffusion space to reduce memory and improve size generalization for graph diffusion generative models, achieving up to 6x memory savings with competitive or better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome two key limitations of graph diffusion generative models: high memory requirements for training/inference on large graphs, and poor ability to generalize to graph sizes not seen during training.

Method: Propose stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) that refines graphs into a block-graph space with structural priors derived from real-world patterns, reducing memory usage and enhancing size generalization.

Result: SBGD achieves up to 6x memory reduction while maintaining or improving generation quality relative to state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrates better generalization to unseen graph sizes.

Conclusion: Modularizing generative modeling via a block-graph diffusion space offers scalable, size-generalizable graph generation and suggests a broader design principle of decomposing complex tasks into components.

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

### [126] [Beyond ReLU: Chebyshev-DQN for Enhanced Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14536)
*Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Shamim Sanisales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ch-DQN situates a Chebyshev polynomial basis within the DQN framework to create a richer feature representation for Q-value estimation. It shows that a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) yields substantial gains on CartPole-v1 (~39% improvement over a comparable DQN), while a higher degree (N=8) can hurt learning, indicating a critical hyperparameter trade-off between expressiveness and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve deep Q-learning performance by enhancing the neural network's function-approximation capabilities using an orthogonal polynomial basis, aiming for better sample efficiency and asymptotic performance.

Method: Integrate a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN architecture to form a richer feature representation of the state-action value function. Evaluate on CartPole-v1, comparing against a standard DQN with a similar parameter budget, varying the polynomial degree (N).

Result: Asymptotic performance improves significantly with a moderate degree (N=4), outperforming the baseline by about 39%. A high degree (N=8) can impair learning, highlighting a trade-off between model capacity and stability.

Conclusion: Orthogonal polynomial bases like Chebyshev polynomials are a promising avenue for deep reinforcement learning function approximation, but careful hyperparameter tuning (polynomial degree) is essential to reap benefits and avoid degradation.

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

### [127] [Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive LLM inference scheduling using interval-output-length predictions; two algorithms, A_max (conservative using upper bounds) and A_min (adaptive using lower bounds), with A_min achieving log-scale competitive ratio and robust practical performance near hindsight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize latency and memory risk in online, multi-task LLM inference under uncertain output lengths, by leveraging ML-predicted interval bounds for output tokens.

Method: Model output length as an interval prediction for each request. Develop A_max that schedules by the upper bound to avoid overflow, and A_min that starts with the predicted lower bound and adaptively refines the estimate during inference. Prove a log-scale competitive ratio for A_min and compare via simulations to a hindsight scheduler.

Result: A_min achieves a log-scale competitive ratio and frequently matches the performance of the hindsight scheduler in numerical simulations. A_min, relying only on the lower bound, is robust and practical, while A_max can be overly conservative when upper bounds are poorly predicted.

Conclusion: Adaptive, lower-bound–driven scheduling (A_min) is preferable for practical LLM inference under uncertain output lengths, offering strong theoretical guarantees and robust empirical performance; upper-bound based strategies are less reliable.

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

*Samarth Gupta,Raghudeep Gadde,Rui Chen,Aleix M. Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Disentangled diffusion in T-space enables training with far fewer latent steps, achieving competitive results with 32 steps and even with a single step; high-quality samples via combining independently trained single-state models; 4–6× faster convergence on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the core assumption that diffusion models require a large number of latent states (time-steps) for the reverse process to be near-Gaussian, enabling faster training and sampling by reducing T and exploiting disentanglement.

Method: Use a carefully selected noise schedule to train diffusion models with a small number of latent states (T ~ 32) and compare to models with many states (T ~ 1,000). Extend to a single latent-state (T = 1) to achieve complete disentanglement in T-space. Build a disentangled model by combining several independently trained single-state models and evaluate across datasets.

Result: Models trained with small T match the performance of large-T models. A single latent-state (T = 1) approach is feasible, and high-quality samples can be generated by combining independently trained single-state models. The proposed disentangled model shows 4–6× faster convergence across various metrics on two datasets.

Conclusion: Complete disentanglement in T-space is feasible, enabling modular, faster diffusion training. The results suggest that diffusion efficiency can be significantly improved by relaxing the need for many latent steps and leveraging ensembles of single-state models.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for personalized counterfactual modeling from multivariate wearable data enabling individual-specific what-if analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deriving actionable, individual-level insights from complex longitudinal wearable data; enable what-if scenario exploration to understand lifestyle effects.

Method: Augment data with similar patients via multi-modal similarity; adapt a temporal PC algorithm to identify predictive relationships from t-1 to t; train gradient boosting machines on these relationships to quantify individual-specific effects; use a counterfactual engine to project trajectories under hypothetical interventions; evaluate with one-step-ahead predictive validation and plausibility of interventions.

Result: Reasonable predictive accuracy (e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm); high counterfactual plausibility (median 0.9643); notable inter-individual variability in response to lifestyle changes.

Conclusion: Provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics, generate hypotheses about individual responses to lifestyle changes, and support personalized insights.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

*Andrew Murray,Danial Dervovic,Michael Cashmore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELATE uses a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate time-series feature engineering, achieving about 8.4% forecast accuracy gains across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual feature engineering for time-series is time-consuming and often domain-specific; exhaustive automation methods are computationally costly and may miss domain insights.

Method: An evolutionary framework where a language model proposes contextually relevant time-series feature transformations, guided by time-series statistics and feature importance to prune candidates and steer search.

Result: ELATE yields an average 8.4% improvement in forecasting accuracy over baselines across multiple domains.

Conclusion: Integrating language models with evolutionary feature engineering can efficiently produce high-quality, domain-relevant features for time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

### [131] [DuPO: Enabling Reliable LLM Self-Verification via Dual Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14460)
*Shuaijie She,Yu Bao,Yu Lu,Lu Xu,Tao Li,Wenhao Zhu,Shujian Huang,Shanbo Cheng,Lu Lu,Yuxuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuPO is a dual-learning framework that generates annotation-free feedback by reconstructing unknown components via a generalized dual task, enabling non-invertible tasks and improving LLM optimization across translation, math reasoning, and reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Targets the limitations of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which relies on costly labels and is restricted to verifiable tasks, and the tight constraints of traditional dual learning which requires strictly dual task pairs. DuPO broadens applicability by using a generalized dual reconstruction to provide self-supervised rewards.

Method: Decompose a primal task's input into known and unknown parts; construct a dual task that reconstructs the unknown part from the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing steps to recover hidden variables). Use the reconstruction quality as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task. A single model (LLMs) instantiate both tasks, enabling annotation-free learning.

Result: Empirically, DuPO improves translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, enhances mathematical reasoning accuracy by 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and boosts performance as an inference-time reranker by 9.3 points.

Conclusion: DuPO is a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for optimizing LLMs that broadens the scope of tasks that can benefit from duality-based feedback by leveraging generalized reconstruction as self-supervised rewards.

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

### [132] [AFABench: A Generic Framework for Benchmarking Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14734)
*Valter Schütz,Han Wu,Reza Rezvan,Linus Aronsson,Morteza Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFABench is the first standardized benchmark for Active Feature Acquisition (AFA), featuring diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, modular policies (static, greedy, RL), and a synthetic AFAContext to test lookahead; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standardized benchmark for AFA, making fair, systematic evaluation difficult as methods vary in acquisition costs, policies, and tasks.

Method: AFABench provides a modular benchmark framework that includes multiple datasets (synthetic and real-world), supports different acquisition policies (static, greedy, and reinforcement-learning-based), and introduces AFAContext—a synthetic dataset designed to stress lookahead capabilities. The paper implements and evaluates representative algorithms from major categories, and offers an extensible design to add new methods and tasks.

Result: The authors implemented and evaluated representative AFA algorithms within AFABench, highlighting trade-offs between acquisition strategies and providing actionable insights for future research; the framework and experiments demonstrate the value of standardized benchmarking in AFA.

Conclusion: AFABench enables fair, systematic evaluation of AFA methods, guiding future research by standardizing tasks, metrics, and benchmarks, and fostering extensibility for incorporating new methods and datasets.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

### [133] [Fast Symbolic Regression Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14481)
*Viktor Martinek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper refines SR benchmarks by replacing pursuit of a single expression form with curated sets of acceptable expressions and an early-termination callback, boosting rediscovery rates and cutting compute time for two SR tools (SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current symbolic regression benchmarks overemphasize recovering a single expression form, rely on computer algebra systems to judge success, and keep searching after discovery. There is a need for robust, fair, and compute-efficient benchmarking that reflects practical performance.

Method: Introduce curated lists of acceptable expressions, plus a callback mechanism to terminate searches early once a valid expression is rediscovered. Apply this to the SRSD benchmark problems and evaluate SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR.

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl rediscovery rate rises from 26.7% to 44.7% (as reported by Yoshitomo et al., now improved); computational expense reduced by 41.2%. TiSR achieves a rediscovery rate of 69.4% with 63% time savings during benchmarking.

Conclusion: Using curated expression sets and early termination in SR benchmarking yields higher rediscovery rates and substantial time savings, suggesting these practices produce fairer, more realistic assessments of SR methods and should be adopted more broadly.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

*Yunzhe Zhang,Yifei Wang,Khanh Vinh Nguyen,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCM-DLM enables cross-modality constrained molecule generation by adding two trainable modules (SCM, PCM) to a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, allowing new constraints without retraining; a two-phase generation anchors structure then refines properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world molecule design requires multiple constraints across modalities that evolve over time; retraining models for each new constraint is costly and impractical. A lightweight method to extend pre-trained models to new constraints is needed.

Method: Introduce Structure Control Module (SCM) and Property Control Module (PCM) plugged into a pre-trained SMILES-based diffusion model. Phase I uses SCM to impose structural constraints early to anchor the molecular backbone; Phase II uses PCM to guide property targets in later steps. Both modules are trainable while the base model remains frozen.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets show CMCM-DLM can efficiently and adaptively satisfy cross-modality constraints, improving generation quality and aligning properties without full retraining.

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM offers a practical, scalable approach for extending pre-trained diffusion models to new constraints across modalities, accelerating drug discovery workflows and enabling ongoing constraint updates without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

*Alexander Geiger,Lars Wagner,Daniel Rueckert,Dirk Wilhelm,Alissa Jell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual baselines generated by a variational autoencoder provide clinically normal but input-close baselines, improving attribution faithfulness in medical deep learning versus standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability in medical deep learning is hampered by semantically meaningless baselines (e.g., all-zero inputs). Missingness can be informative; there is a need for principled, input-specific baselines that reflect meaningful absence to build clinical trust.

Method: Introduce a counterfactual-guided baseline approach. Use a Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines that represent clinically normal, input-close absences of features. The idea is generative-model-agnostic and can be implemented with other counterfactual methods. Evaluate on three medical datasets.

Result: Counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions than standard baselines.

Conclusion: Clinically normal, input-close counterfactual baselines improve attribution fidelity in medical deep learning; the approach is generalizable beyond VAEs to other counterfactual methods and can enhance trust and transparency in clinical settings.

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepThink-R1 is an LLM-based framework that uses chain-of-thought fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to design cyclic peptides with interpretable, monomer-level edits and multi-property optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing therapeutic peptides is hindered by enormous sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of generative models; a method enabling interpretable design with multi-property optimization is needed.

Method: PepThink-R1 integrates large language models with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning and RL, enabling explicit monomer-level reasoning during sequence generation. It uses a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements to autonomously explore diverse cyclic-peptide variants, aiming to optimize lipophilicity, stability, and exposure.

Result: The approach yields cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baselines in optimization success and interpretability.

Conclusion: This work presents the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, advancing reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent

*Huan Ma,Jiadong Pan,Jing Liu,Yan Chen,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Guangyu Wang,Qinghua Hu,Hua Wu,Changqing Zhang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic Energy: a logits-based uncertainty framework using semantic clustering and Boltzmann energy to detect LLM hallucinations more robustly than semantic entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs hallucinate; existing uncertainty via semantic entropy is limited by relying on post-softmax probabilities; need a method that captures inherent uncertainty from logits.

Method: Operate on penultimate-layer logits; perform semantic clustering; define a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution over clusters; compute an uncertainty score (Semantic Energy) that signals potential hallucinations.

Result: Empirical results across multiple benchmarks show Semantic Energy improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation compared to semantic entropy and baseline methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Energy better captures intrinsic model confidence and provides more reliable uncertainty signals for downstream tasks like hallucination detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

*Lian Lian,Yilin Li,Song Han,Renzi Meng,Sibo Wang,Ming Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based anomaly detection method with integrated multiscale feature perception improves temporal modeling and scale-aware representation for cloud monitoring, achieving superior performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in high-dimensional cloud monitoring data, enabling accurate and robust anomaly detection across varying scales and perturbations.

Method: Use an improved Transformer for temporal modeling with self-attention; introduce a multiscale feature construction path via downsampling and parallel encoding; apply an attention-weighted fusion to adaptively combine scales; build standardized multidimensional input (CPU, memory, task scheduling) with positional encoding; evaluate through comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses (optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, noise).

Result: Outperforms mainstream baselines in precision, recall, AUC, and F1; maintains strong stability and detection performance under perturbations, indicating robust performance in complex cloud environments.

Conclusion: The architecture effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and multiscale patterns, delivering robust and accurate anomaly detection in cloud services.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

*Kevin Riehl,Shaimaa K. El-Baklish,Anastasios Kouvelas,Michail A. Makridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid physics-social bicycle trajectory predictor (Great GATsBi) that fuses physics-based and social graph models; demonstrates superior short- and long-term prediction and validates with mass-cycling experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bicycle safety is a critical issue and bicycles exhibit dual dynamics: physics-driven motion and social/pedestrian interactions. Existing work largely focuses on pedestrians and motorized vehicles, leaving bicycles under-studied; improving trajectory prediction can enhance ADAS/autonomous cycling.

Method: A domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal architecture that combines physics-based trajectory models with a graph attention network (GAT) to capture social interactions. The model uses decayed historical and anticipated future trajectories of neighboring bicycles. It follows insights from psychology/social studies and employs an ensemble where physics models perform better in short-term predictions and social models in long-term predictions; validated with a controlled mass-cycling experiment.

Result: The ensemble surpasses state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods, with physics components offering accuracy in the short term and social components improving long-term forecasts."

Conclusion: Demonstrates that integrating domain knowledge with social interaction modeling yields superior bicycle trajectory forecasting and validates the approach through a mass-cycling experiment, highlighting practical applicability for road safety and autonomous cycling systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

*Jiafeng Xiong,Rizos Sakellariou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTGIB combines Graph Structure Learning with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck to address inductive learning in dynamic graphs. It uses a two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich neighborhoods and a variational TGIB objective to regularize edges and features, yielding stable optimization. Empirically, GTGIB-based models achieve strong link prediction across four real datasets, outperforming baselines in both inductive and transductive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inductive representation learning on evolving graphs faces two main challenges: (1) representing unseen nodes effectively as the graph grows, and (2) mitigating noisy or redundant information in ever-changing neighborhoods. A framework that jointly learns robust structures and information-efficient representations for temporal graphs is needed.

Method: Introduce a two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods. Extend the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs (TGIB) and regularize both edges and features using a tractable TGIB objective derived via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. Combine these components in the GTGIB framework for inductive link prediction.

Result: The GTGIB-based models outperform existing methods on four real-world datasets for inductive link prediction and show significant, consistent improvements in the transductive setting as well. The approach is supported by theoretical insights and empirical validation, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: GTGIB offers a versatile, theoretically grounded framework that unifies Graph Structure Learning with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck to handle dynamic graphs with unseen nodes and noisy information, providing improved predictive performance and stable optimization.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

### [141] [FedEve: On Bridging the Client Drift and Period Drift for Cross-device Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14539)
*Tao Shen,Zexi Li,Didi Zhu,Ziyu Zhao,Chao Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedEve's predict-observe framework mitigates period drift and client drift in cross-device FL, improving convergence under non-iid data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In cross-device FL, data heterogeneity and partial client participation induce two drift phenomena: client drift from local updates and period drift due to varying participating client distributions; period drift can be more harmful as the optimization objective shifts each round.

Method: Introduce a predict-observe framework; instantiate FedEve that compensates both drift types during aggregation; provide theoretical analysis showing variance reduction of model updates; extensive experiments on noniid data showing performance gains.

Result: Theoretical results indicate reduced variance of updates; empirical results show FedEve outperforms alternatives in cross-device noniid settings.

Conclusion: Addressing both drift types via predict-observe enables more robust convergence and improved performance in cross-device FL; FedEve is an effective solution.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

### [142] [Cooperative SGD with Dynamic Mixing Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14565)
*Soumya Sarkar,Shweta Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for Local-Update SGD with dynamic topologies and non-uniform node contributions, yielding improved or matching convergence guarantees over fixed-topology analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed SGD with fixed topology and uniform client contributions often relies on strong assumptions that may be suboptimal in practice. Empirical results suggest that non-uniform aggregation, dynamic topology, and selective client participation can improve performance. A theory that covers these settings can unify and extend existing results.

Method: Introduce a unified theoretical framework that encompasses several Local-Update SGD–based distributed algorithms operating under dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation. Derive convergence guarantees under these general conditions, and compare to fixed-topology results.

Result: The framework provides improved or at least matching convergence guarantees relative to existing work, and supports dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation, aligning theory with observed empirical gains.

Conclusion: The proposed framework broadens the scope of provably convergent distributed SGD algorithms to include non-uniform contributions and topology dynamics, enabling potentially better-performing algorithms in practice.

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

### [143] [A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Sensitivity of Density-Ratio Estimation Based Fairness Measurement in Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14576)
*Abdalwahab Almajed,Maryam Tabar,Peyman Najafirad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Density-ratio based fairness measures in regression are highly sensitive to the chosen density-ratio estimator, potentially flipping fairness rankings and undermining reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing concern about algorithmic bias in ML and a gap in understanding how different density-ratio estimators affect fairness assessments in regression, which could mislead model selection and bias mitigation.

Method: The authors develop a family of fairness measurement methods built on various density-ratio estimation cores and perform thorough experiments to assess how the choice of core impacts fairness outcomes.

Result: The choice of density-ratio core can substantially alter fairness measurements and even invert the relative fairness of competing algorithms, highlighting reliability issues in density-ratio-based fairness assessment for regression.

Conclusion: Reliability of density-ratio-based fairness measures in regression is questionable; more research is needed to understand estimator sensitivity and to develop more robust, consistent fairness metrics.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

### [144] [DualNILM: Energy Injection Identification Enabled Disaggregation with Deep Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14600)
*Xudong Wang,Guoming Tang,Junyu Xue,Srinivasan Keshav,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based multi-task NILM framework (DualNILM) tackles both appliance state recognition and behind-the-meter energy injection identification, using sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies to model multi-scale temporal patterns, validated on self-collected and synthetic NILM datasets, and significantly outperforms traditional NILM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behind-the-meter energy sources (e.g., solar, batteries) inject energy that blends with appliance usage, obscuring signatures and degrading NILM performance. There is a need for models that can jointly identify energy injections and recognize appliance states.

Method: DualNILM is a deep multi-task learning framework with a Transformer-based architecture that integrates sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies. It captures multi-scale temporal dependencies to perform two tasks: (1) appliance state recognition and (2) energy injection identification, using both real and synthesized NILM datasets containing appliance-level data and injections.

Result: Extensive experiments show DualNILM achieves strong performance on both tasks and significantly outperforms conventional NILM methods across evaluated datasets.

Conclusion: DualNILM effectively addresses the challenge of behind-the-meter energy injections in NILM, enabling accurate appliance-state and injection identification, with implications for practical deployment and future extensions to broader datasets and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

### [145] [Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14615)
*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian and classical tests for IIA in similarity choice reveal significant context-driven violations; datasets show homogeneity; motivates context-aware models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IIA-based similarity models are common but may fail in real-world similarity judgments where target-dependent context effects influence choices. Quantifying and testing IIA violations is crucial for understanding and modeling such decisions.

Method: Two IIA tests: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian posterior predictive check (PPC). A third PPC-based test assesses population homogeneity. Analyses on two datasets (one designed to elicit IIA violations, and one with random choice sets) assess the prevalence and magnitude of IIA violations and context effects.

Result: Both datasets show significant IIA violations with comparable magnitudes. Population appears homogeneous, implying violations arise from within-set context interactions rather than population heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Context effects within choice sets drive IIA violations in similarity choice; results call for new models that incorporate context interactions beyond traditional IIA assumptions.

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

### [146] [A Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI Framework for Flight Continuous Descent Operations Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14618)
*Amin Noroozi,Sandaruwan K. Sethunge,Elham Norouzi,Phat T. Phan,Kavinda U. Waduge,Md. Arafatur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEXAI combines fuzzy logic, ML, and SHAP to explain and classify Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) adherence using ADS-B data, achieving >90% accuracy and yielding interpretable fuzzy rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparency in trajectory optimization for CDO, improve safety, trust, and operational decision support by providing interpretable explanations for ML predictions.

Method: Construct a dataset with 29 features (11 operational, 18 weather) from 1,094 flights via ADS-B. Train ML models and apply SHAP to rank feature importance for CDO adherence levels. Use the top features (as per SHAP) to build a fuzzy-rule based classifier that yields human-readable rules.

Result: All models achieve classification accuracies above 90%. SHAP identifies the average descent rate within the arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in heading during descent as the strongest predictors. The resulting fuzzy rules are interpretable for operational users, enabling real-time advisories to maintain CDO adherence.

Conclusion: The FEXAI framework offers a novel, transparent pathway for operational decision support in aviation, with potential integration into tools for real-time CDO adherence under varying conditions.

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

*Luis H. John,Jan A. Kors,Jenna M. Reps,Peter R. Rijnbeek,Egill A. Fridgeirsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hyperbolic (Poincaré) embeddings of SNOMED terms modestly boost lung cancer onset prediction when integrated into deep models; 10D Poincaré embeddings improve ResNet calibration, while Transformers show stable calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve semantic and hierarchical relationships among clinical concepts by embedding a clinical knowledge graph into hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and calibration.

Method: Build a SNOMED-derived clinical knowledge graph from Optum EHR data; generate Poincaré embeddings via Riemannian SGD; integrate these embeddings into ResNet and Transformer models; evaluate discrimination (AUC) and calibration (mean absolute error).

Result: Pre-trained Poincaré embeddings provide modest, consistent discrimination gains over random Euclidean embeddings. ResNet with 10-dimensional Poincaré embeddings improves calibration; Transformer models maintain stable calibration across configurations.

Conclusion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs in hyperbolic space and feeding these representations into deep networks can improve lung cancer onset prediction by preserving hierarchical clinical term structures, offering a feasible way to combine domain knowledge with data-driven learning.

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

*Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Xiuzhe Wu,Wang Wang,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Gui-Song Xia,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable second-order method (Diff-In) for estimating data-point influence by cumulatively tracking changes across training steps, achieving higher accuracy than existing estimators without convexity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data influence estimators often assume convex loss and suffer from accuracy issues in non-convex neural networks; there is a need for accurate, scalable data-centric analysis tools for data curation tasks (cleaning, deletion, coreset selection) in large-scale non-convex settings.

Method: Define per-sample influence as the cumulative sum of its changes in influence across successive training iterations. Use second-order approximations to approximate these difference terms without requiring convex loss. Compute the Hessian–gradient product efficiently via finite differences of first-order gradients, keeping computational complexity similar to first-order methods. The approach is designed to be scalable and applicable to large datasets.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows Diff-In achieves significantly lower approximation error than existing influence estimators. Extensive empirical evaluation across data-centric tasks (data cleaning, data deletion, coreset selection) demonstrates superior performance. In large-scale vision-language pre-training data pruning, Diff-In scales to millions of data points and outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: Diff-In provides accurate, scalable sample influence estimation without relying on convexity, enabling effective data-centric AI tasks such as cleaning, deletion, and coreset selection at scale.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

*Zengyi Wo,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Minglai Shao,Wenjun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual data augmentation for debiasing GNNs with adversarial discrimination, improving fairness with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs can be biased by sensitive attributes and graph structure; existing filtering/feature masking may remove non-sensitive but useful features, hurting accuracy. A method that preserves accuracy while improving fairness is needed.

Method: Generate diverse neighborhoods via counterfactuals before message passing and train with an adversarial discriminator to reduce bias in GNN predictions. The method, Fair-ICD, is evaluated on standard datasets using three GNN backbones.

Result: Fair-ICD improves fairness metrics while preserving predictive performance across multiple backbones on standard datasets.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD offers effective bias mitigation under moderate conditions by combining counterfactual data augmentation with adversarial training for GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CES2-GAD, a spectral GNN for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs using causal edge separation to split edges into homophilic/heterophilic parts, apply hybrid spectral filters, and fuse features for classification; demonstrates effectiveness on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with heterophily; while methods in the spatial domain exist, spectral-domain heterophily and the interplay between node structure, features, and context remain underexplored; there is a need to address spectral energy shifts caused by heterophily in anomalous networks.

Method: 1) Use causal interventions to separate the graph into homophilic and heterophilic edges. 2) Apply multiple hybrid-spectrum filters on the segmented graphs to capture signals at different frequencies. 3) Concatenate representations from multiple spectral signals and feed to a classifier for anomaly detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CES2-GAD in detecting anomalies on heterophilic graphs compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Spectral causal edge separation provides a viable route to model heterophily for anomaly detection, addressing spectral-domain challenges beyond existing spatial-domain methods.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

TL;DR: D-GSR refines large-language-model–generated graphs using downstream task data via the MissionHD hyperdimensional framework, improving video anomaly detection and related tasks as a preprocessing step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce reasoning graphs that misalign with downstream visual tasks; existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for novel, dataset-less graphs, creating a need for data-driven graph optimization.

Method: Introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR) and MissionHD. D-GSR optimizes graph structure directly using downstream task signals; MissionHD provides an efficient encode-decode process in a hyperdimensional computing framework to refine the graph.

Result: Experiments on challenging video anomaly detection (VAD) and video anomaly reduction (VAR) benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using the refined graphs as a preprocessing step.

Conclusion: D-GSR via the MissionHD framework offers an effective pre-processing approach to align graphs with downstream tasks and boost performance on challenging VAD/VAR benchmarks.

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

### [153] [Squeezed Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14871)
*Jyotirmai Singh,Samar Khanna,James Burgess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM) that inject anisotropic, data-aware noise guided by dataset structure (principal components), with two variants. Mild antisqueezing (increasing variance along the principal axis) improves generation quality (FID up to ~15% on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64) and PR recall, without changing model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage inherent data structure by shaping diffusion noise anisotropically, inspired by quantum squeezing and Heisenberg uncertainty, aiming to improve feature learning and sample quality without architectural changes.

Method: Introduce two configurations: (i) Heisenberg diffusion that scales the principal axis and inversely scales orthogonal directions, (ii) standard SDM that scales only the principal axis. Noise is scaled along the data's principal components (PCA-based), making the diffusion process data-dependent. Evaluate on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64 using FID and precision-recall metrics.

Result: Counterintuitively, mild antisqueezing (increasing variance on the principal axis) consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall across datasets, indicating robust gains from simple, data-aware noise shaping without architectural changes.

Conclusion: Data-aware, anisotropic noise shaping via SDM can yield robust generative gains for diffusion models without changing architecture, suggesting that respecting data structure during noise perturbation is a fruitful direction for model design.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

### [154] [HERAKLES: Hierarchical Skill Compilation for Open-ended LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14751)
*Thomas Carta,Clément Romac,Loris Gaven,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Olivier Sigaud,Sylvain Lamprier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HERAKLES introduces a two-level autotelic agent that uses an LLM high-level controller to decompose evolving subgoals and a small fast low-level network to compile mastered policies, enabling scalable open-ended goal learning and improved sample efficiency in Crafter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge that goal complexity and heterogeneity in open-ended agents cause uncontrolled growth in sample and computation. Existing HRL with fixed subgoal spaces and pre-trained low-level policies is inadequate for diversifying goal spaces.

Method: A two-level architecture where a Large Language Model serves as the high-level controller for goal decomposition and generalization, and a small fast neural network acts as the low-level policy that compiles mastered subgoals into reusable skills. The subgoal space expands dynamically over time, and skill compilation improves sample efficiency. Evaluation is performed in the Crafter open-ended environment.

Result: The approach scales with increasing goal complexity, improves sample efficiency via skill compilation, and enables robust adaptation to novel challenges over time.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that combining LLM-based high-level planning with dynamic subgoal compilation in HRL can support open-ended autotelic agents, suggesting a scalable path for learning hierarchies of goals and policies in evolving environments.

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

### [155] [Federated Distillation on Edge Devices: Efficient Client-Side Filtering for Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14769)
*Ahmed Mujtaba,Gleb Radchenko,Radu Prodan,Marc Masana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EdgeFD introduces a resource-efficient edge federated distillation framework that uses a KMeans-based density-ratio estimator to filter client proxy data, removing server-side filtering and reducing computation, achieving near-IID accuracy under strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID settings with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated distillation methods rely on complex density-ratio estimators and server-side filtering, which are computationally expensive and introduce latency. There is a need for a lightweight, privacy-preserving, edge-friendly approach that works under heterogeneous data distributions without requiring a pre-trained server teacher.

Method: Propose EdgeFD: a KMeans-based density-ratio estimator for client-side filtering of proxy data (both in- and out-of-distribution) without server-side filtering. The method reduces client-side complexity, does not require a pre-trained server teacher, and is evaluated across strong/weak non-IID and IID distributions, comparing against state-of-the-art.

Result: EdgeFD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy close to IID scenarios even under heterogeneous non-IID conditions, and exhibits significantly reduced computational overhead suitable for resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: EdgeFD provides a robust, scalable, and efficient solution for federated distillation, effectively filtering proxy data on the client side and eliminating server-side bottlenecks, with strong practical applicability and code availability for reproducibility.

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

### [156] [Context Steering: A New Paradigm for Compression-based Embeddings by Synthesizing Relevant Information Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14780)
*Guillermo Sarasa Durán,Ana Granados Fontecha,Francisco de Borja Rodríguez Ortíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces context steering to actively shape compression-based similarity features, producing task-tailored embeddings that emphasize class-distinctive information; validated on Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with hierarchical clustering, offering an alternative to transductive methods and showing robustness across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compression-based distances are flexible but derive features from data in an uncontrolled way; aligning these features with specific tasks (clustering/classification) is challenging, especially when the emergent structure may not suit the objective.

Method: Propose context steering: iteratively analyze how each object affects the relational context within a clustering framework, and from this create a custom-tailored embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. Validate with NCD/NRC using standard hierarchical clustering.

Result: Empirical results across heterogeneous datasets (text to real-world audio) show robustness and generality of context steering and suggest it as an effective alternative to common transductive methods.

Conclusion: Signals a fundamental shift from passively discovering inherent data structures to actively shaping a task-tailored feature space for a specific objective.

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

*Suleyman Olcay Polat,Poli A. Nemkova,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive, data-augmentation-driven distillation using UMAP-based loss-region sampling and a vectorized teacher-student interface yields a competitive 66M-parameter NLP student that matches or exceeds baselines on QNLI and SST-2 with fewer training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solve inefficiencies in conventional knowledge distillation: high computational overhead and limited generalization when compressing large models into small, deployment-friendly students.

Method: Identify underperforming regions in the student embedding space via UMAP dimensionality reduction and nearest-neighbor sampling. Generate targeted synthetic examples in high-loss regions to guide learning. Use a lightweight teacher-student interface that distills directly on vectorized representations by bypassing the teacher's input layer.

Result: A 66M-parameter student achieves competitive results across standard NLP benchmarks, e.g., 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, often matching or surpassing established baselines while requiring fewer training epochs.

Conclusion: Loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation offer an efficient path for model compression, delivering strong performance with reduced training costs. Further work could explore broader task coverage, ablations, and robustness to augmentation choices.

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

*Azim Ahmadzadeh,Rohan Adhyapak,Armin Iraji,Kartik Chaurasiya,V Aparna,Petrus C. Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A domain-agnostic, experience-based guide for planning and managing image annotation projects (with emphasis on scientific imagery), outlining key concepts, roles, biases, and practical guidelines to improve quality and reduce costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual image annotation is costly and complex, and practical guidelines are scarce, especially outside domain expertise. There is a need for a domain-agnostic framework to streamline annotation projects and make knowledge broadly available.

Method: Derived from the authors' extensive experience managing a large manual annotation project. The paper presents fundamental concepts (success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, essential team roles), discusses human biases, and recommends tools and technologies to improve quality and efficiency.

Result: A practical domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, especially in scientific imagery, coupled with actionable recommendations on workflows, bias mitigation, and tooling to enhance quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The work advocates for further research and development of frameworks and knowledge bases to reduce manual annotation costs across fields and to extend practical guidance to a broader set of domains.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

*Zifan Wang,Alice Harting,Matthieu Barreau,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFM shifts guidance from modifying the vector field to sampling from a modified source distribution, enabling exact target distribution with exact sampling and providing Wasserstein-error bounds under approximations; validated on synthetic and real tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and strengthen guidance for generative models by keeping the pre-trained vector field fixed and controlling the source distribution, enabling theoretical guarantees, flexible sampling, and compatibility with existing flow-matching methods.

Method: Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) modifies the source distribution directly while preserving the pre-trained vector field. Guidance becomes a sampling problem; the straight transport map from the vector field is preserved. The paper provides exact recovery guarantees and Wasserstein error bounds under approximate samplers/vector fields, compares sampling methods, and analyzes conditions for asymptotically exact guidance.

Result: The framework yields theoretical guarantees: SGFM recovers the target distribution exactly with exact components, and offers bounds on Wasserstein error when samplers and vector fields are approximate. Empirically, it shows effectiveness and flexibility on synthetic 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks; it integrates well with optimal flow matching due to preserved transport maps.

Conclusion: SGFM offers a flexible, theoretically grounded approach to guided generation that preserves the original vector field, enables diverse sampling strategies, and demonstrates practical effectiveness across domains.

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

*Chen-Hao Chang,Hui-Ju Hung,Chia-Hsun Lu,Chih-Ya Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical study and a degree-aware augmentation for contrastive link prediction, introducing Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA) and CoEBA, achieving state-of-the-art results on 8 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main gaps: (i) no formal theoretical analysis of contrastive learning in link prediction; (ii) node degree imbalance is not adequately considered in existing contrastive learning approaches.

Method: Provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, extend to autoencoder-based link prediction. Propose Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA) that adjusts node degrees as augmentation. Propose CoEBA combining EBA with new contrastive losses.

Result: Experimental evaluation on 8 benchmark datasets shows CoEBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Conclusion: Theory-guided, degree-aware augmentation improves link prediction; CoEBA offers a new effective framework.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

*Jihao Andreas Lin,Nicolas Mayoraz,Steffen Rendle,Dima Kuzmin,Emil Praun,Berivan Isik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Kronecker Gaussian Process-guided learning-curve predictions for Successive Halving show competitive results but are not Pareto-optimal due to reliance on fully observed curves; potential gains if existing learning-curve data is reused.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Successive Halving may prematurely prune slow-starting but eventually strong candidates because it relies on intermediate performance; learning-curve predictions could improve early stopping decisions.

Method: Develop Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes to predict full learning curves and use these predictions to guide resource allocation in Successive Halving; conduct a large-scale empirical study across different neural network architectures and a click-prediction dataset; compare predictive-guided SH to the standard SH using current performance values.

Result: The predictive approach achieves competitive performance but is not Pareto-optimal relative to investing more resources in the standard approach, mainly because it requires fully observed learning curves for training; potential mitigation if existing learning-curve data can be leveraged.

Conclusion: The predictive approach is promising, especially when abundant learning-curve data are available; its practical advantage hinges on the ability to access and reuse existing curves to bridge the gap with the standard approach.

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

*Su Hyeong Lee,Richard Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-free approach to synthesize a single neural network from multiple pretrained models using amortized meta-optimization; improves generalization and out-of-distribution performance over model soup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to merge models trained on separate data shards without access to training data to achieve ensemble-like gains, addressing limitations of naive averaging and standard model soup.

Method: Introduce Amortized Model Ensembling (AME); treat weight differences between pretrained models as pseudogradients to guide a meta-optimization that updates a single target network; unifies model soup as a special case and enables more expressive, adaptive ensembling under a data-free setting.

Result: Empirically, AME yields averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and model soup baselines, with pronounced gains in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, generalizable framework for data-free model weight aggregation and concrete procedures for neural averaging.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal Quantum Vision Transformer for EC classification integrating sequence embeddings, quantum descriptors, graph structures, and 2D images; achieves 85.1% top-1 accuracy, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enzyme function prediction is challenging with limited annotations/homology; leveraging diverse data sources and quantum-informed descriptors can better capture stereoelectronic determinants of function.

Method: A Quantum Vision Transformer (QVT) backbone with modality-specific encoders for four modalities: protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular graphs, and 2D molecular images; uses a unified cross-attention fusion module to integrate modalities and capture stereoelectronic interactions.

Result: Top-1 accuracy 85.1%, surpassing sequence-only baselines and competing QML models.

Conclusion: The multimodal QML framework improves EC classification, especially in data-scarce settings, by effectively fusing heterogeneous biochemical information.

Abstract: Accurately predicting enzyme functionality remains one of the major
challenges in computational biology, particularly for enzymes with limited
structural annotations or sequence homology. We present a novel multimodal
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC)
classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities:
protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular
graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind
enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model
achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other
QML models.

*Sajib Biswas,Mao Nishino,Samuel Jacob Chacko,Xiuwen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intrinsic optimization of relaxed one-hot encodings for LLM jailbreaks using exponentiated gradient descent with Bregman projection, achieving faster convergence and better transferable attack success across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreaks that bypass alignment; current methods either search discrete token spaces or optimize continuous embeddings, which do not generalize well to proprietary models. A method that operates directly on token-level decisions with convergence guarantees can improve attack efficiency and transferability, informing defense strategies.

Method: Optimize relaxed one-hot encodings of adversarial suffix tokens via exponentiated gradient descent with Bregman projection to keep the vectors in the probability simplex. The approach provides convergence proof, computes efficient suffixes (including universal ones) and demonstrates transferability across LLMs.

Result: Outperforms three state-of-the-art baselines on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial datasets, achieving higher attack success rates and faster convergence. It also yields universal suffixes effective across prompts and demonstrates cross-model transferability.

Conclusion: The intrinsic optimization framework offers a powerful way to generate effective jailbreak suffixes, highlighting a need for stronger defenses and prompting broader evaluation of LLM safety against optimization-based attacks, including cross-model transferability and universal suffix strategies.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

### [165] [Compute-Optimal Scaling for Value-Based Deep RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14881)
*Preston Fu,Oleh Rybkin,Zhiyuan Zhou,Michal Nauman,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes how to allocate compute for online, value-based deep RL by trading off model capacity and update-to-data (UTD) ratio. It uncovers TD-overfitting, where large batches hurt Q-function accuracy for small models but not for large models, and offers guidelines to maximize compute efficiency, aiming for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As models grow, compute-efficient scaling in reinforcement learning (RL) remains underexplored compared to supervised learning. The paper seeks to understand how to distribute compute between model size and update-to-data ratio to maximize sample efficiency in online, value-based deep RL.

Method: The authors analyze the interaction between model size, batch size, and update-to-data ratio (UTD) within online, value-based deep RL. They identify the TD-overfitting phenomenon and develop a mental model, supported by analysis and guidelines for selecting batch size and UTD to optimize compute usage.

Result: Identification of TD-overfitting: increasing batch size harms Q-function accuracy for small models but not for large models. Development of guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to maximize compute efficiency in compute-limited settings, and a framework to understand compute-optimal scaling in TD learning.

Conclusion: The paper provides a grounded starting point for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, extending concepts from supervised learning to TD methods, and suggesting practical guidelines for allocating compute between model capacity and data updates.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

### [166] [Research on UAV Applications in Public Administration: Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14096)
*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An enhanced dRRT improves UAV path planning in urban settings, delivering 100% success, faster runtimes, and smoother trajectories, at the cost of higher computation and potential local optima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize UAV path planning for energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints within governance infrastructure and smart city contexts.

Method: Proposes an enhanced dRRT with four strategies—Target Bias, Dynamic Step Size, Detour Priority, and B-spline smoothing—and evaluates it in a 500 m^3 urban simulation with randomized buildings, comparing against RRT, A*, and ACO while measuring success rate, runtime, path length, number of waypoints, and yaw smoothness.

Result: dRRT achieves a 100% success rate with an average runtime of 0.01468 s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and smoother trajectories (max yaw < 45 degrees); limitations include increased computational overhead and potential local optima due to goal biasing.

Conclusion: dRRT shows potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management tasks (e.g., emergency response, traffic monitoring) but requires integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks and contributes to interdisciplinary advances in urban governance, robotics, and optimization.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

### [167] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)
*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An RL method directly optimizes SE(2) target-reaching for humanoid locomotion using a constellation-based reward, coupled with a benchmarking framework; results show faster, energy-efficient, and robust short-range motion with sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion methods focus on velocity-tracking, which yields marching-like behavior and is inefficient for short-range pose reaching. There is a need to optimize for direct SE(2) target poses to improve practicality in real workspaces.

Method: Train a reinforcement learning policy with a novel constellation-based reward that emphasizes natural, efficient target-oriented movement toward SE(2) goals. Develop a benchmarking framework that evaluates energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count across a distribution of SE(2) goals and test sim-to-real transfer.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms standard methods across the benchmark and transfers successfully from simulation to hardware.

Conclusion: Targeted reward design is crucial for practical, short-range humanoid locomotion; the framework enables more efficient, robust, and real-world applicable SE(2) target-reaching behavior.

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

*Michal Ciebielski,Victor Dhédin,Majid Khadiv*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimization-based TAMP framework that unifies locomotion and manipulation via a shared contact-mode representation, enabling acyclic, whole-body planning for humanoid loco-manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge task planning and motion planning for loco-manipulation by incorporating dynamics and constraints into a unified search space.

Method: Represent actions as contact-mode changes and ground high-level plans in low-level motion, performing a unified search over task, contact, and motion with whole-body dynamics and environment constraints.

Result: Validated on a humanoid platform, producing a broad range of physically consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long sequences and demonstrating integrated acyclic TAMP with actuation constraints.

Conclusion: Claims to be the first work to realize fully acyclic integrated TAMP with whole-body dynamics and actuation constraints for humanoid loco-manipulation.

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

### [169] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CCGAN-based domain translation enables cross-domain transfer of soft-robot control policies, adapting a pose controller from standard simulation to a high-viscosity domain and validating across multiple shapes and noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots exhibit highly nonlinear, degraded dynamics and domain shifts; transferring learned policies across domains is hard due to differing physical properties and material aging; need methods that adapt controllers without manual re-tuning.

Method: A conditional cycle GAN (CCGAN) framework with GP (CCGAN-GP) learns cross-domain mappings between pressure inputs and end-effector states. It uses dynamic learning to adapt a pose controller trained in a baseline simulation to a target domain with tenfold higher viscosity, conditioning the generator on corresponding end-effector positions/orientations and pressure signals in both domains; cycle-consistency and gradient penalties stabilize training; evaluates trajectory-tracking across five shapes and tests robustness to noise and periodic perturbations.

Result: CCGAN-GP enables effective cross-domain skill transfer, preserving control performance across viscosity differences and shapes; improved robustness to noise and periodic perturbations observed in experiments.

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP offers a viable path toward adaptable and generalizable soft-robotic controllers capable of transferring learned policies across material/property changes, reducing re-engineering efforts for degradation or different morphologies.

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

### [170] [Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105)
*Jahid Chowdhury Choton,John Woods,William Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A customizable continuous-control multi-robot navigation environment formulated as an MDP, evaluated with diverse RL algorithms, showing robustness under uncertainty and providing guidance for real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot navigation in uncertain environments suffers from RL sample inefficiency and lack of formal guarantees; there is a need for well-designed, MDP-based environments that enable real-world deployment with limited resources.

Method: Create a flexible, continuous-control environment where multiple robots visit Regions of Interest (ROIs) along shortest paths, formalize the task as an MDP, and vary the environment. Evaluate both gradient and non-gradient RL methods (A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ, ARS). Validate real-world applicability by deploying in a 3D agricultural field with uncertainties using CoppeliaSim and testing inference robustness.

Result: The study demonstrates performance across a range of RL methods and validates robustness to environmental uncertainties; the environment is shown to be effective with limited resources and reasonable training time, providing practical guidance for building MDP-based environments for real-world multi-robot navigation.

Conclusion: Offers a framework and guidelines for designing MDP-based, real-world-applicable environments for multi-robot navigation and shows that existing RL methods can be applied effectively within constrained resources.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

### [171] [SimGenHOI: Physically Realistic Whole-Body Humanoid-Object Interaction via Generative Modeling and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14120)
*Yuhang Lin,Yijia Xie,Jiahong Xie,Yuehao Huang,Ruoyu Wang,Jiajun Lv,Yukai Ma,Xingxing Zuo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimGenHOI merges a DiT-based humanoid–object interaction generator with a contact-aware, reinforcement-learning–driven whole-body controller and a mutual fine-tuning loop to produce controllable, physically plausible HOIs for long-horizon tasks, addressing artifacts like penetrations and foot sliding while improving tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based HOI generation often yields artifacts (implausible contacts, penetrations, unrealistic full-body actions) that impede real-world execution; there is a need for controllable, physically plausible HOIs, especially for long-horizon manipulation in robotics.

Method: A Diffusion Transformer–based HOI generator conditions on text prompts, object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and initial humanoid pose to predict key actions, which are interpolated into smooth trajectories. A contact-aware whole-body control policy trained via reinforcement learning tracks these motions and corrects artifacts (penetration, foot sliding). A mutual fine-tuning loop lets the generative model and control policy iteratively refine each other to boost realism and tracking robustness.

Result: Experiments show the approach generates realistic, diverse, and physically plausible HOIs with higher tracking success rates in simulation and capability for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SimGenHOI presents a unified framework that combines generative modeling and RL for controllable, physically grounded HOI generation; mutual refinement between the generator and controller yields improved motion realism and robustness, with code to be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

*Evanns Morales-Cuadrado,Luke Baird,Yorai Wardi,Samuel Coogan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-world evaluation of a flow-based Newton-Raphson tracking controller on a miniature blimp and a mid-size quadrotor shows robust tracking with lower computation time and energy compared to baseline controllers (feedback linearization for the blimp and NMPC for both platforms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether a theoretically attractive flow version of Newton-Raphson tracking can deliver practical, energy-efficient real-time performance under onboard computation constraints on aerial vehicles.

Method: Implement the flow-based NR tracker; compare against feedback linearization (blimp) and NMPC (quadrotor and blimp); conduct real-world flight experiments; evaluate RMS trajectory error, computation time, and CPU energy consumption.

Result: The NR flow tracker achieves comparable or superior tracking performance with substantially reduced computation time and energy consumption across platforms.

Conclusion: Flow-based Newton-Raphson tracking is viable and advantageous for real-world aerial systems under resource constraints, offering performance parity with established controllers while saving time and energy.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A non-point, circular-footprint mobile robot with dual-wheel differential drive uses RTAB-SLAM with LiDAR/IMU and camera loop closures, guided by a safe skeleton exploration to stay away from obstacles and move toward openings, validated with ROS experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address exploration by realistic agents with limited maneuverability and safety constraints in cluttered planar environments, improving mapping and exploration without relying on instantaneous pose changes.

Method: A self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive platform (with IMU, angular rate sensor, 3D LiDAR, and forward RGB-D camera) performs RTAB-SLAM using IMU+LiDAR data; camera used for loop closures. Exploration uses a safe skeleton strategy that keeps the agent far from static obstacles and heads toward visible openings, prioritizing safety over exploration.

Result: Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed path planning strategy during exploration and show safe navigation and mapping in cluttered spaces.

Conclusion: The paper presents a safe, obstacle-averse exploration approach for non-point robots in 2D planar environments, validated experimentally with ROS, highlighting the importance of sensor fusion and a skeleton-based planning strategy.

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

*Daegyun Choi,Alhim Vera,Donghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A biomimetic approach uses lizard air-righting trajectories, extracted via video and optimized to serve as reference motions for space manipulator control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address microgravity dynamic coupling between a spacecraft base and a space manipulator by leveraging evolved animal behaviors to develop interpretable, adaptive control strategies for SMSs.

Method: Extract air-righting motion trajectories from high-speed video with computer vision; analyze these trajectories in a multi-objective optimization framework to identify key behavioral goals and their relative importance; apply the resulting motion profiles as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers tasked to track them.

Result: Identified key behavioral goals and their relative importance; demonstrated feasibility of using animal-derived trajectories as reference motions for SMS control, implying potential improvements in maneuverability and robustness.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired trajectories offer a promising path to translating evolved animal behaviors into practical, adaptive control strategies for space robotics, enhancing maneuverability and robustness in future missions.

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

*Guodong Yao,Hao Wang,Qing Chang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive LiDAR-inertial odometry with an outlier-tolerant threshold and IMU-informed scan-to-submap registration to handle feature degeneracy; shows robustness and accuracy gains across indoor/outdoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR feature degeneracy degrades state estimation in LIO systems. There is a need for robust outlier handling and explicit geometry-aware fusion of IMU data to improve pose estimation under degeneracy.

Method: 1) Adaptive outlier removal threshold that depends on point-to-sensor distance and platform motion amplitude; 2) Flexible scan-to-submap registration leveraging IMU data to refine pose in degenerate configurations; 3) A novel weighting matrix that fuses IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric from the scan-to-submap process.

Result: Extensive experiments in indoor and outdoor environments with sparse or degenerate features show the proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding and IMU-informed scan-to-submap with a degeneration-aware weighting framework enhance LIO performance in challenging degeneracy scenarios, improving reliability and localization accuracy across varying feature richness.

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ACIL aims to learn from an expert with a larger action space when action constraints cause occupancy mismatch. It proposes DTWIL to align trajectories by generating a surrogate constrained dataset, solved via MPC to minimize DTW distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core challenge is the occupancy measure mismatch between expert and imitator due to action constraints, which hinders effective imitation learning in safe robot control and resource allocation tasks.

Method: Formulate trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve with Model Predictive Control to produce surrogate trajectories that follow similar state trajectories while respecting action constraints; align these surrogates with expert trajectories using Dynamic Time Warping distance.

Result: DTWIL-generated data improves imitation learning performance and sample efficiency across several robot control tasks, outperforming various benchmark imitation learning methods.

Conclusion: Trajectory alignment via DTW distance and MPC-based planning provides an effective approach for action-constrained imitation learning, enabling safer, more sample-efficient learning; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

### [177] [Fair-CoPlan: Negotiated Flight Planning with Fair Deconfliction for Urban Air Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14380)
*Nicole Fronda,Phil Smith,Bardh Hoxha,Yash Pant,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan is a semi-distributed UAM flight planner that allocates fair path lengths among competing operators by constraining vertiport capacity, enabling independent operator planning, and jointly resolving conflicts for fairness, with simulation results showing better fairness at the cost of small delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAM flight planning can yield disproportionate path lengths for some operators, reducing participation and potentially compromising safety. A fair, shared-airspace planning approach is needed to ensure equitable access and safer operations.

Method: 1) PSU constrains take-off/landing choices based on vertiport capacity. 2) Operators plan independently within those constraints. 3) PSU resolves conflicting paths, optimizing for path-length fairness and distributing deconfliction costs to encourage participation.

Result: Simulation experiments show Fair-CoPlan achieves fairer path-length outcomes than a non-fair planner, with only minor delays as a trade-off.

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan promotes wider operator participation, maintains airspace safety, and provides greater flexibility for UAM by prioritizing fairness in path planning.

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

### [178] [FiReFly: Fair Distributed Receding Horizon Planning for Multiple UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14381)
*Nicole Fronda,Bardh Hoxha,Houssam Abbas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FiReFly: a distributed fair motion planner for multi-robot systems that aims to allocate energy expenditure fairly while maintaining mission success; demonstrates fairness improvements and mission success gains in simulated reach-avoid tasks; real-time up to 15 UAVs and scalability to 50 with trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-robot operations, robots often compete for limited energy resources. Fairly distributing energy expenditure among robots can prevent domination by a subset of robots, extend mission duration, and improve overall team performance without sacrificing success.

Method: Develop a distributed fair motion planner integrated with safe controllers to form FiReFly. The planner optimizes for fairness in energy expenditure while ensuring mission success, and is evaluated in simulated reach-avoid missions. It analyzes real-time performance and scalability up to 50 UAVs, examining trade-offs between runtime and fairness gains.

Result: FiReFly yields fairer trajectories compared to a non-fair planner and improves mission success rates in simulated reach-avoid missions. Real-time performance is achievable up to 15 UAVs; with larger teams (up to 50 UAVs), scalability is possible but requires trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvement.

Conclusion: Injecting fairness into multi-robot motion planning is feasible and beneficial, enabling fair resource usage without compromising mission success. FiReFly demonstrates practical real-time operation for moderate-sized teams and scalable performance with trade-offs for larger swarms.

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Motivation: Limited expert data hinder offline IL; want to exploit replayable data from same dynamics; reduce downstream learnable parameters by working in a representation space.

Method: Pre-training stage learns dynamics representations via factorization of transition dynamics; represent optimal decision variable in representation space; uses a tractable NCE-style loss; can use arbitrary data from same dynamics (e.g., simulator data) to pre-train; downstream IL reduces parameter count; experiments in MuJoCo and real quadrupeds.

Result: Achieves expert-like policies with as few as one trajectory in MuJoCo; demonstrates sim-to-real learning of walking from a handful of real demonstrations using pre-trained dynamics representations.

Conclusion: Learning dynamics representations is an effective way to mitigate limited expert data in offline IL; enables efficient transfer from simulator data to real robots; suggests broader applicability of NCE-inspired pre-training for dynamics.

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

*Yuxiao Zhu,Junfeng Chen,Xintong Zhang,Meng Guo,Zhongkui Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A four-module framework (DEXTER-LLM) for online, explainable dynamic task planning in unknown environments, merging LLM-based scene reasoning with model-based task assignment to achieve robust, scalable multi-robot coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing LLM-based planning approaches that are one-shot and end-to-end in known environments, lacking online adaptability and explainability when new semantic features trigger tasks.

Method: (i) mission comprehension to resolve partial task ordering via natural language or LTL; (ii) online subtask generator using multi-stage LLM reasoning for better decomposition and explainability; (iii) optimal subtask assigner/scheduler with search-based optimization; (iv) dynamic adaptation + human-in-the-loop verification with multi-rate, event-driven updates to handle new features/tasks online.

Result: Experiments report 100% success across scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (three times baselines), 62% fewer LLM queries during adaptation, and compound-task plan quality twice as high as baselines.

Conclusion: DEXTER-LLM demonstrates that integrating open-world LLM reasoning with model-based optimization yields online adaptability and explainability in unknown environments, offering a promising direction for real-time multi-robot coordination; project page: https://tcxm.github.io/DEXTER-LLM/

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

*Yijin Chen,Wenqiang Xu,Zhenjun Yu,Tutian Tang,Yutong Li,Siqiong Yao,Cewu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flow Before Imitation (FBI) fuses tactile flow with vision using a dynamics-aware latent and a transformer module to train a one-step diffusion policy for real-time dexterous in-hand manipulation, outperforming baselines in simulation and real robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is hard due to complex contact dynamics and partial observability; relying on a single modality limits adaptability; integrating vision and touch with motion dynamics can improve robustness.

Method: Proposes FBI framework, dynamics-aware latent model linking tactile signals to object motion; uses a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile features with visual inputs; trains a one-step diffusion policy for real-time execution; includes flow-derived tactile features (likely from optical flow) used to connect tactile signals with object motion.

Result: Extensive experiments show FBI outperforms baselines on two customized in-hand tasks and three standard dexterous tasks, in both simulation and real-world; code and results available on project site.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that causally linking tactile signals to object motion via a dynamics-aware latent, together with visuotactile fusion and diffusion-based control, improves dexterous manipulation and enables real-time execution.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Abstract: This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service
Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a

pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container
with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the

*Xinkai Liang,Yigu Ge,Yangxi Shi,Haoyu Yang,Xu Cao,Hao Fang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EAROL is a hardware–algorithm co-design framework for UAV localization and perception in open-top environments, using a downward-tilted 20° LiDAR with LIO (IESKF) and a hierarchical trajectory-yaw planner to reduce drift and improve perception; validated indoors and at 60 m outdoors with open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In open-top UAV scenarios (e.g., collapsed buildings, roofless mazes) localization drift and perception-planning coupling hinder autonomy. Dense ground-point constraints and forward environmental awareness are needed for robust, accurate 6-DoF localization and obstacle handling in feature-sparse or dynamic environments, especially for post-disaster search and rescue.

Method: Deploy a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR (20°) integrated with a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) using an Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter (IESKF) with dynamic motion compensation. Enhance constraints with dense ground-point cloud data and forward environmental awareness. Use a hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization planner balancing exploration, tracking precision, and energy efficiency. Provide hardware–algorithm co-design and release open-source software/hardware.

Result: Experiments show 81% reduction in tracking error, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift in indoor maze and 60 m outdoor tests. The system supports robust UAV autonomy in post-disaster scenarios with dynamic obstacle handling.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a hardware–algorithm co-design paradigm that robustly improves UAV localization and perception in challenging open-top environments, suitable for post-disaster search and rescue; the authors plan to release the package as open-source.

Abstract: To address the challenges of localization drift and perception-planning
coupling in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in open-top scenarios

framework with a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR configuration (20{\deg}
inclination), integrating a LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) system and a
hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization algorithm. The hardware innovation
enables constraint enhancement via dense ground point cloud acquisition and
forward environmental awareness for dynamic obstacle detection. A
tightly-coupled LIO system, empowered by an Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter

Conclusion: TRUST-Planner effectively addresses local minima and deadlock in dynamic environments, providing robust, fast, topology-guided planning for AAVs and demonstrating practicality for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial
vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and
deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is

*João Vitor de Carvalho Silva,Douglas G. Macharet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM-based agents can coordinate in a graph-based victim-rescue task, but their effectiveness depends on coordination-sensitive metrics; the work highlights strengths, weaknesses, and the need for benchmarks to guide improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models can extend to physically grounded, multi-agent collaboration, quantify their coordination performance, and identify failure modes to inform benchmarks and architecture.

Method: A structured victim-rescue task in a fully known graph environment where multiple LLM agents must divide labor, prioritize victims with varying needs and urgency, and cooperatively plan resource allocation. Evaluation uses metrics sensitive to coordination: task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency.

Result: LLMs demonstrate planning and communication capabilities that support collaboration but exhibit notable coordination shortcomings (e.g., redundant actions, room conflicts). The findings offer insights into strengths and failure modes, informing the design of future benchmarks and architectural improvements.

Conclusion: LLM agents can aid multi-agent collaboration in physically grounded tasks but require careful benchmarking and targeted architectural refinements to mitigate coordination flaws and achieve robust performance.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

*Sanjeev Ramkumar Sudha,Marija Popović,Erlend M. Coates*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive planning framework for tracking multiple drifting targets using a spatiotemporal prediction network, combining information-driven path planning with real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently tracking moving targets in dynamic, disturbance-driven environments is essential for applications like search & rescue and environmental cleanup. Targets drift due to wind and currents, making spatial-temporal prediction crucial for informative mapping.

Method: Develop a planning framework that (i) uses a spatiotemporal prediction network to forecast target position distributions over time, and (ii) employs an adaptive planning objective that leverages these predictions to guide target tracking, enabling handling of an arbitrary number of targets with unknown initial positions.

Result: Simulation experiments show that the adaptive planning objective improves target tracking performance over entropy-only planning. Field tests with an autonomous surface vehicle validate the approach in real-world monitoring scenarios.

Conclusion: An adaptive, prediction-informed information planning approach can effectively track drifting targets in dynamic environments and is viable for real-world monitoring using mobile robotic platforms.

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

*Alexander Raab,Stephan Weiss,Alessandro Fornasier,Christian Brommer,Abdalrahman Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces the Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF) for terrestrial vehicle localization, achieving higher consistency and long-term accuracy by using a pose manifold, domain-aware measurement models, and a novel correction scheme, validated via Monte Carlo simulations and showing reduced tuning requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EKF-based localization can suffer from inconsistency and degraded long-term accuracy; conventional representations may impose artificial constraints or ignore ground geometry. A manifold-based pose representation and correction scheme aim to improve consistency across various sensors and real-world conditions without heavy tuning.

Method: Develops M-ESEKF with reduced-dimensional pose representation on a manifold, compatible measurement models for loose/tight coupling, implicit ground geometry handling, and a correction scheme that injects domain knowledge into sensor data; integrated into a modular state estimation framework.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios show improved consistency and stability over classical filters; better uncertainty modeling; no need for scenario-specific parameter tuning.

Conclusion: M-ESEKF significantly improves consistency and robustness of terrestrial vehicle localization, integrates with existing frameworks, and is ready for broad real-world deployment.

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A safety-and-transparency framework for general-purpose collaborative meat-processing robots, combining hand-detection safety, instrumented knife with force sensing, uncertainly signaling via LED, and a human-in-the-loop GUI; validated in a user study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labor shortages in meat processing and limited existing automation; need versatile, cost-effective, human-friendly robots that can perform multiple tasks with safety and transparency.

Method: Develop framework: near-hum an hand-detection to halt robot; instrumented knife with force sensor to classify contact; LED-based uncertainty communication; graphical interface showing robot plans and collecting human feedback; user study validation.

Result: Demonstrated safe operation and human-in-the-loop transparency; the framework enables robots to work alongside humans across tasks; user study confirms usability and understanding of robot behavior.

Conclusion: General-purpose collaborative meat-processing robots can be safely integrated with human workers through sensing, transparent communication, and interactive planning interfaces, potentially reducing costs and increasing flexibility.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

### [189] [Lagrangian Simulation Volume-Based Contour Tree Simplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14339)
*Domantas Dilys,Hamish Carr,Steven Boeing*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Extends volume-based contour-tree simplification to parcel-in-cell simulations by using Delaunay tetrahedralization and area-spline methods, yielding orders-of-magnitude faster contour trees with better segmentation compared to grid resampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to filter small-scale features in contour trees for parcel-based simulations efficiently without resorting to expensive resampling on uniform grids.

Method: Build Delaunay tetrahedralization of parcel centroids; adapt 2D area splines to compute a volume-like integrable measure; implement in Viskores with prefix-sum style hypersweeps; generalize to any integrable property.

Result: Contour trees computed directly on parcels are orders of magnitude faster than on resampled grids; improved segmentation quality by avoiding interpolation artifacts.

Conclusion: The approach yields substantial performance gains and can be generalized to other integrable properties in parcel-based simulations.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar
fields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles
(Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as
contour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out
small-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,
simplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than
persistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting
regular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data
onto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a
high sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for
processing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to
parcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using
Delaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of
relying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done
for cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.
10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement
this in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for
parallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any
integrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed
directly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a
resampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,
avoiding interpolation artifacts.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: This work defines an extended Gaussian family by including degenerate covariance/precision cases, models the parameter space as an SDP bicone, derives a closed-form Hilbert distance on this domain, analyzes its invariance properties, and discusses potential use for extended Gaussian distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accommodate degeneracy in Gaussian models and understand a natural metric structure on the resulting parameter space, enabling robust comparison and inference for extended Gaussians.

Method: Characterizes parameter space as a symmetric positive semi-definite bicone; treats it as an open bounded convex symmetric domain; derives closed-form Hilbert metric distance on this domain; studies invariance under natural symmetries (scaling, congruence, etc.).

Result: Providing a closed-form formula for the Hilbert metric distance on the extended Gaussian bicone; exhaustive analysis of invariance properties; potential application discussion.

Conclusion: The extended Gaussian parameter space has a tractable Hilbert geometry with explicit distance and symmetry structure, which may facilitate statistical methods for extended Gaussian distributions; future work suggested on practical applications and extensions.

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric
positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

### [191] [An Algorithm for Computing the Exact Convex Hull in High-Dimensional Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14407)
*Qianwei Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A high-dimensional convex hull algorithm that iteratively solves per-point quadratic programs to exactly identify the hull, with best-case O(n m^p) and worst-case O(n h^{p+1}) complexities, enabling scalable hull computation on large, high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for exact convex hull computation in high dimensions where combinatorial hull enumeration is infeasible; existing methods struggle with scalability on large, high-dimensional datasets.

Method: For each point, iteratively solve a sequence of dynamically updated quadratic programs. The QP solutions are used to determine hull membership and identify hull vertices, with guarantees for exact convex hull identification. The overall complexity depends on the chosen QP solver (e.g., interior-point methods).

Result: The approach provides theoretical guarantees for exact hull identification and presents complexity bounds that scale with the data size and dimension. It is positioned as particularly suitable for large-scale, high-dimensional datasets where exponential-time hull algorithms are impractical.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, exact convex hull computation strategy in high dimensions, contingent on efficient QP solving. Effectiveness improves when the hull size h is modest; performance hinges on the efficiency of the underlying QP solver.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel algorithm for computing the convex hull of a
point set in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method iteratively solves a
sequence of dynamically updated quadratic programming (QP) problems for each
point and leverages the solutions to provide theoretical guarantees for exact
convex hull identification. Given $n$ points in an $m$-dimensional space, the
algorithm achieves a best-case time complexity of $O(nm^p)$, where $p$ depends
on the specific QP solver employed (e.g., an interior-point method). In the
worst case, the complexity increases to $O(n h^{p+1})$, where $h$ denotes the
minimal number of vertices defining the convex hull. The approach is
particularly well-suited for large-scale, high-dimensional datasets, where
exponential-time algorithms become computationally infeasible.

### [192] [Morse-based Modular Homology for Evolving Simplicial Complexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14429)
*Anqiao Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces MMHM, a Morse-based modular framework for maintaining homology under local edits in evolving simplicial complexes, enabling fast, exact updates without full recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic or frequently updated complexes require repeated boundary recomputation, which is costly. The goal is to preserve homological invariants while updating only affected regions.

Method: Develop MMHM: start with a discrete Morse reduction to a critical-cell complex; upon edits, perform localized updates to the reduced boundary operators over a chosen coefficient ring. Use a periodic recompression policy, topology-aware gating, and a column-oriented sparse representation with a pivot-ownership map to confine eliminations to affected columns and sometimes avoid linear algebra if invariants are decidable combinatorially.

Result: Achieves significant amortized performance gains with exact homology preservation, acting as a drop-in upgrade for topology pipelines and enabling fast, local updates instead of full rebuilds.

Conclusion: Dynamic homology can be reframed as a locality-bounded maintenance task, providing an exact, efficient alternative to global recomputation for evolving meshes and complexes.

Abstract: The computation of homology groups for evolving simplicial complexes often
requires repeated reconstruction of boundary operators, resulting in
prohibitive costs for large-scale or frequently updated data. This work
introduces MMHM, a Morse-based Modular Homology Maintenance framework that
preserves homological invariants under local complex modifications. An initial
discrete Morse reduction produces a critical cell complex chain-homotopy
equivalent to the input; subsequent edits trigger localized updates to the
affected part of the reduced boundary operators over a chosen coefficient ring.
By restricting recomputation to the affected critical cells and applying
localized matrix reductions, the approach achieves significant amortized
performance gains while guaranteeing homology preservation. A periodic
recompression policy together with topology-aware gating and a column-oriented
sparse boundary representation with a pivot-ownership map confines elimination
to the affected columns and can bypass linear algebra when invariants are
decidable combinatorially. The framework offers a drop-in upgrade for topology
pipelines, turning costly rebuilds into fast, exact updates that track homology
through local edits. Reframing dynamic homology as a locality-bounded
maintenance task provides an exact alternative to global recomputation for
evolving meshes and complexes.

### [193] [The Rectilinear Marco Polo Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14820)
*Ofek Gila,Michael T. Goodrich,Zahra Hadizadeh,Daniel S. Hirschberg,Shayan Taherijam*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Marco Polo problem to rectilinear (L1/L∞) settings, proposing and analyzing several efficient search strategies to move a search point until it is within distance 1 of a POI, with performance characterized by the domain size n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by urban geometry and search-and-rescue applications, it aims to localize POIs efficiently in rectilinear spaces while minimizing probes and travel distance, and extends the problem to higher dimensions.

Method: The authors describe multiple efficient search strategies for rectilinear Marco Polo problems. For each strategy, they analyze performance in terms of the search domain size n (the maximum POI distance from the origin). The procedure uses an agent Delta that periodically probes from the origin outward by a specified L1 or L∞ distance; if a POI lies within that probe radius, this is learned (but no full location is revealed). The work evaluates the number of probes and travel distance required by each strategy.

Result: Several efficient rectilinear Marco Polo strategies are introduced and analyzed. Each strategy's performance is characterized as a function of n, providing theoretical bounds or growth rates for the required probes and travel distance (no empirical results reported).

Conclusion: The work provides a foundational set of efficient strategies for rectilinear Marco Polo localization in L1/L∞ spaces and lays groundwork for higher-dimensional extensions, with explicit analysis of probe counts and travel distance as functions of the search domain size.

Abstract: We study the rectilinear Marco Polo problem, which generalizes the Euclidean
version of the Marco Polo problem for performing geometric localization to
rectilinear search environments, such as in geometries motivated from urban
settings, and to higher dimensions. In the rectilinear Marco Polo problem,
there is at least one point of interest (POI) within distance $n$, in either
the $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ metric, from the origin. Motivated from a
search-and-rescue application, our goal is to move a search point, $\Delta$,
from the origin to a location within distance $1$ of a POI. We periodically
issue probes from $\Delta$ out a given distance (in either the $L_1$ or
$L_\infty$ metric) and if a POI is within the specified distance of $\Delta$,
then we learn this (but no other location information). Optimization goals are
to minimize the number of probes and the distance traveled by $\Delta$. We
describe a number of efficient search strategies for rectilinear Marco Polo
problems and we analyze each one in terms of the size, $n$, of the search
domain, as defined by the maximum distance to a POI.

### [194] [Large Language Models are Highly Aligned with Human Ratings of Emotional Stimuli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14214)
*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o aligns closely with human emotional ratings across words/images, especially in a five-emotion framework; arousal less aligned; happiness best aligned; LLMs are more homogeneous than humans; implications for AI as proxies in emotion-heavy tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli and how their alignment with human emotion processing affects their potential roles as proxies or collaborators in everyday tasks.

Method: Ratings were elicited from multiple popular LLMs for word- and image-based datasets previously rated by humans for emotional content. Comparisons were made across modalities, stimuli, and rating scales; analyzed alignment within a five-category emotion framework (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) versus a two-dimensional arousal/valence model; correlation metrics (e.g., r values) used to quantify alignment and assessed rating homogeneity.

Result: GPT-4o's ratings closely track human ratings (often r ≥ 0.9) across most conditions, but arousal ratings show weaker alignment; happiness ratings show the strongest alignment. LLM ratings are substantially more homogeneous than human ratings. Alignment is stronger within the five-category emotion framework than in the two-dimensional arousal/valence space.

Conclusion: LLMs can interpret emotional stimuli in a manner broadly consistent with humans for common affective judgments, especially within a discrete five-emotion taxonomy, but exhibit systematic differences (notably in arousal) and greater response consistency. These findings inform when and how LLMs might serve as proxies or interactants in emotion-related tasks and highlight differences between biological and artificial emotion processing.

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

### [195] [Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14294)
*Maria Leonor Pacheco,Fabio Somenzi,Dananjay Srinivas,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic framework that merges SAT-based reasoning with LLMs to explain complex decision sequences, demonstrated on Hitori puzzle solutions; local constraints are explained via short resolution proofs, while the connectivity constraint benefits from visual explanations; a solving assistant is implemented and experimentally validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable explainable AI for sequential decision making by leveraging the strengths of formal reasoning and large language models; use Hitori as a tractable domain to test the integration of symbolic solvers with LLMs.

Method: Hybrid architecture that uses SAT/decision procedures to handle local constraints and LLMs to produce or critique visual explanations for connectivity; implement a user-facing tool that assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles and generate explanations for the solutions; provide experimental evaluation of the approach.

Result: The developed tool assists users in solving Hitori puzzles and generates explanations for its steps; experimental results support the effectiveness of the neurosymbolic approach.

Conclusion: Neurosymbolic integration of formal reasoning and LLM-based explanations is effective for complex decision sequences; Hitori serves as a strong testbed for validating flexible combinations of symbolic solvers and language models, with potential applicability to broader domains.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

*Beinuo Yang,Qishen Zhou,Junyi Li,Xingchen Su,Simon Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORThought, paired with a new LogiOR benchmark and systematic data improvements, significantly enhances LLM-based optimization modeling, especially for complex problems, by applying chain-of-thought reasoning and optimization principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome major limitations in current LLM-based optimization modeling: high annotation labeling errors, narrow evaluation scope (focusing only on optima), and heavy computational demands due to multi-agent systems and fine-tuning. This work aims to improve data quality, provide a richer, domain-specific benchmark, and a reasoning-driven modeling framework.

Method: 1) Systematic error correction and richer annotations to improve dataset quality. 2) Introduction of LogiOR, a logistics-domain optimization benchmark with more complex problems and standardized annotations. 3) ORThought framework that encodes expert-level optimization modeling principles via chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with pronounced advantages on complex optimization problems.

Conclusion: Correcting data, providing a challenging benchmark, and applying reasoning-based modeling (ORThought) enables robust, scalable LLM-powered optimization modeling, and yields actionable insights into success factors and failure modes for future research.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

### [197] [The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)
*Qiang Zhang,Pei Yan,Yijia Xu,Chuanpo Fu,Yong Fang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 6-stage Network Behavior Lifecycle, plus the A4A paradigm and HABD model, compare human vs. agent behavior across 5 dimensions to address trust, ethics, and security in networked systems, validated with red-team/blue-team cases; offers a governance-oriented path for secure human–agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly mimic human behavior in networked settings, traditional oversight struggles with trust, accountability, ethics, and security. The risk of data contamination and unclear accountability motivates a formal framework to supervise and govern human–agent interactions.

Method: Introduce the Network Behavior Lifecycle (6 stages) to dissect human vs. agent behavior at each stage; define Agent for Agent (A4A) paradigm; formulate Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD) across 5 dimensions (decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, irrational patterns); validate the approach through real-world cases like red-team penetration and blue-team defense to illustrate distinctions and governance insights.

Result: The framework provides a structured lens to distinguish human vs. agent behaviors and demonstrates practical applicability through security-oriented case studies, supporting the feasibility of quantifying disparity and guiding governance.

Conclusion: The work lays a theoretical foundation and roadmap for secure, trustworthy human–agent collaboration, and outlines future directions in dynamic cognitive governance, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

### [198] [Who Sees What? Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564)
*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured planning-derived examples provide modest gains for perspective-taking in LLM agents but are not sufficient for robust social reasoning; explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance perspective-taking and collaborative reasoning in LLM-driven agents, this study uses solution graphs from a Fast Downward planner to generate structured examples and tests them within a ReAct framework.

Method: Generate three categories of examples from the planner's solution graphs: G-type (optimal goal paths), E-type (informative node paths), and L-type (step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting actions). Transform these into thought-action prompts with explicit reasoning about each decision.

Result: L-type prompts slightly reduce clarification requests and total action steps but do not produce consistent performance gains. Agents perform well on basic attentional filtering but struggle with mentalising occluded spaces and weighing costs of epistemic actions.

Conclusion: Structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking; achieving socially grounded collaboration likely requires explicit belief tracking, cost modeling, and richer environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

*Chendong Song,Zihan Wang,Frederick Pu,Haiming Wang,Xiaohan Lin,Junqi Liu,Jia Li,Zhengying Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanGeo is a unified formal system in Lean 4 for formalizing and solving competition-level geometry problems, with a comprehensive geometry-theorem library interoperable with Mathlib, plus LeanGeo-Bench benchmark (including IMO problems). It also assesses the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a unified, formally verifiable framework for geometry that can interoperate with other mathematical domains and support rigorous proof verification, addressing the reliance on informal diagrams in geometric proofs and the difficulty of integrating geometry with other math libraries.

Method: Develop LeanGeo as a Lean 4-based formal system containing a large library of high-level geometric theorems, tightly integrated with Mathlib, and pair it with LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry benchmark drawn from IMO and other advanced sources. Evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmark to assess automated geometric reasoning capabilities.

Result: LeanGeo provides rigorous proof verification within Lean 4 and demonstrates the current limits of large language models on formal geometry tasks, highlighting gaps in automated geometric reasoning. The benchmark and library are open-sourced for community use and development.

Conclusion: LeanGeo represents a meaningful step toward a unified, verifiable framework for geometry reasoning and benchmarking. It enables seamless integration with existing math libraries and offers a resource for driving progress in automated geometric reasoning through open-source tooling.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

*Peilin Ji,Xiao Xue,Simeng Wang,Wenhao Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hierarchical multi-agent LLM framework (H-J) for urban flood response that unifies perception, optimization, and coordination to improve traffic and task success under extreme rainfall; outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme urban rainfall causes traffic congestion and disruption; decision-making is hindered by competing goals, dynamic conditions, and instability of LLM-generated strategies; existing methods don't integrate perception, optimization, and multi-agent coordination in a unified framework.

Method: Proposes H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent system with knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization, forming a closed-loop pipeline from perception to execution and refinement. Evaluated on real urban topology and rainfall data under extreme, intermittent, and light rain.

Result: H-J outperforms rule-based and RL baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness across scenarios.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches can enhance resilience in urban flood response; the framework demonstrates promise for real-world deployment and emphasizes alignment of perception, optimization, and coordination in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-Universe: a comprehensive, interaction-based benchmark for evaluating LLMs with real MCP servers across six domains and eleven servers, revealing current SOTA models' limitations and providing an open-source evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real-world MCP challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and unfamiliar tool spaces; a realistic benchmark is needed to drive model improvements within the MCP ecosystem.

Method: 6 core domains spanning 11 MCP servers (Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, Web Searching). Evaluation uses execution-based evaluators: format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Assesses leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Grok-4, Claude-4.0-Sonnet) and highlights long-context and unknown-tools challenges. Open-sourced, extensible framework with UI support for integrating new agents and MCP servers.

Result: GPT-5 achieves 43.72%, Grok-4 33.33%, Claude-4.0-Sonnet 29.44%, indicating significant performance gaps. Enterprise agents like Cursor do not outperform standard ReAct baselines. The benchmark exposes long-context burdens and unknown-tools difficulties, underscoring limitations even among top models.

Conclusion: MCP-Universe fills a critical evaluation gap for MCP-enabled LLMs, enabling robust, real-world testing and fostering innovation through an open-source framework with UI support for extending agents and MCP servers.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

*Swantje Plambeck,Ali Salamati,Eyke Huellermeier,Goerschwin Fey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven PAC-learning method estimates a CPS's safety probability on a finite horizon for systems modeled as Mealy machines, using active learning to gather data and providing probabilistic guarantees, demonstrated on automated lane-keeping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPS verification and diagnosis require powerful models, but suitable models are often unavailable or hard to extract manually. Mapping CPS behavior to discrete logic with probabilistic reachability and providing confidence-enhanced safety measures is valuable for verification tasks.

Method: Model the CPS with a discrete Mealy machine. Use Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning to estimate safety probability over n steps. Adopt an active learning loop that guides the sampling of new data after an initial dataset is collected to improve the estimate and confidence.

Result: The approach is validated through a case study on an automated lane-keeping system, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of PAC-based probabilistic safety assessment for CPS.

Conclusion: The work links discrete logic with probabilistic reachability to yield data-driven safety analysis with PAC guarantees, and shows that active learning can make data collection more efficient for CPS verification and debugging.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a thicker, reliability-based definition of AI introspection and finds that LLMs only appear to introspect under a lightweight criterion, not under the proposed robust standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus on what counts as introspection in AI. The paper argues that existing lightweight notions are insufficient and introduces a more robust, reliability-based criterion.

Method: Define a thicker introspection criterion: information about internal states must be obtained through a process more reliable than what a third party could achieve at equal or lower computational cost. Conduct experiments with LLMs reasoning about their own temperature parameters to assess whether they truly introspect under the new standard.

Result: LLMs can simulate superficial or lightweight introspection but fail to provide meaningful introspection under the thicker, reliability-based definition.

Conclusion: A thicker definition clarifies what counts as genuine introspection in AI; many prior claims of introspection may be illusory, and evaluation should focus on reliability and cost-disadvantaged access to internal state information.

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.
