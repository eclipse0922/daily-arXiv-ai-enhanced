However, designing heterogeneous\nmetamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and\nstrict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional\nconcurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization\nproblem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell\nboundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures\nfrom a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require\nadditional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we\npropose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a\ncontinuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly\naddressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural\nrepresentation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and\nlocal (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that\nrepresents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across\nthe domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility\nloss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.\nOnce trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high\nresolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical\nmetamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems\nwith potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.", "AI": {"tldr": "A neural-network based multiscale metamaterial design framework learns a continuous two-scale representation to generate compatible heterogeneous unit cells with infinite upsampling, eliminating predefined datasets and improving boundary connectivity.", "motivation": "Designing heterogeneous metamaterials is hard due to an enormous design space and strict compatibility between neighboring unit cells; traditional per-cell optimization is expensive and often yields discontinuities; fixed-library data-driven approaches are limited by datasets and require post-processing for seamlessness.", "method": "A multiscale neural representation takes both macroscale and microscale coordinates as inputs and outputs an implicit field that encodes multiscale structures with compatible unit cells; training includes a compatibility loss to enforce connectivity; no predefined dataset is required; enables designs at arbitrarily high resolutions for fabrication and simulation.", "result": "Demonstrated on mechanical metamaterial design problems including negative Poisson\u2019s ratio and mechanical cloaking, with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.", "conclusion": "The framework jointly addresses design-space coverage and boundary compatibility by learning a continuous multiscale representation, enabling seamless, high-resolution metamaterial designs without a fixed library and with infinite upsampling capabilities."}}

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space.
