Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a\nkey advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade\nwhen increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show\nBoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces Best-of-Majority (BoM), a new inference strategy that fuses majority voting and Best-of-N (BoN) for LLM prompts under Pass@k; BoM restricts candidates to high-frequency responses in N samples and selects top-k, achieving minimax-optimal regret with N \u2265 ~\u03a9(C*). It outperforms MV and BoN on math problems and remains robust as N grows.", "motivation": "Existing inference strategies (majority voting, Best-of-N) do not scale well with the sampling budget N or the decision horizon k in Pass@k settings. There is a need for an inference rule that combines their strengths and maintains performance when increasing resources.", "method": "Propose BoM with a pivotal step: filter the N sampled responses to those with high frequency, then choose the top-k rewards from this restricted set. The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing regret O(\u03b5_opt + sqrt(\u03b5_RM^2 C*/k)) when N = \u00d5(C*), and prove a matching lower bound, establishing minimax optimality. They also provide experiments on math problems comparing BoM to MV and BoN.", "result": "BoM achieves minimax-optimal regret in Pass@k inference with a sampling budget N on the order of C*.

Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "45 pages, 9 figures, published at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning\n(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent\nempirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages\navailability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a\nsimulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to\ndisentangle the task of \"learning to see\" from \"learning to act\". While expert\ndistillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state\ninformation, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through\na simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and\ncontrolled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we\ninvestigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation\nand standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The\ntrade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as\ntheoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief\ncontraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is\nnot always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new\nguidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially\nadvancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially\nobservable domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates when privileged expert distillation helps RL under partial observability, showing that benefits depend on latent dynamics stochasticity and that the best latent policy for acting is not always the best to distill; it proposes guidelines for using privileged information to improve sample efficiency in POMDPs.", "motivation": "Partial observability makes learning policies difficult; privileged information (latent states) can separate perception from action, enabling faster, more stable learning. However, distillation from privileged signals has failure modes; understanding when and how to use it can improve policy learning.", "method": "Theoretical analysis using a simple perturbed Block MDP model to capture latent dynamics, plus controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks. The study contrasts approximate decodability with belief contraction to explain when privileged distillation helps, and investigates whether the optimal latent policy is the best to distill.", "result": "Findings show that the trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL depends on the stochasticity of latent dynamics, aligned with the theoretical notions of decodability vs belief contraction. Additionally, the latent policy that is optimal for acting is not necessarily the best to distill. These results yield practical guidelines for exploiting privileged information to improve policy learning in partially observable domains.", "conclusion": "Privileged information can improve data efficiency and learning performance in POMDPs, but its effectiveness is conditioned on latent dynamics, and naive distillation of the truly optimal latent policy may be suboptimal. The work calls for principled guidelines to leverage privileged states in real-world RL tasks."}}

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.
