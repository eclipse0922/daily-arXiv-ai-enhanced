### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline (HandMDM) to train a text-conditioned 3D hand-motion diffusion model from sign-language video data, using LLM-generated, attribute-based text labels; demonstrates cross-domain generalization and will release data/models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable high-level natural-language control of 3D hand motions and signs at scale by leveraging large unlabeled video data and automated pseudo-labels; address cross-language generalization and data scarcity.

Method: Construct a large paired dataset by translating noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories from sign-language video into hand-motion descriptions via an LLM using a dictionary of sign attributes and motion-script cues; train a text-conditioned diffusion model HandMDM; evaluate cross-domain generalization across unseen categories within the same sign language, across another sign language, and non-sign hand movements.

Result: HandMDM demonstrates robustness across domains; extensive experimental evaluation supports cross-language and cross-domain generalization; plans to release models and data publicly.

Conclusion: This work advances scalable text-to-3D hand-motion generation and supports future research in sign-language AI by providing data, models, and a demonstration of cross-domain capabilities.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR translates video into compact visual event sequences for LVLM-based action recognition, using a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) and a frozen LLaVA-1.5 adapted with Prompt Tuning v2 to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term action recognition in real-world videos is hampered by cluttered backgrounds, subtle action differences, high computational costs, and limited long-range temporal modeling. While LVLMs offer strong multi-modal reasoning, applying them directly to continuous video streams for fine-grained actions remains unresolved.

Method: Propose VT-LVLM-AR with a Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that builds compact, semantically rich, temporally coherent visual event sequences via lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These sequences are fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module using a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted with parameter-efficient Prompt Tuning v2 for action classification.

Result: On NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, VT-LVLM-AR achieves state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the critical role of VTEM components and prompting, and human evaluations show interpretability of the visual event representations.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust, interpretable video action understanding via effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT introduces a vision-language pathology framework that converts whole-slide image (WSI) level supervision into tile-level guidance using spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning. It outperforms MIL-based methods on rare cancers and improves cancer localization, offering a scalable aid for subtyping with limited expert access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare cancers suffer from diagnostic bottlenecks due to scarce expert availability, especially in pediatrics. While vision-language (VL) foundation models show zero-shot potential for common subtypes, their performance on rare cancers is limited. Traditional multi-instance learning (MIL) relies only on visual features and lacks cross-modal interpretability, which is critical for diagnosing rare cancers.

Method: PathPT leverages spatially-aware visual aggregation and prompt tuning to exploit VL pathology foundation models. It converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging zero-shot capabilities of VL models, enabling localization of cancerous regions and cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics. Evaluation spans eight rare-cancer datasets (four adult, four pediatric) across 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, plus three common-cancer datasets, testing four VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings.

Result: PathPT consistently yields superior performance, with substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous-region grounding compared with existing methods across both rare and common cancer benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers by providing a scalable solution that improves subtyping accuracy and localization, facilitating cross-modal reasoning in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

### [4] [Semantic-Aware Ship Detection with Vision-Language Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15930)
*Jiahao Li,Jiancheng Pan,Yuze Sun,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision-Language Model–based ship detector with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window, augmented by a new ShipSem-VL dataset for fine-grained ship attributes, evaluated on three tasks to demonstrate comprehensive semantic-aware ship detection (SASD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote-sensing ship detectors struggle to capture fine-grained semantic cues in complex scenes, hindering accurate, semantic-rich detection. A Vision-Language framework + adaptive multi-scale window can integrate appearance and textual semantics, while a dedicated ShipSem-VL dataset enables fine-grained attribute learning.

Method: Integrates Vision-Language Models with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window strategy to form SASD. Introduces ShipSem-VL dataset for semantic attributes of ships. Evaluates on three tasks to assess performance from multiple perspectives.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across three tasks, with comprehensive analyses indicating improved semantic awareness and robustness over baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed SASD framework advances semantic-aware ship detection in remote sensing by leveraging VLMs, adaptive multi-scale processing, and a specialized dataset, with multi-task evaluation supporting its broadened applicability.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

### [5] [Automatic Retrieval of Specific Cows from Unlabeled Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15945)
*Jiawen Lyu,Manu Ramesh,Madison Simonds,Jacquelyn P. Boerman,Amy R. Reibman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-component system for hands-free cow cataloging and identification from video, using a non-deep-learning eidetic recognizer and a streaming-ID module, demonstrated on unlabeled cow footage in a milking-parlor setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate individual-level tracking of dairy cows to improve herd management, reduce manual tagging, and enable scalable monitoring in real-world videos where cows move unscripted through holding areas.

Method: AutoCataloger builds a per-cow catalog from a single input video clip per cow; an eidetic cow recognizer performs identification without deep learning; CowFinder identifies cows in continuous video streams, enabling retrieval of individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented footage.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the system can locate and identify individual cows in unlabeled, unsegmented video of cows walking through a holding area, suggesting practical value for hands-free herd monitoring.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a practical, non-deep-learning pipeline for cow cataloging and identification in real-world video, showing promise for automated herd management, though details on performance, generalization, and scalability are needed.

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

### [6] [Investigating Different Geo Priors for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15946)
*Angela Zhu,Christian Lange,Max Hamilton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates Spatial Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) as geographic priors for iNaturalist image-based species classification, examining model configurations and handling of unseen species to identify factors affecting prior effectiveness beyond range maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage species distribution models to improve vision-based species classification when location data is available, and to understand how SINR priors behave in practice.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple SINR model configurations on iNaturalist observations; experiments addressing predictions for species not included in Geo Prior training; comparison of factors influencing Geo Prior effectiveness.

Result: Identified factors contributing to the effectiveness of SINR Geo Priors; some factors differ from those governing accurate range maps; performance depends on configuration and unseen-species handling.

Conclusion: SINR-based geo priors are promising for vision tasks but require careful design and handling of unseen species; they capture spatial patterns beyond simple range maps.

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised Transformer model, Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC), uses adaptive superpixel layers to replace fixed grid patches, addressing grid-structure limitations in Vision Transformers and improving performance on standard image benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers rely on fixed-size, non-adaptive patches and grid-based assumptions, which limit adaptation to varying image content and cross-modality applicability. ASC aims to overcome these limitations by enabling content-aware, adaptive partitioning.

Method: Propose ASC, a self-supervised Transformer-based model that employs adaptive superpixel layers which dynamically adjust to image content; include analysis of key properties that contribute to its effectiveness.

Result: ASC outperforms widely-used baselines on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive superpixel coding provides content-aware, adaptive patching that improves performance and reduces dependence on rigid grid structures in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

### [8] [Glo-VLMs: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerulus Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15960)
*Zhenhao Guo,Rachit Saluja,Tianyuan Yao,Quan Liu,Yuankai Huo,Benjamin Liechty,David J. Pisapia,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Glo-VLMs adapt large pretrained vision-language models for fine-grained glomerular classification in data-scarce settings, showing competitive metrics with 8-shot per class, and offering a systematic comparison of architectures and adaptation strategies using curated pathology images and clinical text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtle morphological differences among glomerular subtypes and the mismatch between visual patterns and clinical terminology make automated renal pathology diagnosis challenging. Large pretrained VLMs may help, but require careful adaptation and fair evaluation in few-shot regimes.

Method: Introduce Glo-VLMs, a framework for adapting VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in data-constrained settings. The approach uses curated pathology images with clinical text prompts to learn joint image-text representations, evaluates multiple VLM architectures and adaptation strategies under few-shot learning, and adopts standardized multi-class evaluation for fair comparisons.

Result: Fine-tuning the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with 8 shots per class.

Conclusion: Foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained medical image classification under limited supervision, highlighting the practical potential of large pretrained models for specialized clinical research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

*Floris Erich,Naoya Chiba,Abdullah Mustafa,Ryo Hanai,Noriaki Ando,Yusuke Yoshiyasu,Yukiyasu Domae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated reconstruction of complete 3D object meshes from multiple videos using known points (from fiducials) and Structure-from-Motion, merging results to avoid hole filling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable inexpensive, automatic generation of complete geometric models of everyday objects without dedicated 3D scanners.

Method: Provide one known point per video frame via fiducials (checkerboard/AR markers); register remaining frames in world space with Structure-from-Motion; merge multiple videos to produce a complete object mesh without hole filling.

Result: A system that can generate a complete object mesh from several videos; code is released (GitHub).

Conclusion: Multi-video SfM with known-point initialization enables complete meshing of objects without relying on hole filling, broadening accessibility of 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from
https://github.com/FlorisE/NeuralMeshing.

### [10] [Contributions to Label-Efficient Learning in Computer Vision and Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15973)
*Minh-Tan Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey-style manuscript proposing four axis approaches for label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing, including weakly supervised object discovery with anomaly-aware representations, multi-task learning across disjoint datasets, multimodal self-supervised/contrastive learning for scene classification, and few-shot hierarchical scene classification, supported by extensive experiments and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expensive pixel-level annotations in CV and Earth observation, leveraging unlabeled data, cross-dataset transfer, multi-modality, and hierarchical modeling to improve detection, segmentation, and classification under limited labeled data.

Method: 1) Weakly supervised object discovery/detection via anomaly-aware representations learned from large background image collections. 2) Multi-task learning across datasets with disjoint annotations to boost object detection and semantic segmentation. 3) Self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning using multimodal data to enhance remote-sensing scene classification. 4) Few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification with explicit and implicit hierarchy modeling.

Result: Extensive experimental results across natural and remote-sensing datasets indicate the proposed label-efficient methods are effective, showing improved data efficiency and generalization across domains; results are framed within collaborative research efforts.

Conclusion: Ongoing and future research directions focus on scaling and further enhancing label-efficient learning for real-world, multi-domain applications.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

### [11] [Panoptic Segmentation of Environmental UAV Images : Litter Beach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15985)
*Ousmane Youme,Jean Marie Dembélé,Eugene C. Ezin,Christophe Cambier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation are applied to UAV imagery for marine litter detection. The approach addresses sand heterogeneity and achieves good accuracy with very small labeled datasets, showing robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine litter is a global environmental challenge. UAVs offer high-resolution, local-area imagery but heterogeneous beach sand (color reflections, footprints, shadows, algae, dunes, holes, tire tracks) causes false inferences for basic CNNs. The work explores segmentation methods that can perform well with limited labeled data.

Method: The authors employ an instance-based segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method designed to work with small sample sizes. Applied to UAV images of beaches to detect marine litter with robustness to sandy background variability.

Result: Both segmentation approaches yield good accuracy with only a few labeled samples, indicating improved robustness to sand-related visual noise compared to basic CNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed segmentation-based approach is more robust and less data-hungry for marine litter detection in heterogeneous sandy environments, making it suitable for rapid deployment with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

### [12] [HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465)
*Anilkumar Swamy,Vincent Leroy,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Jean-Sébastien Franco,Grégory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOSt3R introduces a detector-free monocular method for hand-object 3D transformation and 3D shape reconstruction, enabling object-agnostic, template-free hand-object recovery from RGB sequences and multi-view integration, achieving state-of-the-art on SHOWMe and generalizing to unseen objects on HO3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Keypoint-based pipelines (SfM and hand-keypoint optimization) struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual occlusions, hindering scalability and generalization; a non-intrusive, generic solution is needed.

Method: Proposes HOSt3R, a robust detector-free approach to estimate hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images, integrated with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to recover hand-object 3D shape; does not rely on pre-scanned templates or camera intrinsics; evaluated on SHOWMe and HO3D.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on SHOWMe; demonstrates generalization to unseen object categories on HO3D.

Conclusion: This work enables generic, non-intrusive hand-object reconstruction, improving scalability and generalization for HCI/AR/VR applications; it broadens applicability beyond template-based or intrinsics-dependent methods.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

*Jerry Cao-Xue,Tien Comlekoglu,Keyi Xue,Guanliang Wang,Jiang Li,Gordon Laurie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic retinal fundus data (SynFundus-1M) can train robust multi-label disease classifiers that generalize well to real clinical images, using six architectures and an ensemble approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome scarcity and privacy costs of large annotated retinal datasets by leveraging a high-fidelity synthetic resource to establish baselines and benchmarks for model performance.

Method: Train six modern architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound) on 11-disease multi-label classification using a 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation, and build a meta-ensemble by stacking out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost classifier.

Result: Internal validation macro-AUC of 0.9973; cross-dataset generalization: DR dataset AUC 0.7972, AIROGS glaucoma dataset AUC 0.9126, RFMiD macro-AUC 0.8800.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust baseline for large-scale synthetic datasets and demonstrates that synthetic-data-trained models can accurately classify multiple retinal pathologies and generalize to real images, supporting scalable AI development in ophthalmology.

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Motivation: Sign Language Production (SLP) must capture diversity in appearance, facial expressions, and hand movements, but current models struggle to preserve linguistic content while modeling non-manual attributes and diversity.

Method: Employ Latent Diffusion Models to generate photorealistic avatars from a generated reference image. Introduce a sign feature aggregation module that explicitly models non-manual and manual features (face and hands) to preserve linguistic content while enabling diversity through reference images with varying ethnic backgrounds.

Result: On YouTube-SL-25, the pipeline yields superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art methods and shows significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed LDM-based approach with a sign feature aggregation module preserves linguistic content while enhancing diversity and visual fidelity in sign-language production, demonstrated on a standard dataset.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

*Aykut Sirma,Angelos Plastropoulos,Argyrios Zolotas,Gilbert Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: High-res 1080p aerial dataset DRespNeT for post-earthquake instance segmentation with 28 classes; demonstrates real-time SAR-ready performance using a YOLOv8-DRN model achieving 92.7% mAP50 at 27 FPS on RTX-4090.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for rapid, fine-grained situational awareness in earthquake zones to identify accessible entry points and obstacles for SAR operations; existing datasets rely on satellite imagery or coarse labels, hindering planning and human-robot collaboration.

Method: Create DRespNeT with polygon-level instance segmentation annotations from 1080p aerial footage in disaster zones (e.g., 2023 Türkiye earthquake). 28 classes including buildings, doors/windows, gaps, debris, personnel, vehicles, civilians. Evaluate with YOLOv8-seg; propose optimized YOLOv8-DRN achieving real-time multi-target detection.

Result: Achieves 92.7% mAP50 with 27 FPS inference on RTX-4090 for multi-target detection, indicating real-time situational awareness; dataset and models aim to support SAR teams and robotic systems.

Conclusion: DRespNeT fills a gap for high-resolution, fine-grained, polygon-level annotations tailored to post-disaster SAR. Enables improved human-robot collaboration, faster decision-making, and potentially better survivor outcomes; provides a foundation for operational planning and response efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

*Jinyue Song,Hansol Ku,Jayneel Vora,Nelson Lee,Ahmad Kamari,Prasant Mohapatra,Parth Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoVeRaP introduces a 21k-frame multi-vehicle FMCW-radar dataset and a cooperative perception framework with middle/late fusion; middle fusion with intensity encoding yields large gains (up to 9x mAP at IoU 0.9); dataset and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar-based 3D perception is robust in rain/glare but produces sparse/noisy point clouds; leveraging cooperative sensing across vehicles and sensor modalities can improve detection robustness.

Method: Proposes a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle and late fusion. A baseline network uses a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity cues into a shared latent space, followed by a decoder that outputs 3D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence. The dataset aligns radar, camera, and GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse maneuvers.

Result: Middle fusion with intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines.

Conclusion: First reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception; affordable radar sharing significantly improves detection robustness; dataset and code are publicly available to spur further research.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [17] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM enhances PaDiM by applying 2D DWT to multi-layer CNN features, selecting frequency subbands, aligning and concatenating them, and modeling with PaDiM's Gaussian framework, achieving strong anomaly detection/localization on MVTec AD with backbones like ResNet-18 and EfficientNet; wavelet choice trades off localization versus image-level detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random channel selection in PaDiM risks discarding structured, frequency-dependent information. By using wavelet transforms to capture multi-scale frequency content, WE-PaDiM aims to improve localization and interpretability while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Compute 2D DWT on feature maps from multiple backbone layers, select specific frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL, HH), spatially align, and concatenate channel-wise. Then model normal features with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian. Evaluate on MVTec AD across various backbones (ResNet-18, EfficientNet B0-B6).

Result: Reported average Image-AUC 99.32% and Pixel-AUC 92.10% across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Wavelet choice affects performance: Haar and including detail subbands tends to improve localization, while LL subbands improve image-level detection.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM provides a competitive, more interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, with robust anomaly detection/localization and similar efficiency; promising for industrial inspection. Caveats include sensitivity to wavelet choice and potential computational overhead.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

### [18] [Expandable Residual Approximation for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16050)
*Zhaoyi Yan,Binghui Chen,Yunfan Liu,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERA introduces Expandable Residual Approximation for knowledge distillation, using a Multi-Branched Residual Network to progressively approximate residual knowledge and a Teacher Weight Integration strategy to mitigate teacher-student capacity gaps, yielding consistent gains on ImageNet and COCO and strong cross-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets the persistent teacher–student capacity gap in knowledge distillation, where standard KD struggles to transfer high-level representations from a powerful teacher to a lighter student. It seeks to make the distillation process easier by decomposing the residual learning task into smaller steps and by leveraging the teacher's head weights.

Method: Propose ERA, which decomposes residual knowledge approximation into multiple steps via a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet). Introduce Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) to reuse the teacher's head weights, mitigating capacity disparity between teacher and student.

Result: Empirical results show +1.41% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and +1.40 AP on MS COCO object detection, with ERA achieving leading performance across CV tasks. Code and models are released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: ERA effectively reduces the teacher–student gap in KD by a progressive, branch-based residual approximation and weight re-use strategy, yielding consistent improvements across classification and detection benchmarks and enabling broader CV applicability.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

### [19] [Advances and Trends in the 3D Reconstruction of the Shape and Motion of Animals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16062)
*Ziqi Li,Abderraouf Amrani,Shri Rai,Hamid Laga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey of recent deep learning approaches for non-intrusive 3D reconstruction of animal shape, pose, and motion from RGB data, organizing methods by input modality, geometric representation, reconstruction technique, and training strategy, and outlining strengths, limitations, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D geometry and motion of animals enables applications in biology, livestock management, conservation and welfare, as well as digital content creation for VR/AR; traditional 3D scanners are intrusive, costly, and impractical in natural animal environments, prompting a shift to non-intrusive deep learning methods.

Method: The paper categorizes state-of-the-art methods by input modalities (RGB images/videos), representations of 3D geometry and motion (meshes, point clouds, implicit representations), reconstruction techniques (model-based vs. data-driven, optimization vs. learning-based), and training mechanisms (supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised). It also analyzes performance, strengths/limitations, and discusses challenges and future directions.

Result: The survey synthesizes contemporary progress and identifies ongoing challenges (e.g., occlusions, variability across species, data scarcity, domain shift, and real-time requirements). It provides a consolidated overview and benchmarks existing approaches across modalities and representations, highlighting what works well and where gaps remain.

Conclusion: Future research directions include integrating multimodal inputs, expanding and diversifying datasets, developing standardized benchmarks, creating robust representations for non-rigid animal bodies, enabling transfer learning across species, and bridging the gap to real-world, field deployment.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

### [20] [A Unified Voxel Diffusion Module for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16069)
*Qifeng Liu,Dawei Zhao,Yabo Dong,Linzhi Shang,Liang Xiao,Juan Wang,Kunkong Zhao,Dongming Lu,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDM boosts voxel-level features for point-cloud detectors by diffusing salient voxel information via sparse 3D convolutions, with downsampling for efficiency, enabling strong integration with Transformer/SSM models and achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-based representations in point-cloud detectors face strict input/output dimension constraints and limited spatial diffusion, which hampers spatial context and accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based detection, the paper proposes a diffusion-enhanced voxel module to enrich voxel features and diffusion.

Method: Introduce Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) comprising sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections; output downsampled to 1/4 input resolution for efficiency; two roles: (1) diffuse foreground voxel features to enrich spatial context, (2) aggregate fine-grained spatial information to strengthen voxel representations; can be embedded into Transformer- or SSM-based detectors to improve classification and localization.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements over baselines across datasets; VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

Conclusion: VDM generalizes across different detector architectures (Transformer- and SSM-based) and datasets, yielding higher detection accuracy; code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ELF: a five-model ensemble that creates unified slide-level representations from 53,699 WSIs across 20 sites, surpassing individual models and existing slide-level approaches in disease classification, biomarker detection, and therapy-response prediction across multiple cancers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology foundation models are trained on heterogeneous datasets with diverse strategies, causing inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. There is a need for a unified, data-efficient slide-level representation that leverages complementary information from multiple models to improve robustness and clinical utility.

Method: ELF integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate a single, unified slide-level representation via ensemble learning. Trained on a large, multi-site WSI dataset (53,699 slides across 20 anatomical sites), the slide-level architecture is designed for data-limited clinical contexts and broad applicability across disease classification, biomarker detection, and therapy-response prediction.

Result: ELF consistently outperforms all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models in diverse tasks (disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy) across multiple cancer types, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness and improved data efficiency.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning across pathology foundation models yields a scalable, generalizable solution for AI-assisted precision oncology. ELF demonstrates the practical viability of unified slide-level representations for broad clinical use and therapy-guided decision making.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

TL;DR: Proposes MSPG-SEN, a two-flow feedback, multi-scale progressive GAN with APFL, a global two-flow dynamic residual network, and a dynamic embedded attention mechanism (DEMA) to boost image quality, robustness, and training efficiency, claiming state-of-the-art results on five datasets; however, the abstract is noisy and some dataset names/numbers appear garbled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass GAN limitations by leveraging a two-flow feedback and multi-scale progressive generation while improving training stability and efficiency, inspired by diffusion model progress and GAN variants. The goal is higher image quality, robustness, and generalization with lower training cost.

Method: Introduce MSPG-SEN: a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive GAN. Key components: adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL) for robustness and stability; globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network to improve training efficiency and generalization; dynamic embedded attention mechanism (DEMA) to capture global-local information with low compute. Ablation studies to assess contributions; experiments claimed across five datasets.

Result: Claims state-of-the-art generation results on five datasets with reported scores: INKK 89.7, AWUN 78.3, IONJ 85.5, POKL 88.7, OPIN 96.4. Also reports improved robustness, training stability, and reduced training cost; DEMA enables cross-task applicability and efficient global-local feature representation.

Conclusion: The proposed MSPG-SEN framework purportedly improves image quality, robustness, stability, and efficiency in GAN-based generation, with strong cross-task capabilities via DEMA; however, several textual inconsistencies (dataset names, metrics) warrant careful verification and replication.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so
on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five
datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset
is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAFR2: a simple unsupervised domain adaptation framework that refines BN statistics on target data, distills features from a source model, and transfers hypotheses to align distributions; yields robust, domain-invariant features and state-of-the-art corruption robustness across CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C, PatchCamelyon-C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift with unlabeled target data requires robust adaptation without labels or complex training. The goal is to align feature distributions at statistical and representational levels to generalize across similar domains.

Method: Three components: (1) adapt Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data, (2) feature distillation from a source-trained model, (3) hypothesis transfer. The framework emphasizes unsupervised alignment of feature distributions at both statistical and representational levels, without requiring target labels or complex training objectives.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in robustness to corruption on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C, and PatchCamelyon-C. Theoretical and empirical analyses indicate improved feature alignment, increased mutual information between domains, and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Conclusion: DAFR2 is a simple yet effective unsupervised domain adaptation approach that yields domain-invariant features and better generalization across similar domains without relying on target labels or heavy training objectives.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

TL;DR: An integrated 4D CBCT platform for low-dose, dynamic joint imaging using dual-robotic-arm upright CBCT, a 3D-2D fusion pipeline, and a kinematic assessment framework; shows sub-voxel accuracy and strong clinical validation for knee arthroplasty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CT cannot capture dynamic, weight-bearing joint motion; there is a need for four-dimensional imaging to assess function after surgery, but existing approaches are limited by high radiation or incomplete spatial information.

Method: (1) A dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) with a programmable, upright-compatible gantry-free trajectory; (2) a hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using deep learning preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative optimization; (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative kinematic assessment.

Result: In simulations, achieved sub-voxel accuracy of 0.235 mm with 99.18% success rate, outperforming conventional and state-of-the-art registration methods. Clinically, accurately quantified tibial plateau motion and medial-lateral variance in post-TKA patients.

Conclusion: The 4D CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging, creating new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to model spatial correlations and cannot end-to-end fuse inter-cell and intra-discriminative features, risking loss of critical diagnostic cues.

Method: Propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network. Use Multi-level Fusion Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extraction; apply Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation module (CLFFS-HC) to integrate mixed features for end-to-end detection.

Result: Experiments on three publicly available datasets show significant improvement in cervical abnormal cell detection performance.

Conclusion: Hypergraph-based fusion effectively combines spatial and discriminative features, enabling stronger end-to-end detection of abnormal cervical cells in TCT images.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

### [26] [Beyond Human-prompting: Adaptive Prompt Tuning with Semantic Alignment for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16157)
*Pi-Wei Chen,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin,Wei-Han Chen,Jia Ji,Zih-Ching Chen,Feng-Hao Yeh,Chao-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Prompt Tuning (APT) with semantic alignment enables knowledge-free, few-shot anomaly detection using self-generated noisy anomalies and a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS); achieves state-of-the-art results without handcrafted prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prev. VLM-based anomaly detection relies on human-designed prompts and scarce anomaly samples, causing gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding. APT aims to remove these dependencies and improve generalization in few-shot settings.

Method: APT trains learnable prompts on self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations to capture context-dependent anomalies. SMGS iteratively aligns prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomalies, preventing overfitting and promoting semantic grounding.

Result: Improves pixel-wise anomaly detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting.

Conclusion: APT provides a robust, knowledge-free, few-shot framework for context-aware anomaly detection, extending VLM capabilities to practical, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

### [27] [RAGSR: Regional Attention Guided Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16158)
*Haodong He,Yancheng Bai,Rui Lan,Xu Duan,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAGSR uses region-level priors and a regional attention mechanism to guide diffusion-based super-resolution, yielding better fine-grained regional details and overall coherence in multi-object scenes compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SISR with large VLMs and T2I priors struggles to generate accurate, region-specific details in scenes with multiple objects due to coarse region descriptions and limited ability to handle complex prompts.

Method: Localize object regions, assign fine-grained region captions, and format region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I diffusion models. Employ a regional guided attention to ensure each region-text pair contributes to the corresponding region while preventing interactions between unrelated region-text pairs, enabling controlled text–image integration.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets show superior perceptual realism of details and better contextual consistency, outperforming existing approaches in handling regional details and multi-object interactions.

Conclusion: Regional attention with region-text priors effectively addresses fine-grained regional detail generation and coherence in SISR, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and enhancing SR quality in multi-object scenes.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

### [28] [Through the Looking Glass: A Dual Perspective on Weakly-Supervised Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16159)
*Jiaqi Ma,Guo-Sen Xie,Fang Zhao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TLG introduces heterogeneous, homologous networks for meta-learning to break over-semantic homogenization, using HA, HT, and HC-CLIP to enhance cross-perspective support-query features; achieves strong weakly supervised WFSS results with tiny parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In meta-learning, uniformly sampling homogeneous support-query pairs and identical architectures cause over-semantic homogenization, limiting generalization. There is a need for genuine heterogeneity and cross-modal cues to boost complementarity while preserving shared semantics.

Method: Propose heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) to boost complementarity; heterogeneous transfer (HT) to reduce semantic noise and emphasize unique heterogeneous semantics; heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to improve multimodal generalization; apply to weakly supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) with a compact model (TLG).

Result: With only 1/24 of the parameters of state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2% improvement on Pascal-5i and a 9.7% improvement on COCO-20i in WFSS. It is claimed to be the first weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised pixel-level models under the same backbone. Code is available at the provided URL.

Conclusion: Introducing heterogeneity and multimodal (CLIP-based) guidance yields strong, parameter-efficient WFSS performance, suggesting a promising direction for meta-learning architectures that balance shared semantics with heterogeneous, complementary representations.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is
available at https://github.com/jarch-ma/TLG.

### [29] [FTIO: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16183)
*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-processing framework for unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) that improves object selection by favoring frequently appearing salient objects and corrects temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing mask regions, achieving state-of-the-art results on multi-object UVOS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) faces challenges such as uncertain initial segmentation, object proposals, deformation, and fast motion which lead to temporal inconsistencies. There is a need for robust post-processing to stabilize object selection and masks across frames.

Method: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects (FTIO) comprises two parts: 1) a combined criterion to select frequently appearing salient objects, mitigating failures for small or structurally complex objects; 2) a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by integrating missing object mask regions across frames.

Result: FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FTIO effectively addresses initial segmentation uncertainty and temporal inconsistencies in UVOS, offering a robust post-processing solution with publicly available code.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

### [30] [SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201)
*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free speculative decoding framework (SpecVLM) for Vid-LLMs that uses staged video token pruning to accelerate decoding with minimal accuracy loss, achieving up to 2.68x speedups on large models and 2.11x on others without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs rely on dense video tokens, causing high memory/computation during prefilling and decoding. Existing token reduction often degrades information. A lossless, training-free acceleration during decoding is desirable.

Method: Two-stage pruning for speculative decoding: Stage I selects highly informative tokens using attention signals from the verifier (target model); Stage II prunes remaining tokens in a spatially uniform manner. The draft model's speculation is robust to token pruning, enabling pruning up to ~90% with minimal accuracy loss, without extra training.

Result: Empirical validation on four video understanding benchmarks shows significant speedups: up to 2.68x for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11x for Qwen2.5-VL-32B, with robustness across tasks.

Conclusion: SpecVLM provides a training-free, robust approach to accelerate Vid-LLMs through staged token pruning in speculative decoding, achieving substantial speedups without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

### [31] [\textsc{T-Mask}: Temporal Masking for Probing Foundation Models across Camera Views in Driver Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16207)
*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probing-based adaptation of image foundation models for cross-view driver monitoring using a new T-Mask method; achieves cross-view gains without extra parameters, outperforming PEFT, and especially improves underrepresented activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view robustness in driver monitoring is hard; foundation models offer generalization but unseen viewpoints require lightweight adaptation; explore probing vs full fine-tuning; introduce temporal focus to dynamic regions.

Method: Compare linear probes, advanced probing, DINOv2 vs CLIP, PEFT vs full fine-tuning; propose T-Mask image-to-video probing with temporal token masking; train on single view; evaluate cross-view on Drive&Act dataset.

Result: T-Mask yields +1.23% cross-view top-1 accuracy over strong probing baselines and +8.0% over PEFT; boosts underrepresented activities by +5.42% (trained view) and +1.36% (cross-view).

Conclusion: Lightweight probing with temporal token selection like T-Mask can robustly enable fine-grained driver observation in cross-view/low-data settings; code and models released.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

### [32] [Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16211)
*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate) treats feature caching in Diffusion Transformers as solving a feature-ODE, improving stability of long-step forecasting and enabling near-lossless speedups at high acceleration ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers are costly; existing caching methods degrade generation quality when skipping many timesteps due to instability in long-step forecasts. A robust way to reuse historical features at large intervals is needed.

Method: Model the hidden-feature sequence as a feature-ODE along the diffusion trajectory. Propose FoCa, which performs forecasting of features across steps and then calibrates them to correct integration errors, effectively treating caching as an ODE-solving process.

Result: Extensive experiments on image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution show FoCa is effective, especially under aggressive acceleration. Reported near-lossless speedups: 5.50x (FLUX), 6.45x (HunyuanVideo), 3.17x (Inf-DiT), and 4.53x (DiT), with preserved high-quality outputs.

Conclusion: FoCa stabilizes high-acceleration diffusion inference by robustly integrating historical features via a feature-ODE framework, delivering substantial speedups without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

### [33] [OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212)
*Huanpeng Chu,Wei Wu,Guanyu Fen,Yutao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache is a training-free caching strategy for diffusion transformers that accelerates sampling by exploiting global redundancy across the entire denoising trajectory, rather than focusing on inter-step similarities or later steps, with dynamic noise filtering during cache reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers are powerful but computationally expensive due to many sampling steps and heavy per-step computations. There is a need for real-time deployment-ready acceleration that does not require retraining.

Method: Analyze the sampling trajectories of diffusion transformers from a global perspective and strategically distribute cache reuse across the entire sampling process. During cache reuse, estimate the corresponding noise and filter it to reduce its impact on sampling direction, enabling more effective reuse of cached computations.

Result: Extensive experiments show faster sampling while maintaining competitive generative quality, demonstrating the practicality of training-free diffusion-Transformer acceleration.

Conclusion: OmniCache offers a practical, training-free solution to efficiently deploy diffusion-based generative models by leveraging global cache reuse across the sampling trajectory and noise-aware cache filtering.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

*Kaiyuan Ji,Yijin Guo,Zicheng Zhang,Xiangyang Zhu,Yuan Tian,Ning Liu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees benchmarks safety-performance trade-offs in medical LLM reasoning under manipulative hints, using 1,804 questions, 7 hint types, and 7 models. A composite 45 Degrees metric shows a persistent safety-accuracy trade-off; open-source QwQ-32B offers best balance (43.81 Degrees) but no model dominates in both facets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess not just accuracy but the faithfulness of reasoning (CoT-Faithfulness) and resistance to sycophancy under misleading cues in medical LLMs, addressing the limitation of single-accuracy benchmarks.

Method: A dataset of 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, each paired with seven manipulative hint types plus a no-hint baseline (~27K inputs). Seven LLMs (open/closed, general/medical, base/reasoning-enhanced) are evaluated, totaling ~189K inferences. Metrics: Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, Anti-Sycophancy; combined into a composite 45 Degrees plot.

Result: Finds a consistent safety-performance trade-off: no model surpasses the diagonal of the plot. QwQ-32B (open-source) is closest to the diagonal with 43.81 Degrees, balancing safety and accuracy but not excelling in both.

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees provides a focused benchmark to reveal reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guide safer development by highlighting safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative cues.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

### [35] [PromptFlare: Prompt-Generalized Defense via Cross-Attention Decoy in Diffusion-Based Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16217)
*Hohyun Na,Seunghoo Hong,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-attention-based adversarial defense named PromptFlare protects images from malicious diffusion-based inpainting by injecting adversarial noise into an invariant prompt token, acting as a cross-attention decoy to hinder prompt-image alignment; achieves state-of-the-art protection with lower compute/memory on EditBench; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models enable high-quality, user-directed image edits but can be misused. Prior defenses focus on image-level inconsistencies and often fail to address text prompt influence, limiting prevention of prompt-based manipulation.

Method: Identify a shared, invariant, semantically uninformative prompt token. Inject adversarial noise into its embeddings to create a cross-attention decoy that diverts the model's attention away from meaningful prompt-image alignment during the sampling process in diffusion-based inpainting models. Evaluate on the EditBench dataset, compare metrics and resource usage.

Result: Outperforms existing defenses across multiple metrics while reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage; demonstrates robust protection against unauthorized image manipulations. Code is available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: PromptFlare demonstrates that prompt-centric defenses are effective and efficient for mitigating prompt-based misuse of diffusion inpainting. The approach improves safety for diffusion-based image editing and suggests potential for broader applicability across models and modalities.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable, trustworthy CV systems in dynamic real-world environments and high-stakes domains by understanding robustness requirements and vulnerabilities.

Method: Literature survey of empirical defenses and robust training methods; synthesis of network properties and defense components; analysis to guide ablations and benchmarking metrics.

Result: A comprehensive analysis of defense mechanisms and their limitations; identification of key factors affecting robustness; recommendations for ablation studies and standardized benchmarking metrics.

Conclusion: Robustness in VFMs is essential for trust; progress requires careful evaluation frameworks, improved defense design, and realistic benchmarking to address distributional shifts and adversarial risk.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

*Jiahao Chen,Zhiyong Ma,Wenbiao Du,Qingyuan Chuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces FlexMUSE, a flexible MMCW framework with optional T2I input, semantic alignment gating, cross-modal fusion, and MSC-DPO, validated on ArtMUSE with promising creativity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the core MMCW challenge: generating illustrated articles where text and visuals are loosely related, requiring economical training and better semantic alignment between modalities. Existing MMG approaches either require specific inputs or incur high costs and can suffer semantic mismatch.

Method: FlexMUSE comprises a Text-to-Image (T2I) module for optional visual input, a modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to constrain textual input, an attention-based cross-modality fusion to augment input features, and a modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) that extends rejected samples to boost writing creativity. It also introduces the ArtMUSE dataset with ~3k calibrated text-image pairs.

Result: Promising results showing consistency, creativity, and coherence in the generated illustrated articles.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE advances MMCW by enabling flexible use of visuals and tighter semantic alignment across modalities; ArtMUSE provides a valuable dataset resource for future MMCW work, supporting more coherent and creative outputs.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcomes lack of large, diverse, expert-annotated EM datasets due to acquisition cost, privacy, and annotation complexity to enable deep learning-based EM characterization.

Method: Assembles UniEM-3M with 5,091 high-res EMs, ~3M instance segmentation labels, and disentangled textual descriptions; releases a text-to-image diffusion model; evaluates representative instance segmentation methods; proposes UniEM-Net as baseline; reports flow-based model performance.

Result: Flow-based model achieves superior performance on the benchmark; partial data, full generative model, and comprehensive benchmark released on HuggingFace; subset public; diffusion model useful for augmentation and distribution proxy.

Conclusion: The release will significantly accelerate progress in automated materials analysis through multimodal understanding in EM, providing data, generative tools, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

### [39] [Structuring GUI Elements through Vision Language Models: Towards Action Space Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16271)
*Yi Xu,Yesheng Zhang,jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) improves how multimodal LMs predict GUI element coordinates by augmenting training with IoU-based sampling and fine-tuning to reduce exposure bias, yielding better coordinate accuracy than standard MLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI element coordinate prediction is hampered by sparse numeric tokens in language representations and limited diverse data; improving the visual module of MLLMs for GUI understanding requires targeted data augmentation and training strategies.

Method: Introduce IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood training. Develop an IoU-based coordinate sampling pipeline that augments training data by sampling coordinates near ground-truth ones, then fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm to mitigate exposure bias in traditional MLE.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IAML yields superior coordinate generation performance compared with conventional training paradigms, demonstrating stronger UI element localization by MLLMs.

Conclusion: IAML effectively mitigates exposure bias and enhances precise GUI coordinate generation, with the IoU-based augmentation providing a practical path to bolster GUI understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSAMap: a global, high-resolution remote sensing dataset for large-scale, multi-feature land-cover vector mapping, enabling object-based tasks with 1.8M instances across 10 classes; provides a standardized benchmark and AI-assisted annotation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridges the gap between pixel-level segmentation and object-based vector modeling in remote sensing by addressing limited annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structure in existing datasets; aims to enable precise boundaries, topology, and global GIS/digital twin applications.

Method: Develops a comprehensive vector-annotated dataset with over 1.8 million instances across 10 object categories; employs an intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-assisted methods; offers global coverage (79 regions across six continents; >1,000 km) and supports multi-task objectives (pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline extraction, panoramic segmentation); provides a standardized benchmark for object-based mapping.

Result: Delivers a global, high-resolution, multi-feature land-cover vector dataset that supports diverse object-based tasks, accelerates geographic feature automation, and provides publicly accessible benchmarking data for the community; designed to aid global geographic information updates and digital twin construction.

Conclusion: IRSAMap addresses key limitations of prior RS datasets by enabling precise, topology-aware, large-scale object-based land-cover mapping and by fostering collaborative modeling and standardized benchmarking.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

TL;DR: Deep learning approach using U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder to detect methane plumes in Sentinel-2 imagery, augmented by dual spectral features (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression), capable of detecting small plumes down to 400 m2 and achieving 78.39% F1 on validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas; rapid, automated detection of small methane plumes from satellite imagery is crucial for monitoring and mitigation. Existing methods struggle with small plumes and lower sensitivity at moderate resolutions like Sentinel-2.

Method: A U-Net architecture with a ResNet34 encoder that integrates two spectral enhancement techniques—Varon ratio and Sanchez regression—as input features to improve plume sensitivity at 20 m Sentinel-2 resolution.

Result: The method attains a validation F1-score of 78.39% and can detect plume areas as small as 400 m2 (one pixel at 20 m resolution), outperforming traditional remote-sensing approaches in sensitivity and precision for small plumes.

Conclusion: The study presents a promising, scalable approach for automated methane monitoring from Sentinel-2 data, particularly effective for small plume detection, with potential implications for climate monitoring and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a
potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the
mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for
heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [43] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stream Mamba pyramid network for figure skating assessment that separately predicts Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) to align with judging criteria, addressing per-element TES, long videos, and separate audio-visual cues; claims state-of-the-art on FineFS with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TES and PCS evaluation requires per-element analysis, separation of action and interpretation cues, and efficient long-range context modeling. Prior methods reuse video/audio features for both TES and PCS, aggregate scores over time, and struggle with long competition videos.

Method: A two-stream architecture: TES stream uses a multi-scale Mamba pyramid and TES head to localize and score action elements across temporal scales; PCS stream uses multi-level fusion to combine visual and auditory cues across pyramid levels while keeping TES-derived features unaffected by PCS evaluation. The Mamba pyramid provides long-range dependency capture with linear computational complexity, enabling long videos.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Comprehensive experiments; ablations likely validate the two-stream design and fusion strategy. Code released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns TES and PCS evaluation with real judging criteria, handles action-element variability and long-range context efficiently, and achieves strong performance with reproducible open-source code.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Motivation: Digitizing handwritten marksheets is challenging due to diverse handwriting styles and complex table structures, creating a need for scalable, automated document understanding.

Method: OpenCV-based table detection to locate rows/columns; hand-written text recognition using YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 within detected tables, supplemented by PaddleOCR; evaluation on a custom dataset designed to capture diverse handwriting and complex layouts.

Result: Modified YOLOv8 attains 92.72% accuracy, surpassing PaddleOCR (91.37%) and YOLOv8 (88.91%); claims high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Proposes an operational, scalable integration of computer vision and OCR technologies for handwritten document digitization, reducing manual effort and benefiting academic and administrative document processing.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,

### [45] [A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-ORIENT is a multitask multimodal framework that uses cross-modal relation graphs and hierarchical interactive attention to produce robust multimodal representations without explicit cross-modal fusion, reducing noise and preserving unimodal discriminative information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in individual modalities degrades multimodal representations; traditional fusion can discard useful modality-specific information.

Method: Cross-modal relation graphs reconstruct monomodal features into multimodal representations by leveraging cross-modal neighborhood; Hierarchical Interactive Multimodal Attention (HIMA) emphasizes relevant information within each modality; the framework supports multitask learning and learns discriminative unimodal features before late fusion; cross-modal relations capture high-order interactions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three datasets shows improved performance and robust multimodal understanding across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT mitigates noise, preserves discriminative unimodal information, and enables effective cross-modal representations for multitask learning.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

### [46] [Exploiting Information Redundancy in Attention Maps for Extreme Quantization of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16311)
*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Entropy-based analysis reveals that some attention heads are more deterministic and contribute less information. By freezing low-entropy attention maps and quantizing them, the model reduces recomputation with minimal accuracy loss, achieving similar or better performance at up to ~20% sparsity on DeiT and Swin Transformer for ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHSA in transformer models is computationally and memory-intensive, hindering edge deployment. The authors seek to exploit information redundancy across attention heads to compress and accelerate inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Compute Shannon entropy of each attention head's maps to gauge information content. Identify low-entropy heads (more deterministic) and freeze their weights; quantize these attention values to low precision to avoid re-computation. Apply to DeiT and Swin Transformer architectures and evaluate on ImageNet-1k.

Result: Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that Entropy Attention Maps (EAM) achieve similar or higher accuracy at up to 20% sparsity in attention maps, with competitive performance beyond this level for DeiT and Swin Transformer models.

Conclusion: Entropy-based pruning and quantization of attention maps offer an effective, edge-friendly approach to speeding up Transformer inference by exploiting head-wise information redundancy with limited accuracy loss.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes image size-agnostic, task-driven vision encoders inspired by efficient biological vision; offers a proof-of-concept for image classification to show feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vast amount of visual data and energy constraints in vision systems by making encoders compute only as much as needed by the task, rather than scaling with image size.

Method: A position paper that frames a behavioral trait from biology—efficiency—as a design principle, arguing for dynamic, task-dependent computation; outlines concrete first steps and presents a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.

Result: Introduces and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a dynamic, task-driven encoding approach, showing feasibility and potential benefits, though detailed quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Vision encoders should be dynamic and size-agnostic, driven by task requirements to improve efficiency; the paper lays out a path with concrete initial steps toward this vision.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW is interpretable as a global self-attention mechanism; it outperforms Transformer by ~5% on Something-Something V2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret RTW as self-attention and gauge its similarities/differences with Transformer in motion recognition, and to assess its practical advantage.

Method: Analyze RTW contribution weights as self-attention weights, compare weight patterns via canonical-angle similarity (reported as 0.80 average across ten smallest angles), and empirically compare on the Something-Something V2 dataset.

Result: RTW and self-attention weights show high similarity (average correlation 0.80); RTW attends over the entire input sequence while standard self-attention uses a local view due to computational limits; RTW achieves a 5% accuracy improvement over Transformer on Something-Something V2.

Conclusion: RTW can be viewed as a form of global self-attention that can outperform Transformer-based approaches in motion recognition tasks, likely due to its full-sequence consideration.

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

*Yong Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Qiang Gao,Yi Wang,Bin Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBINet is a lightweight, real-time steel surface defect detector using group multiscale bidirectional interaction to accelerate multiscale feature learning with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time defect detection on steel surfaces is essential for quality and efficiency, but existing DL methods are often too heavy for resource-constrained industrial settings. There is a need for efficient cross-scale feature interaction to leverage multiscale representations without incurring high computational costs.

Method: Introduce GMBI (Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive) modules that use a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature extraction with scale-agnostic computational complexity, a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) for cross-scale interaction, and a parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation. The backbone is lightweight (DSConv-based) to maintain efficiency.

Result: On SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets, GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds: 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19M parameters. Additional evaluation on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset indicates strong generalization. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Conclusion: GMBINet delivers efficient multiscale feature extraction and cross-scale interaction with negligible overhead, enabling deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments and suggesting potential applicability to broader industrial vision tasks beyond surface defect detection.

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust multimodal fusion system for autonomous vehicles that combines RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated camera, and radar with attentive depth-based BEV refinement and a transformer decoder to adaptively weigh sensor inputs by distance and visibility, improving detection under adverse weather with a notable 17.2 AP gain for distant vulnerable pedestrians in fog.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objects must be reliably detected in adverse weather and sensor degradation conditions where single-sensor or standard fusion methods fail; bridging the gap between ideal and real-world edge cases in autonomous driving.

Method: Fusion of RGB, LiDAR, NIR gated camera, and radar using attentive, depth-based blending with refinement on the Bird's Eye View plane to fuse image and range features. A transformer decoder weighs modalities based on distance and visibility; learning attends to sensor reliability under poor conditions.

Result: Demonstrates improved reliability of multimodal fusion under challenging weather, achieving a 17.2 AP improvement over the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians at long distances in foggy scenes; project page provided.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robustness of multimodal fusion in autonomous vehicles in adverse weather, closing the gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

It uses a distilled image encoder (DUNE) and multi-heads for people segmentation, DensePose, and depth, producing a dense, semantically enriched 3D point map, validated on EgoHumans/EgoExo4D and generalizing to traditional MVS/pose tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., MASt3R, DUSt3R) excel outdoors with static scenes but struggle with human-centric environments. There is a need for a single, efficient, end-to-end approach that jointly reconstructs humans and scenes from sparse, uncalibrated views.

Method: HAMSt3R builds on a distilled encoder (DUNE) derived from MASt3R and multi-HMR, and adds network heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth prediction in human-centric contexts. The model outputs a dense 3D point map enriched with human semantic information in a fully feed-forward pipeline, trained/evaluated on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, with additional generalization tests to traditional MVS and multi-view pose regression tasks.

Result: The method reconstructs humans effectively while maintaining strong performance on general 3D reconstruction tasks. It demonstrates good generalization to traditional MVS and pose regression benchmarks, delivering a dense, semantically enriched 3D representation.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R bridges the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision by enabling efficient, end-to-end joint reconstruction from sparse views, with strong empirical results on human-centric benchmarks and evidenced generalization to broader 3D tasks.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

*Huimin Zeng,Yue Bai,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An integrated scale-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework enables arbitrary-scale super-resolution with a single model, using scale-aware rendering, generative priors, and progressive upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods render only fixed high-resolution scales, causing aliasing and inefficiency for arbitrary scales; a flexible, single-model SR framework is needed for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: Integrate scale-aware rendering with generative-prior-guided optimization and progressive super-resolution in 3DGS, supporting both integer and non-integer scale rendering within one model; avoids post-processing upsamplers.

Result: High-quality arbitrary-scale HR views achieved with a single model, 6.59 dB PSNR gain over vanilla 3DGS, preserved structural consistency across LR and scales, and real-time rendering at 85 FPS at 1080p.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables arbitrary-scale 3D Gaussian super-resolution with a single model, improving quality and efficiency while maintaining structural integrity.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

*Chun-Peng Chang,Chen-Yu Wang,Julian Schmidt,Holger Caesar,Alain Pagani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning video generation on driving data boosts visual realism but can reduce spatial/dynamic accuracy; replay-based continual learning helps preserve spatial correctness while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how fine-tuning video generators affects structured driving datasets and the potential misalignment between visual quality objectives and dynamic understanding; explore remedies to balance fidelity and dynamic accuracy for driving simulations and world models.

Method: Empirical analysis of existing fine-tuning approaches on driving datasets; assess correlation between visual quality and dynamic understanding; identify degradation in dynamic elements; propose simple continual learning with replay from diverse domains as alternative; compare methods on metrics of visual fidelity and spatial accuracy.

Result: Fine-tuning improves visual fidelity but may degrade spatial accuracy of dynamic elements due to focusing on dominant motion; driving scenes' regularity drives surface realism; replay from diverse domains can strike a balance by preserving spatial accuracy while keeping high visual quality.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between visual fidelity and dynamic accuracy when fine-tuning video generators on driving data; continual learning with replay provides a practical approach to maintain spatial accuracy without sacrificing quality; further work should align objectives to dataset structure.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey tracing the convergence of vision subfields and introducing Open World Detection (OWD) as a unifying framework for class-agnostic and broadly applicable detection, outlining history, concepts, methods, datasets, and the potential unification into a single perception domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation among vision perception tasks by highlighting their convergence and proposing OWD as a unifying paradigm for open world understanding.

Method: A comprehensive literature survey of foundational vision subdomains (saliency, foreground/background separation, out-of-distribution detection, open world/object detection, zero-shot detection, Vision LLMs), synthesize concepts, methodologies and datasets, and articulate the Open World Detection umbrella and its overlaps across subfields.

Result: Clarifies overlap and convergence among subdomains, introduces the Open World Detection umbrella, maps concepts and datasets, and discusses opportunities for a unified perception framework.

Conclusion: Vision subfields are converging toward a single, open-world perception domain; OWD serves as a forward-looking umbrella to guide cross-domain research, evaluation, and dataset development toward unified perception.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

### [55] [MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16577)
*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A retrieval-conditioned multiview diffusion approach (MV-RAG) improves out-of-domain and rare-concept text-to-3D generation by leveraging retrieved 2D images and a held-out view objective to enforce 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D methods relying on pretrained 2D diffusion priors struggle with out-of-domain or rare concepts, leading to inconsistent or inaccurate results. There is a need for better 3D consistency and broader concept coverage.

Method: Retrieve relevant 2D images from a large in-the-wild image database and condition a multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent multiview outputs. Train with a hybrid strategy: (1) augment conditioning views to simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction; (2) train on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images with a held-out view prediction objective where the model predicts the unseen view from the others to infer 3D consistency. Also introduce an OOD prompt collection for rigorous evaluation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines on 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while remaining competitive on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Retrieval-conditioned multiview diffusion with a held-out view objective enables robust OOD-aware text-to-3D generation and provides a framework for rigorous OOD evaluation, achieving better 3D fidelity without sacrificing standard performance.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

*Yijun Liu,Yuwei Liu,Yuan Meng,Jieheng Zhang,Yuwei Zhou,Ye Li,Jiacheng Jiang,Kangye Ji,Shijia Ge,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A spatial-aware visuomotor framework (SP) for embodied robotic manipulation that explicitly models spatial information to bridge visual plans and control, using three modules—spatial-conditioned video generation with a spatial plan table, spatial-based action prediction, and a spatial reasoning feedback policy with dual-stage replanning—achieving substantial gains over baselines and high task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-centric embodied models lack spatial awareness, hindering the translation of high-level visual plans into concrete, coordinated actions in complex environments.

Method: 1) Spatial-conditioned embodied video generation with a spatial plan table to model spatially guided predictions. 2) Spatial-based action prediction to infer executable, coordinated actions. 3) Spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning.

Result: SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline and an 86.7% average success rate across 11 tasks. Code and checkpoints are provided at the project URL.

Conclusion: Explicit spatial modeling and reasoning substantially enhance the practicality and effectiveness of embodied visuomotor models for robotic control, enabling more reliable long-horizon manipulation in complex environments.

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose: a zero-shot, model-free framework for 6D pose estimation and 3D reconstruction of novel objects using diffusion priors and 3D Gaussian splatting, with iterative view-fusion and pose-graph optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate dependence on object CAD models for 6D pose estimation, addressing practical cost and availability, by leveraging foundation-model priors while avoiding training-time hallucinations and geometry errors.

Method: From a single RGB-D frame, a multi-view diffusion model provides an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation and pixel-wise epistemic uncertainty. New views are fused incrementally, guided by uncertainty; global consistency is ensured by integrating diffusion-prior views and observations into a pose graph and jointly optimizing a coherent 3DGS field.

Result: Extensive experiments show UnPose achieves superior 6D pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, and demonstrates practical applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: UnPose enables zero-shot, model-free 6D pose estimation and reconstruction by combining diffusion priors, uncertainty-guided view fusion, and pose-graph optimization within a 3DGS representation, leading to robust performance without object CAD models.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

*Hung-Jui Huang,Mohammad Amin Mirzaee,Michael Kaess,Wenzhen Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GelSLAM is a real-time tactile-only 3D SLAM system that estimates object pose over long periods and reconstructs shapes with submillimeter accuracy, using tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop closure to enable global, long-horizon perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing can provide higher precision and immunity to occlusion compared to vision, making it especially valuable for in-hand and high-precision manipulation tasks; existing vision-based methods struggle with occlusion and texture-less objects, so a tactile-only solution could offer consistent, drift-resistant pose and shape estimation over long periods.

Method: A tactile-only SLAM pipeline (GelSLAM) that leverages tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures to perform robust tracking and loop closure in real time, enabling long-horizon pose estimation and high-fidelity shape reconstruction.

Result: Real-time tracking with low error and minimal drift; submillimeter accuracy in shape reconstruction even for low-texture objects (e.g., wooden tools). Demonstrates extended global perception beyond local contact.

Conclusion: GelSLAM extends tactile sensing from local contact to global, long-horizon spatial perception and could underpin precise manipulation tasks involving in-hand object interaction.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

*Akira Oyama,Shoichi Hasegawa,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal exophora resolution framework (MIEL) leveraging SSL, semantic mapping, VLMs, and GPT-4o-based interactive querying to resolve demonstratives in real-world robots, improving performance when the user is outside the visual field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exophoric language in daily-life robotics requires resolving references to objects or people not currently visible; existing vision-only approaches fail under occlusion or non-perception.

Method: Build a semantic map of the environment, estimate candidate objects from linguistic queries and user skeletal data, use sound source localization to locate users outside the robot's field of view, and engage in interactive clarification questions via GPT-4o when ambiguity remains.

Result: Real-world experiments show approximately 1.3× improvement when the user is visible and 2.0× improvement when the user is not visible, compared to methods lacking SSL and interactive questioning.

Conclusion: MIEL demonstrates a robust multimodal approach to exophora resolution that explicitly incorporates user localization to handle references outside the robot's visual field.

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

TL;DR: GP-based per-object contour SLAM using online recursive GP updates within a Bayesian framework, enabling semantic, probabilistic object-level maps with uncertainty on shapes; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of grid-based or point-cloud SLAM by developing a memory-efficient, object-centric representation that provides semantic information and probabilistic data associations.

Method: Represent each object with Gaussian Process–based contours, updated online via a recursive scheme. Formulate SLAM in a fully Bayesian framework to jointly infer robot pose and object-based map, including probabilistic object associations and confidence bounds on shapes.

Result: Achieves accurate localization and mapping in diverse structured environments, with semantic information (object count, areas) and shape uncertainty; demonstrated on synthetic and real-world experiments and efficient memory usage.

Conclusion: Object-centric GP contour SLAM yields semantically rich maps with quantified uncertainty, enabling safer navigation and robust exploration, and showing competitive performance across environments.

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

*Jiri Horyna,Roland Jung,Stephan Weiss,Eliseo Ferrante,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SWA enables robust state estimation for UAV swarms under ego-localization dropout by fusing decentralized estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensors to achieve velocity consensus and resilient cohesive behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Primary localization can fail or be unavailable, so relying on relative measurements and mutual perception is needed to maintain state awareness and coordination in multi-UAV swarms. This addresses the double integrator synchronization problem and enhances reliability and resilience.

Method: Decentralized state estimation fused with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data. Relative information estimates lateral state with respect to the local constellation, enabling identification of an unambiguous swarm state. The approach achieves velocity consensus (double integrator synchronization) while attenuating disturbances except for a uniform translation drift of the swarm.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments validate the approach, showing sustained cohesive swarm behavior under unreliable or unavailable primary localization and maintaining velocity consensus despite localization dropout.

Conclusion: SWA provides a viable framework for reliable, resilient multi-UAV coordination under intermittent localization, enabling tighter cooperation and expanding opportunities for robust swarm operations in challenging sensing conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

*Sophie Villemure,Jefferson Silveira,Joshua A. Marshall*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A terrain classifier for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot uses proprioceptive signals, dimensionality reduction, and classification to identify terrain type, achieving ~97% accuracy on three terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robot safety and navigation by predicting terrain traversability to build traversability maps and guide planning, reducing sinking/slipping.

Method: Process 100+ proprioceptive signals (foot penetration, forces, joint angles) via dimensionality reduction to extract relevant features, then apply a classifier to differentiate terrain based on traversability. Field tests with Spot.

Result: Three terrain types identified with ~97% accuracy.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of using proprioceptive signals and feature reduction for terrain classification to support safer navigation; potential for integration into traversability maps; scope limited to 3 terrains; future work may address generalization and real-time deployment.

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Jointly optimizes path and kinodynamic controls to compute a minimum-time trajectory for car-like robots, formulating a mixed-integer optimization that is relaxed to an MILP; achieves large speedups (≈104×) over MPPI-type planners while satisfying velocity, acceleration, and steering constraints.

Motivation: Need for fast, feasible kinodynamic planning for car-like vehicles in complex terrains that respects dynamic and geometric constraints and avoids poor local minima.

Method: Cast the problem as a mixed-integer fractional program with quadratic constraints; transform to a mixed-integer bilinear objective; relax to a mixed-integer linear program via McCormick envelopes; use simplicial complex representations for 3D terrains; jointly optimize the spatial path and the sequence of acceleration and steering controls under boundary conditions.

Result: Simulations against MPPI and log-MPPI show the proposed method is about 104 times faster while strictly satisfying the specified velocity, acceleration, and steering constraints.

Conclusion: The approach provides a fast, constraint-consistent solution for kinodynamic planning of car-like vehicles in complex environments, leveraging relaxations to MILP to enable efficient optimization with strong adherence to dynamic and control bounds.

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

*Yizhi Wang,Degang Xu,Yongfang Xie,Shuzhong Tan,Xianan Zhou,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical control framework combining DRL for high-level navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure feasible 4WISD operation; shows superior performance, training efficiency, and real-world viability compared to traditional or purely DRL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4WISD robots face conflicting goals: achieving efficient autonomous navigation while respecting rich kinematics and safety constraints (e.g., wheel slippage, mechanical strain). Pure DRL can be unstable or unsafe; traditional methods may be conservative or inefficient. A hierarchical approach seeks to blend learning-driven planning with rule-based feasibility guarantees.

Method: A two-tier architecture where a DRL agent generates global motion commands at the high level for navigation, while a fuzzy logic controller operates at the low level to enforce kinematic constraints and prevent wheel slip and mechanical strain. The integration aims to improve training efficiency, stability, and real-world feasibility. Evaluation includes simulations and real-world validations in dynamic industrial settings.

Result: The framework outperforms traditional navigation methods, enhances training efficiency and stability, and mitigates erratic behavior often seen in purely DRL solutions. Real-world tests demonstrate safe and effective navigation in dynamic industrial environments.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL+fuzzy logic hierarchical framework provides a scalable, reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex real-world scenarios, balancing performance with physical feasibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a

### [67] [Z-Pruner: Post-Training Pruning of Large Language Models for Efficiency without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15828)
*Samiul Basir Bhuiyan,Md. Sazzad Hossain Adib,Mohammed Aman Bhuiyan,Muhammad Rafsan Kabir,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman,Nabeel Mohammed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-training pruning method, Z-Pruner, reduces LLM size without retraining by using weight updates and activation patterns to prune redundant parameters, achieving superior zero-shot performance and lower perplexity on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT, with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are getting larger; pruning without retraining would enable deployment with lower energy and latency, but many existing pruning methods either degrade performance or need costly fine-tuning.

Method: Z-Pruner uses a criterion combining weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify redundant parameters and prune them in a single, retraining-free step; model-agnostic and efficient.

Result: On multiple architectures (LLaMA-2/3, OPT) it achieves the lowest perplexity and highest average zero-shot accuracy compared to state-of-the-art weight-update-based pruning methods.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner demonstrates that effective, efficient, retraining-free pruning of pretrained LLMs is possible; opens path for deployment of smaller models; code released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at
https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.

### [68] [PGF-Net: A Progressive Gated-Fusion Framework for Efficient Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15852)
*Bin Wen,Tien-Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, interpretable multimodal sentiment model (PGF-Net) with progressive intra-layer fusion, dynamic arbitration, and hybrid PEFT, achieving state-of-the-art results on MOSI with 3.09M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets efficient, interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis, addressing noise and parameter inefficiency in existing fusion methods by enabling deeper, context-dependent fusion within Transformer layers and a lightweight fine-tuning strategy.

Method: Introduces three innovations: (1) Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion via Cross-Attention that queries non-linguistic audio/visual features within deep Transformer layers; (2) Adaptive Gated Arbitration to balance original linguistic info with fused multimodal context; (3) Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning combining LoRA-based global adaptation with Post-Fusion Adapters, integrated into a hierarchical encoder.

Result: On MOSI, PGF-Net achieves MAE of 0.691 and F1-Score of 86.9% with only 3.09M trainable parameters, claiming state-of-the-art performance and favorable performance-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: PGF-Net delivers deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal fusion under parameter constraints, making it suitable for resource-limited settings while maintaining strong sentiment analysis performance.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

*Muhammad Fathur Rohman Sidiq,Abdurrouf,Didik Rahadi Santoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A streamlined ECG segmentation model that fuses spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions, replacing complex layers like BiLSTM to improve efficiency while maintaining high accuracy; includes XAI and physics-based AI for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG segmentation often relies on heavy architectures (e.g., BiLSTM), which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time monitoring. There is a need for efficient, accurate, and interpretable models that capture both temporal and spectral features of P, QRS, and T waves, with transparent decision-making.

Method: Replace multi-layer architectures with simpler components that integrate spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions to capture temporal and spectral features of P, QRS, and T waves. Apply Explainable AI to show how temporal and frequency features influence segmentation, and incorporate physics-based AI principles to clarify the decision process and enhance reliability.

Result: High segmentation accuracy reported: QRS 97.00%, T 93.33%, P 96.07%. Claimed improvements in computational efficiency and precise segmentation, making the approach practical for heart signal monitoring.

Conclusion: A simplified architecture with spectral analysis, probabilistic predictions, XAI, and physics-based AI achieves high accuracy and interpretable, efficient ECG segmentation, suitable for reliable heart signal monitoring.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

### [70] [TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated Prefill \& Decode Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881)
*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPLA partitions latent representations and per-head inputs across tensor-parallel devices, computes attention per shard, then all-reduces results. It preserves MLA's latent KV caching benefits while unlocking tensor-parallel efficiency, delivering ~1.8x speedups at long contexts with minimal accuracy loss and without retraining; compatible with MLA-prefill and FlashAttention-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In tensor-parallelism, attention heads are spread across devices and full KV caches must be loaded per device, eroding the memory and efficiency advantages of MLA. Gaps remain in maintaining latent compression while enabling TP. A method that preserves latent caches and enables per-head shard attention could improve throughput without retraining.

Method: Partition the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices. Each shard performs attention independently, followed by an all-reduce to combine results. Apply optional orthogonal transforms (e.g., Hadamard, PCA) before TP slicing to reduce cross-shard interference. The approach is drop-in compatible with MLA (supports MLA-style prefilling) and enables tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Can be implemented with FlashAttention-3.

Result: Achieves ~1.79x speedup for DeepSeek-V3 and ~1.93x speedup for Kimi-K2 at a 32K-token context. Maintains performance on Commonsense and LongBench benchmarks with minimal accuracy degradation when using orthogonal transforms. Keeps full latent representation per head (unlike GLA), and does not require retraining. Enables practical end-to-end acceleration.

Conclusion: TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking tensor-parallel efficiency. It remains full-featured with MLA compatibility, offers strong representational capacity, and supports practical deployment (e.g., via FlashAttention-3) with modest accuracy trade-offs when using orthogonal transforms.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based temporal causal discovery with gradient-based extraction and attention masking improves causal discovery and lag estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations in time-series causal discovery.

Method: A multi-layer Transformer forecaster captures long-range nonlinear temporal relations; gradient-based analysis extracts causal structure and time lags; attention masking integrates prior knowledge to enforce user-excluded links across layers.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.8% absolute improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.

Conclusion: This framework enables robust temporal causal discovery and inference, with priors via masking improving reliability and reducing spurious causal links.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

TL;DR: This paper critically reviews recent high-dimensional embedding methods, derives best-practice guidelines, benchmarks popular approaches across datasets, and discusses remaining challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation and lack of guidance in a rapidly growing embedding literature, ensuring coherent use and future progress.

Method: Comprehensive literature review, synthesis into best practices, and empirical evaluation of popular embedding methods on multiple datasets.

Result: A set of best practices for creating and using embeddings; benchmarking results highlighting strengths/weaknesses of popular methods; a roadmap of open problems and challenges.

Conclusion: Call for more coherence, standardized evaluation, and continued work to address open challenges in low-dimensional embeddings.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

*Bruna C. B. Charytitsch,María C. V. Nascimento*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GRASP variant augmented with Graph Representation Learning (GL-GRASP) using graph embeddings outperforms traditional GRASP on C-IGDP in terms of solution quality within time and scales to denser instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate cheaper, structural graph learning into a GRASP framework to exploit latent graph structure and improve constrained incremental graph drawing without incurring heavy learning costs.

Method: Hybridize GRASP with Graph Representation Learning, test multiple node embedding techniques (noting deep learning-based strategies perform best), assess via primal integral, compare with state-of-the-art GRASP, and run scalability tests with denser instances under fixed time.

Result: Best GL-GRASP variants achieve superior primal-integral performance vs GRASP baselines; deep-learning-based embeddings particularly effective; results robust to density increase in a fixed time budget.

Conclusion: GL-GRASP demonstrates robustness and improved performance, suggesting a viable, scalable route to combine GRL with metaheuristics for graph visualization tasks like C-IGDP; supports integrating cheap, data-driven learning into construction phase of GRASP.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides accurate, real-time monitoring of wheel flange wear and related track conditions, enhancing safety and efficiency, and is suitable for seamless integration with IoT-enabled railway infrastructures.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,

TL;DR: Adaptive discretization with optimistic elimination for contextual bandits under distribution shift; introduces preference-based regret based on Pareto-front distance, with upper bounds that generalize no-shift and vector-valued reward results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address non-stationary environments in contextual bandits where rewards are vector-valued and ordered by a preference cone; provide a meaningful performance metric (preference-based regret) and robust guarantees under distribution shift.

Method: An adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination policy that self-tunes to distribution shift; uses a Pareto-front based evaluation and a cone order to guide action elimination.

Result: Derives upper bounds on preference-based regret under various distribution-shift assumptions; bounds generalize existing no-shift and vector-valued results and scale gracefully with problem parameters under shift.

Conclusion: The proposed policy is robust to distribution shifts and the introduced preference-based regret provides a meaningful, unifying performance measure that extends prior results.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

TL;DR: The paper extends Equilibrium Propagation (EP) to deep networks by introducing intermediate error signals and knowledge distillation, addressing vanishing gradients, and achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 with deep VGG architectures, indicating scalable on-chip training potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EP cleanly estimates gradients with local learning but struggles with depth due to vanishing gradients; there is a need to enable deeper networks and practical on-chip training in neuromorphic hardware.

Method: Introduce intermediate error signals to improve information flow, integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP, enabling training of significantly deeper architectures.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with deep VGGs; demonstrates scalability and improved convergence of neuron dynamics; potential for real-world systems.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances EP, extending its scalability and applicability to deep networks and neuromorphic training.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

### [78] [Tessellation Groups, Harmonic Analysis on Non-compact Symmetric Spaces and the Heat Kernel in view of Cartan Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16015)
*Pietro Fré,Federico Milanesio,Marcelo Oyarzo,Matteo Santoro,Mario Trigiante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advances Cartan neural networks by building a rigorous mathematical foundation: layers modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces linked by solvable group homomorphisms; introduces TS vector bundles, tilings and separators; constructs automorphic groups and tiling structures, and develops new Laplacian/heat kernel representations with a conjectural Abel–Jacobi–Siegel theta strategy for explicit eigenfunctions on the Bolza surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a solid mathematical framework for Cartan neural networks through non-compact symmetric spaces, TS vector bundles, tilings, and automorphic structures, enabling principled harmonic analysis and explicit Laplacian eigenfunction constructions within a neural-inspired architecture.

Method: Group-theoretical construction of separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces U/H; construction of the Δ_{8,3,2} tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups; uniformization results for genus 3 Fermat quartic and genus 2 Bolza surface; new representations of the Laplacian Green function and Heat Kernel on hyperbolic spaces; setup for harmonic functions via spinor representations of pseudo-orthogonal groups; proposed Abel–Jacobi map to Jacobian variety with Siegel Theta function to construct Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza surface.

Result: Established a comprehensive framework: explicit separators and tiling groups for non-compact symmetric spaces; uniformization of notable Riemann surfaces; new Green function and heat kernel representations in hyperbolic spaces; a spinor-based approach to harmonic functions; and a concrete, though conjectural, strategy using Abel–Jacobi maps and Siegel theta functions for eigenfunctions on the Bolza surface.

Conclusion: The paper lays a cohesive mathematical program for Cartan neural networks, delivering concrete group-theoretic and analytic instruments and proposing a novel, testable pathway to obtain Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza surface via classical algebro-geometric maps.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Xiaoxue Yu,Xianfu Chen,Xing Xu,Zhifeng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces PAC-MCoFL, a MARL-based game-theoretic framework for federated learning across multiple SPs to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation; leverages Pareto Actor-Critic with expectile regression, TCAD for high-dimensional actions, and a scalable PAC-MCoFL-p variant; demonstrates improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI) in simulations, with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-cooperative dynamics in multi-SP FL hinder centralized optimization of cross-SP communication and computation resources due to privacy constraints and competing interests. A framework that can achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while accounting for heterogeneous risk profiles and scalability is needed.

Method: A game-theoretic MARL framework where SPs are agents optimizing client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. The approach integrates Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) with expectile regression to model risk-sensitive, Pareto-optimal policies. To handle high-dimensional actions, a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) is used for fine-grained control. A scalable variant, PAC-MCoFL-p, introduces a parameterized conjecture generator to reduce computation with provably bounded error, accompanied by theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: In simulations, PAC-MCoFL achieves about 5.8% improvement in total reward and 4.2% improvement in the hypervolume indicator (HVI) over latest MARL solutions. The method better balances individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The PAC-MCoFL framework provides convergence guarantees, Pareto-optimal equilibria, and superior performance in multi-SP FL scenarios, with scalable variants that reduce computational burden without sacrificing accuracy; it effectively handles heterogeneity and scalability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

### [80] [A State-Space Approach to Nonstationary Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16073)
*Shuilian Xie,Mahdi Imani,Edward R. Dougherty,Ulisses M. Braga-Neto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled, model-based framework for nonstationary discriminant analysis that embeds discriminant rules (LDA/QDA) in state-space models to handle temporal distribution drift, producing NSLDA/NSQDA with Kalman smoothing and extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical discriminant analysis assumes i.i.d. data, but class-conditional distributions drift over time, making stationary classifiers unreliable; a unified, data-efficient approach is needed for temporal distribution shift.

Method: Embed discriminant analysis in state-space models. For linear-Gaussian dynamics, adapt Kalman smoothing to multiple samples per time step; two extensions: (i) EM to jointly estimate unknown system parameters, (ii) a Gaussian mixture (GMM)-Kalman method to recover unobserved time labels and parameters. For nonlinear/non-Gaussian drift, use particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids and derive fully nonstationary discriminant rules.

Result: Simulations show consistent improvements over stationary LDA, QDA, and SVM baselines, with robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified, data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift by integrating discriminant analysis with state-space and smoothing methods, enabling nonstationary rules and practical extensions.

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

### [81] [On Task Vectors and Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16082)
*Luca Zhou,Daniele Solombrino,Donato Crisostomi,Maria Sofia Bucarelli,Giuseppe Alessio D'Inverno,Fabrizio Silvestri,Emanuele Rodolà*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task arithmetic has a solid theoretical basis: a task vector from one epoch of finetuning equals the negative gradient scaled by the learning rate; for multiple epochs, this is approximately true with a bounded second-order error. Empirically, the first-epoch gradient dominates, so merging single-epoch finetuned models can rival merging fully converged models; this reframes task arithmetic as approximate multitask learning and highlights early training dynamics in model merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a rigorous explanation for when and why task arithmetic works, bridging practice with theory and clarifying the role of early training dynamics in model merging.

Method: 1) Derive an exact equivalence between a one-epoch task vector and the negative gradient scaled by the learning rate under standard gradient descent. 2) Prove an approximate equivalence for multi-epoch finetuning with a second-order error bound for feed-forward networks. 3) Empirically validate on seven vision benchmarks, examining norm and direction of the first-epoch gradient relative to the finetuning trajectory.

Result: Exact one-epoch equivalence: task vector = -η ∇L. For multi-epoch finetuning, an approximate equivalence holds with a provable second-order bound. Empirically, the first-epoch gradient dominates in norm and direction across seven vision benchmarks, and merging single-epoch finetuned models often matches merging fully converged models.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic should be viewed as approximate multitask learning; early training dynamics play a critical role in effective model merging, explaining its empirical success and guiding practical use.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

### [82] [GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090)
*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Genetic Programming with a symmetric phase urgency function improves traffic signal control by representing phase urgency as the aggregation of two shared subtrees for turn movements, enabling consistent feature treatment and better performance across simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GP-based traffic signal control often treats phase features inconsistently across different phases. A symmetric phase urgency function provides a consistent representation by aggregating the urgencies of two turn movements within a phase, improving generalization and interpretability.

Method: Introduce a symmetric phase urgency function represented as the aggregation of two shared subtrees, each encoding the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. Evolve this function using Genetic Programming. Evaluate on CityFlow simulator with multiple real-world datasets, comparing to traditional GP representations.

Result: The symmetric urgency function representation significantly improves the performance of GP-evolved traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation across a wide range of scenarios. The learned policies are effective, human-understandable, and easily deployable.

Conclusion: The proposed symmetric phase urgency representation addresses inconsistent handling of common phase features, yields better-performing and interpretable policies, and is suitable for deployment in real-world traffic signal control systems.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

### [83] [Machine Learning for Medicine Must Be Interpretable, Shareable, Reproducible and Accountable by Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16097)
*Ayyüce Begüm Bektaş,Mithat Gönen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract argues that interpretable, shareable, reproducible, and accountable ML is essential for high-stakes medical AI; it advocates intrinsically interpretable models, accountability, uncertainty quantification, and privacy-preserving collaborative approaches to enable trustworthy, real-world clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory and trust challenges with black-box models in healthcare; need for transparency, reliability, and fairness in survival/risk prediction; enable cross-institutional data use without compromising privacy.

Method: Discuss intrinsically interpretable approaches (kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, deep kernel models) as alternatives to opaque networks; emphasize accountability via evaluation, fairness, and uncertainty quantification; explore generative AI and collaborative learning (federated learning, diffusion-based data synthesis) to support reproducible research and cross-institutional data integration.

Result: Provides a design framework and conceptual analysis rather than empirical results, outlining criteria and pathways for building trustworthy medical AI.

Conclusion: Rethink ML foundations along interpretability, shareability, reproducibility, and accountability to develop medical AI that is accurate, transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

### [84] [CommonKV: Compressing KV Cache with Cross-layer Parameter Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16134)
*Yixuan Wang,Haoyu Qiao,Lujun Li,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CommonKV is a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression that shares adjacent parameters via SVD, with adaptive budget allocation based on cosine similarity; it reduces memory with minimal performance loss and complements other quantization/eviction methods, achieving up to 98% compression in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face severe memory growth from the KV cache as sequence length increases. Existing cross-layer KV sharing methods require architectural changes or suffer large performance losses at high compression, creating a need for a training-free, efficient compression approach.

Method: Apply Singular Value Decomposition to enable weight sharing across adjacent parameters in cross-layer KV caches. Use adaptive budget allocation that assigns tighter compression budgets to more similar caches based on cosine similarity, preventing over-compression of dissimilar caches. The method is training-free and aims to produce a more mergeable latent KV cache; evaluate across multiple backbones and benchmarks (LongBench, Ruler).

Result: CommonKV consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer methods across various compression ratios. Its benefits are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction techniques, and combining CommonKV with these methods can reach up to about 98% overall compression without significant performance loss.

Conclusion: A training-free, SVD-based cross-layer KV cache compression approach (CommonKV) that leverages adjacent parameter similarity and adaptive budgeting yields substantial memory savings with minimal accuracy degradation and is compatible with other compression techniques, making large-scale LLM memory management more practical.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in literature on machine learning applications in micromobility, addressing challenges in efficiency, environmental impact, safety, and user experience by compiling datasets and surveying ML models and their use cases.

Method: Systematic survey of micromobility datasets and ML models. The authors categorize data by spatial/temporal/features, review ML approaches, discuss applications (demand prediction, energy management, safety), assess advantages and challenges, and propose directions for future research.

Result: Provides a structured inventory of datasets and ML methods, maps models to practical micromobility use cases, highlights gaps and needs (benchmarks, data diversity, safety considerations), and offers synthesized insights to guide researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: ML is essential for advancing micromobility, but progress requires more high-quality datasets, standardized benchmarks, and safety-focused ML research; the paper provides a roadmap for future work.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

*Huichi Zhou,Yihang Chen,Siyuan Guo,Xue Yan,Kin Hei Lee,Zihan Wang,Ka Yiu Lee,Guchun Zhang,Kun Shao,Linyi Yang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A memory-augmented, gradient-free online RL paradigm for adaptive LLM agents that uses a memory-augmented MDP (M-MDP) with an episodic memory and a neural case-selection policy to enable continual adaptation without gradient updates; instantiated as AgentFly and achieving strong GAIA and DeepResearcher results with notable OOD gains; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for LLM agents that can continually adapt to new tasks and environments without costly fine-tuning of model parameters, addressing rigidity of static workflows and the inefficiency of gradient-based updates.

Method: Formalize the problem as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP) equipped with a neural case-selection policy. Past experiences are stored in episodic memory (differentiable or non-parametric). The policy is updated via a memory rewriting mechanism using environmental feedback, while policy improvement uses memory retrieval. The authors instantiate this as AgentFly for deep research tasks and evaluate on GAIA (Pass@3: 87.88% validation; 79.40% test) and the DeepResearcher dataset (66.6% F1, 80.4% PM). They report that case-based memory provides 4.7% to 9.6% absolute gains on out-of-distribution tasks, outperforming gradient-based methods.

Result: AgentFly achieves top-1 on GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on the test set; on DeepResearcher, it attains 66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM, surpassing state-of-the-art training-based methods. Memory-based retrieval contributes substantial OOD gains (4.7–9.6 percentage points).

Conclusion: A scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing open-ended skill acquisition and deep research; code is released at the cited repository.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

*Yi Zhang,Zhenyu Liao,Jingfeng Wu,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies and analyzes collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, showing deterministic samplers overly concentrate samples in local data space due to a see-saw score-learning effect, with empirical validation and implications for training and sampling design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic samplers are widely used in diffusion models, yet their limitations are not well understood. The paper investigates a new failure mode (collapse errors) and how score learning across noise regimes interacts with sampling dynamics.

Method: Introduce a novel metric to quantify collapse errors; perform extensive empirical studies across settings; analyze underlying causes, including a see-saw effect between low- and high-noise score learning; apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to support the explanation; provide intensive empirical evidence.

Result: Collapse errors occur in ODE-based diffusion sampling across diverse settings; a see-saw effect in score learning causes misfitting in high-noise regimes coupled with deterministic sampler dynamics, leading to localized data concentration; empirical evidence supports the proposed explanation and effectiveness of existing mitigation approaches.

Conclusion: Calls for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, highlighting collapse errors as a fundamental issue in diffusion models and encouraging exploration of methods to address this interaction.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

*Yujie Li,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Tangwen Qian,Zhao Zhang,Yifan Du,Shaoming He,Fei Wang,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STA-GANN is a GNN-based kriging framework that tackles incomplete spatio-temporal data by learning valid and generalizable spatio-temporal patterns through decoupled timestamp shift sensing, dynamic metadata-driven spatial graphs, and adversarial transfer learning for unseen sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal forecasting with missing/inaccessible sensors suffers from invalid patterns and poor generalization. There is a need to capture dynamic spatial dependencies, temporal shifts, and to generalize to unknown sensors.

Method:  STA-GANN integrates three components: (i) Decoupled Phase Module to sense/adjust timestamp shifts; (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and contextual metadata; (iii) Adversarial transfer learning strategy to promote generalizability to unseen sensors and domains.

Result: Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields shows STA-GANN achieves superior performance and generalization, supported by theoretical analyses.

Conclusion:  STA-GANN effectively improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization in kriging tasks, handling temporal shifts and dynamic spatial dependencies, with robust empirical and theoretical support.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes LNS as a stochastic process and introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS with locally-informed proposals and hindsight relabeling, to escape local optima and boost sample efficiency, outperforming prior neural LNS on ILPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Greedy neural LNS solvers are prone to getting stuck in local optima and suffer from limited sample efficiency. A principled approach that enables exploration and data-efficient training is needed.

Method: Formulate LNS as a stochastic process and propose SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that uses locally-informed proposals to diversify neighborhoods and escape local optima. Introduce hindsight relabeling to train on self-generated data efficiently.

Result: Experimental results show SPL-LNS substantially surpasses prior neural LNS solvers on various ILP problems of different sizes.

Conclusion: SPL-LNS provides a robust enhancement to neural LNS by combining sampling-based proposals with hindsight relabeling, improving exploration and data efficiency; results motivate broader application to ILPs and related combinatorial problems.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

### [90] [Motor Imagery EEG Signal Classification Using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16179)
*Jamal Hwaidi,Mohamed Chahine Ghanem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A MiniRocket-based feature extractor with a linear classifier for MI-EEG classification achieves high accuracy and lower computational cost, outperforming a CNN-LSTM baseline on PhysioNet data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MI-EEG suffers from nonstationarity, time-variance, and inter-subject variability; there is a need for accurate, efficient multi-class motor imagery classification.

Method: Extract features using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket) and classify with a linear classifier; compare to a CNN-LSTM baseline; evaluate on PhysioNet dataset.

Result: MiniRocket achieved 98.63% mean accuracy; CNN-LSTM 98.06%; MiniRocket outperforms deep learning models with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach significantly enhances MI-EEG accuracy and provides insights into feature extraction and classification for MI-EEG.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

### [91] [GEM: A Scale-Aware and Distribution-Sensitive Sparse Fine-Tuning Framework for Effective Downstream Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16191)
*Sungmin Kang,Jisoo Kim,Salman Avestimehr,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM is a scale-aware, sparse fine-tuning framework for PEFT that uses gradient-to-weight ratios and entropy-guided masking to selectively update parameters relative to their initial scale, achieving up to 1.6% accuracy gains over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of parameters across general and domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PEFT updates maximize update size without considering a parameter's original scale, potentially yielding ineffective changes. A scale-aware approach aims to make updates more impactful relative to each parameter's magnitude.

Method: Compute gradient-to-weight ratio to prioritize updates proportional to initial parameter values; apply entropy-guided masking to determine how many parameters to tune per layer, adapting to parameter distribution; update a sparse subset accordingly.

Result: Empirical validation on GLUE, SuperGLUE (general-domain) and GSM8k, MBPP (domain-specific) shows GEM achieves up to 1.6% improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning, while updating only 0.1% of parameters.

Conclusion: GEM offers an effective, budget-aware PEFT method that yields better or comparable performance with much fewer trainable parameters, and generalizes across domains.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

### [92] [UMATO: Bridging Local and Global Structures for Reliable Visual Analytics with Dimensionality Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16227)
*Hyeon Jeon,Kwon Ko,Soohyun Lee,Jake Hyun,Taehyun Yang,Gyehun Go,Jaemin Jo,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO is a two-phase optimization of UMAP that first builds a skeletal layout with representative points and then projects remaining points to preserve regional structure, yielding better global structure preservation, with modest local loss, and improved scalability and stability over UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data are challenging to visualize; local methods exaggerate compactness and global methods miss cluster separations. A method that better preserves both global and local structures, while remaining scalable and stable, would enable more reliable visual analytics.

Method: UMATO divides UMAP optimization into two phases: (1) construct a skeletal layout using representative points to capture global/regional structure, (2) project the remaining points while preserving regional characteristics, improving global structure preservation without drastic loss of local structure.

Result: Quantitative experiments show UMATO outperforms standard DR methods (including UMAP) in preserving global structure, with a slight trade-off in local structure; it also demonstrates superior scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling; case studies illustrate faithful projections suitable for reliable visual analytics.

Conclusion: UMATO provides a more faithful balance between global and local structure in DR, offering improved global structure preservation, scalability, and stability, making it a robust tool for HD data analysis and visual analytics.

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

*Mayank Nagda,Jephte Abijuru,Phil Ostheimer,Marius Kloft,Sophie Fellenz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIANO is an autoregressive physics-informed neural network framework that stabilizes and improves accuracy for time-dependent PDEs by conditioning future predictions on the past and training with self-supervised rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs suffer from temporal instability and inaccuracy due to non-autoregressive, pointwise predictions in dynamical systems. An autoregressive design promises stability and better long-horizon predictions, with potential gains in applications like weather forecasting.

Method: PIANO redesignes PINNs into an autoregressive architecture that conditions future states on past states. It uses a self-supervised rollout during training and enforces physical constraints to maintain fidelity to governing equations.

Result: PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging time-dependent PDEs, with significant improvements in accuracy and stability over existing PINN-based methods, and also outperforms existing approaches in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: Autoregressive physics-informed networks can address temporal instability in PINNs, providing stable, accurate solutions for time-dependent PDEs and improved forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

TL;DR: An explainable AI framework analyzes cough sounds for COPD using CNNs on spectrograms with occlusion-based localization and five subband spectral analysis to extract interpretable markers distinguishing COPD and chronicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for interpretable, spectrally-resolved biomarkers in cough-based COPD diagnostics to better understand pathophysiology and improve translational potential.

Method: Train a CNN on time-frequency representations of cough signals; use occlusion maps to identify diagnostically relevant spectrogram regions; decompose highlighted regions into five frequency subbands for targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis.

Result: Spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups; reveals complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum; the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions and chronic from non-chronic patient groups using interpretable spectral markers.

Conclusion: Frequency-resolved XAI analysis provides physiological insight and supports translational respiratory diagnostics, demonstrating the value of interpretable spectral markers in biomedical signal interpretation.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

*Habeeb Balogun,Yahaya Zakari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prophet can match or outperform LSTM for monthly pollutant forecasting in low-resource settings; simple models can be competitive with deep learning when data are irregular; model-data alignment and context matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data irregularities and scarcity in low-resource regions hinder accurate air quality forecasting. Northern Nigeria presents high pollutant levels with limited comparative studies. The paper aims to compare advanced ML models (LSTM) and a simpler, time-series approach (Facebook Prophet) under practical constraints to guide model choice.

Method: Empirical comparison of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Facebook Prophet for forecasting multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018–2023 across 19 states. Evaluation on series with seasonal/long-term trends versus abrupt structural changes.

Result: Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends; LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes.

Conclusion: Deep learning does not inherently outperform simpler approaches. Model-data alignment is crucial. For policymakers in resource-constrained settings, context-sensitive, computationally efficient forecasting methods may be preferable over model complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

### [96] [FEST: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Synthetic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16254)
*Weijie Niu,Alberto Huertas Celdran,Karoline Siarsky,Burkhard Stiller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FEST, a holistic framework to evaluate synthetic tabular data by combining privacy (attack-based and distance-based) and utility (similarity and ML performance) metrics, implemented as an open-source Python library and tested on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive, standardized framework to simultaneously evaluate privacy guarantees and data utility for synthetic tabular data, hindering robust benchmarking and comparison of generation methods.

Method: Develop FEST as an integrated evaluation library that combines diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based) with similarity and ML utility metrics; implement in Python; validate on multiple datasets and compare different synthetic data generation models.

Result: FEST provides a holistic assessment of the privacy-utility trade-off and enables systematic benchmarking of synthetic data generators; demonstrated effectiveness across datasets; source code available on GitHub.

Conclusion: FEST fills a gap in synthetic data evaluation by offering a modular, open-source framework for comprehensive privacy-utility benchmarking of synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

### [97] [Chunked Data Shapley: A Scalable Dataset Quality Assessment for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16255)
*Andreas Loizou,Dimitrios Tsoumakos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh) provides scalable, accurate data-quality assessment by chunking datasets and estimating chunk contributions, delivering major speedups and reliable detection of low-quality regions for classification and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As datasets grow, data quality evaluation becomes crucial for reliable ML. Data Shapley offers principled data valuation, but computing exact Shapley values is NP-hard and scaling to large datasets is intractable; thus scalable approximations are needed.

Method: Divide the dataset into manageable chunks and estimate each chunk's contribution using optimized subset selection and single-iteration stochastic gradient descent, enabling scalable Shapley-based data valuation while preserving accuracy in identifying high-/low-quality data regions.

Result: Empirical benchmarks on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks show C-DaSh achieves substantial computational speedups (80x–2300x) and improved accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions compared with existing Shapley approximations.

Conclusion: C-DaSh enables practical, scalable measurement of dataset quality on large tabular datasets for both classification and regression pipelines, making Shapley-based data valuation feasible in real-world settings.

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of federated tuning for LLMs, proposing a taxonomy by model access and parameter efficiency, classifying FedLLM methods into white-box, gray-box, and black-box, and reviewing black-box API-based approaches along with open challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, efficient federated tuning of large language models in realistic settings where access to LLM internals is restricted and where computational/communication costs are prohibitive.

Method: Develop a two-axis taxonomy (model access-based and parameter efficiency-based) and categorize existing FedLLM approaches into white-box, gray-box, and black-box; synthesize findings and analyze black-box inference API literature; highlight representative methods.

Result: A structured map of FedLLM techniques and representative methods per category; identification of open challenges and promising research directions.

Conclusion: Black-box FedLLM and inference APIs hold promise for practical FL of LLMs, but require further work on benchmarks, privacy guarantees, and scalable protocols; future research should focus on robust, efficient black-box tuning methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

### [99] [Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269)
*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learn latent, sparse auxiliary knowledge concepts for exercises using a deep model; improves knowledge tracing and recommendations beyond human-annotated KCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs) can be incomplete, noisy, or overly general. Latent auxiliary KCs aim to capture underlying conceptual structure to improve student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendations.

Method: Train a deep learning model to produce sparse binary representations (auxiliary KCs) for exercises. These latent concepts complement classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern DL KT architectures. Evaluate on student modeling and recommendation tasks, including RL policies and expectimax planning in simulated environments.

Result: Augmenting traditional BKT with auxiliary KCs improves predictive performance. For recommendations, auxiliary KCs enhance RL-based policies and expectimax planning, yielding measurable gains in simulated student learning outcomes.

Conclusion: Auxiliary KCs provide a latent, human-annota­tion-agnostic concept layer that improves KT and adaptive recommendations, compatible with both classical and modern architectures and potentially boosting learner outcomes.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE introduces a retrieval-enhanced feedback framework using an error-book and three structured queries (Feed-Target, Feed-Check, Feed-Path) to guide error analysis and corrective actions in multimodal LLMs, achieving faster inference with lower cost and improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a systematic framework for analyzing and mitigating errors in Multimodal LLMs, especially given the added complexity of visual inputs, and to improve efficiency and generalization through structured, targeted feedback.

Method: A teacher-student setup where the teacher provides structured feedback composed via three queries (Feed-Target to prioritize relevant visual info, Feed-Check to diagnose failure points, Feed-Path to propose corrective actions) and uses a curated error-book. It optimizes retrieval of feedback to avoid redundant data and reduces token usage, enabling scalable interaction.

Result: Empirical results show substantial speedups and reduced computational costs, with successful generalization across tasks, indicating that structured feedback can meaningfully improve multimodal reasoning without heavy retrieval overhead.

Conclusion: REFINE demonstrates a scalable, efficient approach to error-driven improvement in multimodal reasoning by organizing errors and feedback into a compact, targeted retrieval mechanism, suggesting strong potential for real-world MLLM applications with limited compute.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in threat assessment by integrating capabilities and intents, and avoid overfitting from separate reliability/security analyses in space-network contexts.

Method: Three-step framework: (1) algorithm to extract characteristic signal properties for intuitive threat understanding; (2) multitask learning architecture with one task estimating reliability-related capabilities and another deciphering attacker intent; (3) adaptable threat assessment aligned with varying security and reliability requirements.

Result: The framework enhances threat-detection robustness, outperforms conventional sequential methods, and enables space networks with intershell links to tackle complex threat scenarios.

Conclusion: A holistic, adaptable CPA approach provides more accurate threat assessments in space networks and highlights the value of jointly modeling capability and intent.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with core biological reasoning; need verifiable, curated data to guide models toward translational biology goals.

Method: Create eight benchmark datasets totaling 300k+ verifiable Q&A pairs on drug discovery challenges; post-train open-source LLMs with RL from Verifiable Rewards to align outputs with verifiable, domain-specific knowledge; evaluate single-task vs multi-task training and cross-task generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated biological data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized LLMs, advancing AI-driven biological discovery and addressing the biological reasoning gap.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

TL;DR: An online unsupervised fault-detection framework for water networks using LSTM-VAE and dual drift detection to identify blockages and background leakages in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water Distribution Networks are vital but face pipe blockages and background leakages, with data non-stationarity and limited labels making supervised fault detection challenging; an unsupervised, adaptive approach is needed.

Method: An unsupervised, online learning framework that combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism to detect two fault modes: blockages as collective anomalies and leakages as concept drift. The design is lightweight and memory-efficient for edge-level, real-time monitoring, validated on two realistic WDNs.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms strong baselines for anomaly detection and drift adaptation, demonstrates robustness to recurrent drift, and enables real-time, edge-level monitoring in dynamic WDN environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for unsupervised event detection in dynamic water distribution networks and is suitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, addressing non-stationarity and limited labeling.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

### [104] [Probabilistic Pretraining for Neural Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16355)
*Boris N. Oreshkin,Shiv Tavker,Dmitry Efimov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NIAQUE introduces Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile Estimation for probabilistic regression transfer learning. By pre-training on diverse datasets and fine-tuning on a target task, it achieves improved task performance and competitive results in Kaggle competitions against strong baselines like TabPFN and TabDPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic regression transfer learning is underexplored; there is a need for models that can leverage knowledge across diverse regression tasks while delivering reliable uncertainty estimates.

Method: Propose NIAQUE, a neural network model leveraging permutation invariance for probabilistic regression. Train via pre-training on diverse regression datasets, then fine-tune on a specific target dataset to enable task-specific probabilistic quantile estimation.

Result: Pre-training plus fine-tuning improves performance on individual regression tasks. NIAQUE performs well in Kaggle competitions against strong baselines including tree-based models and neural foundation models TabPFN and TabDPT.

Conclusion: NIAQUE is a robust, scalable framework for probabilistic regression that effectively leverages transfer learning to enhance predictive performance and uncertainty estimation across tasks.

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This
work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile
Estimation, a new model designed for transfer learning in probabilistic
regression through permutation invariance. We demonstrate that pre-training
NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on
a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks,
showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore,
we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong
baselines involving tree-based models and recent neural foundation models
TabPFN and TabDPT. The findings highlight NIAQUE's efficacy as a robust and
scalable framework for probabilistic regression, leveraging transfer learning
to enhance predictive performance.

### [105] [RotaTouille: Rotation Equivariant Deep Learning for Contours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16359)
*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille introduces a complex-valued, rotation- and cyclic-shift-equivariant deep learning framework for contour data, leveraging complex circular convolution and specialized nonlinearities and pooling to produce invariant representations for classification, reconstruction, and regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contours are common in many domains and are often subject to planar rotations and arbitrary starting points along an ordered edge-point sequence. Achieving equivariance to these transformations can improve generalization and data efficiency.

Method: The approach uses complex-valued circular convolution to enforce rotation and cyclic shift equivariance. It defines equivariant nonlinearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling to obtain invariant representations, collectively forming the RotaTouille framework for learning from contour data.

Result: Experiments on shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in leveraging contour structure with the desired equivariances.

Conclusion: RotaTouille provides a principled mechanism to learn from contour data with explicit rotation and cyclic-shift equivariance and offers components to produce invariant representations for downstream tasks, showing promise across contour-related domains.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

### [106] [Applications and Challenges of Fairness APIs in Machine Learning Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16377)
*Ajoy Das,Gias Uddin,Shaiful Chowdhury,Mostafijur Rahman Akhond,Hadi Hemmati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A qualitative study of 204 GitHub repositories using 13 open-source ML fairness APIs, revealing usage patterns, use-cases, and developer challenges in bias detection/mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how bias detection and mitigation APIs are used in practice, the challenges developers face, and to inform research and education.

Method: Qualitative empirical study; analyze 204 GitHub repositories that use 13 fairness APIs; identify usage scenarios, purposes, and developer challenges.

Result: APIs used mainly for two purposes (learning and solving real-world problems) across 17 use-cases; developers show limited bias detection/bias mitigation expertise; frequent troubleshooting and resource requests; developers seek opinions/resources.

Conclusion: Findings inform future bias-related software engineering research and curriculum development; highlight need for better documentation, support, and education for developers adopting fairness APIs.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

### [107] [Sequential Cohort Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16386)
*Hortence Phalonne Nana,Christos Dimitrakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair cohort (university admissions) selection under one-shot vs sequential policies, using a population model trained on prior cycles; analyzes fairness properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fair, transparent admissions in the face of uncertainty about applicant populations, balancing efficiency and fairness.

Method: Compare fixed one-shot policies with sequentially updated policies; train a population model from previous cycles; optimize admission decisions; assess fairness properties.

Result: The abstract presents a framework for policy optimization and fairness analysis; concrete empirical results are not stated, but the approach enables studying trade-offs between efficiency and fairness.

Conclusion: Highlights how policy design (one-shot vs sequential) affects fairness notions such as meritocracy and group parity in admissions and motivates adaptive, transparent decision-making.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

### [108] [Fast and Accurate RFIC Performance Prediction via Pin Level Graph Neural Networks and Probabilistic Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16403)
*Anahita Asadi,Leonid Popryho,Inna Partin-Vaisband*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient, topology-aware GNN for RF circuit performance prediction across multiple topologies, using a device-terminal graph representation and masked autoregressive flow heads to capture complex distributions, achieving high accuracy with significantly fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting RF circuit performance is challenging due to nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high cost of traditional simulators. Existing ML surrogates often need large datasets to generalize across topologies and to model skewed/multimodal metrics. A data-efficient, topology-aware approach is needed for rapid RF design automation.

Method: Model circuits at the device-terminal level as graphs to preserve fine-grained connectivity and enable scalable message passing. Use a graph neural network with topology awareness and incorporate masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads to robustly model complex distributions of RF metrics across multiple topologies (LNAs, mixers, VCOs, PAs). Train on datasets spanning these topologies.

Result: Achieves high prediction accuracy with symmetric MAPE (sMAPE) of 2.40% and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.91% on average. The MRE is improved by 3.14x, while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior work, demonstrating improved data efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach enables rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation with a topology-aware, data-efficient model that can handle complex, multimodal RF metric distributions and scale across diverse circuit topologies.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

### [109] [Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420)
*Yue Pei,Hongming Zhang,Chao Gao,Martin Müller,Mengxiao Zhu,Hao Sheng,Haogang Zhu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Doctor improves target alignment in offline RL by double-checking transformer-based policies against target returns, enabling precise control within and beyond the dataset; demonstrated on the EpiCare healthcare benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL methods via supervised learning struggle to reliably align achieved returns with user-specified targets, especially during interpolation/extrapolation; real-world needs demand precise, controllable policy performance.

Method: Introduce Doctor: Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Enhances a transformer-based RvS framework (e.g., Decision Transformer) with an explicit target-alignment mechanism to ensure actual returns match specified targets across in-dataset and out-of-distribution regions.

Result: Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset and enables accurate, flexible control over policy performance; demonstrated on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark EpiCare, where it modulates treatment aggressiveness while balancing therapeutic returns with adverse event risk.

Conclusion: The approach advances offline RL by improving return-target alignment in RvS transformers, enabling precise policy-performance control and broad applicability to settings like healthcare where risk–return tradeoffs are critical.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

### [110] [Boardwalk: Towards a Framework for Creating Board Games with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16447)
*Álvaro Guglielmin Becker,Gabriel Bauer de Oliveira,Lana Bertoldo Rossato,Anderson Rocha Tavares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can implement digital board games from natural-language rules, with Claude 3.7 Sonnet performing best (~55.6% error-free); API constraints raise errors, but the approach shows viability for a broad framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs can rapidly produce playable, rule-compliant digital versions of board games from natural-language descriptions and to identify challenges and model-to-model differences for a potential LLM-assisted board-game code generation framework.

Method: Three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) were tasked with coding 12 board games (both popular and obscure) in free-form and within Boardwalk, a General Game Playing API. Games were anonymized to avoid pre-trained knowledge. Implementations were evaluated for playability and rule compliance, and success rates and common errors were analyzed across models and game popularity.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet yielded the best performance with 55.6% of games produced without any errors. API compliance increased error frequency, but the severity of errors depended more on the LLM. Overall, the approach is viable and supports future steps toward integrating this process into a broader framework for accessible board game coding.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates viability of LLM-assisted board-game code generation and outlines steps toward building a framework that lowers barriers to elaborating board games, though API constraints and model differences influence error patterns and success rates.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

### [111] [NOSTRA: A noise-resilient and sparse data framework for trust region based multi objective Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16476)
*Maryam Ghasemzadeh,Anton van Beek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOSTRA is a trust-region Bayesian optimization framework designed for noisy, sparse MOBO data. It uses prior uncertainty and trust regions to build better surrogates and concentrate sampling in regions that improve the Pareto frontier, achieving greater data efficiency under experimental noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOBO in practical settings often faces sparse (non-space-filling), scarce (few observations) data with experimental uncertainty, where repeated inputs yield varying outputs. Such conditions occur in physical experiments and simulations, making conventional MOBO ineffective and wasting resources. There is a need for methods that integrate uncertainty information and adaptively focus search to promising regions.

Method: NOSTRA integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty into surrogate modeling and employs trust-region based sampling to constrain and refine the search space. It prioritizes samples that enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto frontier, and iteratively shrinks/adjusts trust regions to concentrate data collection where improvements are most likely.

Result: Across two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, NOSTRA outperforms existing MOBO approaches in handling noisy, sparse, and scarce data. It effectively prioritizes sampling in regions that most improve the Pareto frontier, leading to faster convergence, better data efficiency, and higher-quality solutions under budget constraints.

Conclusion: NOSTRA provides a practical, resource-efficient framework for multi-objective optimization under noisy and limited data. By leveraging uncertainty priors and trust regions, it accelerates Pareto frontier convergence and offers robust performance in scenarios with experimental budgets.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

*Jonathan Nöther,Adish Singla,Goran Radanovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bad-ACTS: a taxonomy and benchmark to study robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against adversarial agents; finds high attack success and suggests message-monitoring defenses; provides a 4-system benchmark and 188-case dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe deployment of agentic systems by understanding the range of potential harms and by enabling rigorous security evaluation across environments, tools, and communication patterns.

Method: Introduce a harms taxonomy; build BAD-ACTS with 4 agentic-system implementations across distinct environments; curate 188 harmful-action examples; simulate an attacker controlling one agent to coerce others into a target action; evaluate with prompting-based defenses; propose a message-monitoring defense.

Result: Attacks show high success rate; a single compromised agent can significantly undermine security; simple prompting defenses are inadequate; a message-monitoring defense offers stronger protection (per authors).

Conclusion: BAD-ACTS offers a diverse, realistic testbed for security research on agentic systems; encourages development of robust defenses; code and benchmark available at github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at
github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

### [113] [FraPPE: Fast and Efficient Preference-based Pure Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16487)
*Udvas Das,Apurv Shukla,Debabrota Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FraPPE provides an efficient max-min solution for the lower bound in preference-based pure exploration, enabling O(KL^2) time for K arms and L objectives, with asymptotically optimal sample complexity and superior empirical performance in identifying the Pareto set under arbitrary preference cones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem is to identify the set of Pareto-optimal arms in a multi-objective bandit under a given preference cone, with confidence guarantees. Existing methods lack a computationally efficient way to optimally track the lower bound for arbitrary cones, hindering scalability and practical use.

Method: Three structural properties of the lower bound are proven to enable a tractable reduction of the minimisation problem. A Frank-Wolfe optimiser is used to accelerate the maximisation step in the lower bound, culminating in the FraPPE algorithm which solves the maxmin problem.

Result: Achieves an O(KL^2) time solution for the max-min problem in a bandit with K arms and L-dimensional rewards, a significant acceleration over prior work. FraPPE asymptotically attains the optimal sample complexity for identifying the exact Pareto set under the given preference cone. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets show FraPPE requires the lowest sample complexity among existing algorithms.

Conclusion: FraPPE successfully closes the computational gap in PrePEx by efficiently optimizing the lower-bound max-min problem, delivering both theoretical optimality (in sample complexity) and empirical efficiency in identifying the Pareto set under arbitrary cones.

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

*Kevin Tirta Wijaya,Michael Sun,Minghao Guo,Hans-Peter Seidel,Wojciech Matusik,Vahid Babaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankRefine is a model-agnostic post hoc method that refines regression with pairwise rankings, requiring no retraining and leveraging a small reference set. It yields data-efficient improvements, e.g., up to 10% relative MAE reduction in molecular property prediction using 20 LLM-derived comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction of continuous properties is crucial, but deep regressors need abundant labels. In data-scarce settings, accuracy drops. Incorporating expert-derived pairwise rankings as a lightweight, post hoc refinement can boost performance without retraining.

Method: RankRefine is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic post hoc approach that combines a base regressor output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting. It uses a small reference set with known properties and a set of pairwise rankings to refine predictions without retraining.

Result: Demonstrated in molecular property prediction: up to 10% relative MAE reduction using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained from a general-purpose LLM, with no fine-tuning. Rankings from humans or LLMs can improve regression across domains, enabling practical improvements in low-data settings.

Conclusion: RankRefine offers practical, broad applicability in low-data regimes by leveraging simple, universally available rankings to refine existing regressors without retraining.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

### [115] [On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496)
*Scott Jeen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot RL under real-world constraints: proposes a suite of methods to cope with small homogeneous data, partial observability, and limited data access, supported by empirical studies that reveal current methods' failures and validate proposed remedies, aiming for deployable real-world RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of RL requires generalization without extensive trial-and-error. Simulators are often imperfect, leading to misalignment between training and deployment; zero-shot RL must handle data quality, observability, and data-availability constraints.

Method: Introduce a suite of zero-shot RL methods designed to operate under the three constraints (data quality, observability, data availability). Use empirical studies to reveal failings of existing methods and justify the proposed remedies.

Result: Empirical investigations expose shortcomings of current zero-shot RL approaches under realistic constraints and validate the proposed remedies, marking progress toward deployable real-world RL.

Conclusion: The work advances designs that move RL closer to real-world deployment, while acknowledging that further improvements are needed for fully reliable zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

### [116] [MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503)
*Nadia Asif,Zhiqing Hong,Shaogang Ren,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaojun Shang,Yukun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuST2-Learn is a multi-view learning framework that jointly models spatial, temporal, and service-type factors to predict municipal service request times, achieving substantial MAE reductions on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-emergency city services (e.g., 311) lack transparency about response times. Predicting service times is hard due to dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, heterogeneous request types, and high intra-type variation, which affects resident satisfaction.

Method: A multi-view architecture with an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among heterogeneous service types, an intra-type variation encoder for variation within homogeneous types, and a spatiotemporal encoder to model spatial-temporal correlations. These components are integrated into MuST2-Learn and evaluated on two real-world datasets.

Result: MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by at least 32.5% compared with state-of-the-art baselines and outperforms existing methods on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view framework effectively captures cross-type interactions and spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to substantial improvements in service-time prediction for municipal services and potentially enhancing transparency and resident satisfaction.

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

*Parker Seegmiller,Kartik Mehta,Soumya Saha,Chenyang Tao,Shereen Oraby,Arpit Gupta,Tagyoung Chung,Mohit Bansal,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAMES systematically analyzes data-synthesis strategies for synthetic math reasoning with LLMs, deriving practical guidelines and creating a blended FLAMES dataset; it reports strong generalization and outperforms baselines on multiple benchmarks after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fair comparison of data-synthesis strategies and understand factors in the synthetic data pipeline (e.g., filtering, difficulty, coverage), addressing gaps left by prior work that used disparate setups.

Method: Introduce FLAMES framework; study 10 existing data-synthesis strategies and multiple factors; derive insights about difficulty-diversity balance; design two novel strategies; build FLAMES dataset blending existing and novel data; fine-tune Qwen2.5-Math-7B on FLAMES; evaluate on benchmarks including OlympiadBench, CollegeMath, GSMPlus, MATH; compare to public datasets; report out-of-domain generalization.

Result: Key findings: increasing problem complexity yields best improvements on many math metrics; with fixed data budget, broader problem coverage matters more than filtering for reliable solutions; GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data can boost competition benchmarks; FLAMES-derived data improve performance (+15.7 on OlympiadBench, +4.5 on CollegeMath, +6.5 on GSMPlus, +3.1 on MATH); fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on FLAMES reaches 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger models such as Llama3 405B, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: FLAMES provides a principled framework and practical guidance for synthetic data design, highlighting the value of problem difficulty, coverage, and diversity; the FLAMES dataset and novel strategies improve out-of-domain generalization and robustness, and can outperform public datasets on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### [118] [Guiding Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning for Stable Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16521)
*Zhijian Zhou,Junyi An,Zongkai Liu,Yunfei Shi,Xuan Zhang,Fenglei Cao,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that injects physics-based feedback into diffusion-based 3D molecular generation to improve stability and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where diffusion models with equivariant networks generate geometries that may violate physical principles (e.g., force-field consistency), leading to less stable molecules.

Method: RLPF extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. It models generation as a Markov decision process and uses proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. It introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations to provide direct physical feedback guiding towards energetically stable structures.

Result: On QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets, RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods, demonstrating the benefit of physics-based feedback in generative modeling.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics-based feedback via reinforcement learning yields more physically meaningful and stable 3D molecular structures, highlighting the value of physics-guided diffusion approaches in molecular generation.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes PSD, a first-order method to escape strict saddles with explicit constants; achieves near-optimal second-order stationary points with controlled query complexity; includes PSD-Probe and PSGD variants and supports empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of escaping strict saddle points in non-convex optimization using first-order methods; provide explicit constants and separation between descent and escape phases; enable rigorous guarantees and practical variants.

Method: Introduce Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with explicit constants; analysis for functions with ell-Lipschitz gradient and rho-Lipschitz Hessian; provides gradient evaluation bounds for descent and per-escape episode costs; log-dimension dependence; algorithmic variants PSD-Probe (finite-difference) and PSGD (stochastic).

Result: Proves PSD finds an (epsilon, sqrt(rho epsilon))-approximate second-order stationary point with high probability; total gradient evaluations bounded by O(ell Delta_f / epsilon^2) for descent; per-escape cost O((ell / sqrt(rho epsilon)) log(d/delta)); number of episodes O(ell Delta_f / epsilon^2); empirical validation on synthetic and ML tasks; confirms dimension log-scale and per-episode decrease.

Conclusion: Delivers fully specified algorithms with explicit constants, rigorous theory and empirical validation; offers practical extensions (finite-difference, stochastic), reinforcing the viability of first-order saddle-escaping methods.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

*Adam O. Rawashdeh,Jason T. L. Wang,Katherine G. Herbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An LSTM with attention for solar storm prediction that adds post hoc, model-agnostic interpretability to explain factors driving predictions, claimed as the first such interpretability work for LSTM-based solar-storm models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are black boxes; lack of transparency challenges trust and reliability in solar storm forecasting. Introducing interpretability aims to reveal temporal factors in active-region data that drive predictions of CMEs with flares.

Method: Treat active-region data as time series and use an LSTM with attention to capture temporal dynamics; apply post hoc, model-agnostic interpretability techniques to identify factors contributing to a prediction for input sequences and to gain insights across multiple sequences within an active region.

Result: The abstract claims interpretability is added to an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model and that this is the first time such interpretability has been applied to this type of model; no empirical results are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of adding post hoc interpretability to LSTM-based solar storm prediction, enabling accountability and reliability in the model’s outputs.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

*Hangzhan Jin,Sicheng Lv,Sifan Wu,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-FT recovers much OOD loss from SFT but cannot fully recover under severe overfitting; directional drift in singular vectors matters more than magnitude; low-rank and shallow-layer interventions offer cheap recovery before RL fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how post-training stages (SFT and RL-FT) reshape model representations and OOD performance using an OOD card-game variant and spectrum-based diagnostics.

Method: Spectrum-based diagnostics on models after SFT and RL-FT; analyze singular vectors/values, direction shifts; experiments on Llama-11B and Qwen-7B; assess top-20% value directions and first 25% layers; test low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets.

Result: RL-FT recovers a large portion of SFT-induced OOD performance loss, but not fully when SFT causes severe overfitting; directional shifts in singular vectors drive most OOD changes; recovery is possible by targeting top-20% directional vectors or early layers, restoring ~70-80% of OOD performance; stronger SFT checkpoints improve RL recovery, overly overfitted ones resist restoration.

Conclusion: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Spectrum-aware analysis reveals inexpensive knobs (low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets) to improve OOD performance before expensive RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

*Tim Langer,Matthias Widra,Volkhard Beyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A TinyML workflow demonstrates a fully embedded process-monitoring classifier for Industry 4.0, achieving 100% accuracy with an 8-bit quantized CNN on a Cortex-M4F and a small memory footprint (~12.6 kB), enabling real-time, low-power wireless monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable smart factory process monitoring with on-device inference to reduce latency, energy consumption, and dependency on external compute while integrating with existing industry 4.0 equipment.

Method: Generate a dataset (MillingVibes), develop and quantize an 8-bit CNN, implement a preprocessing plus classification pipeline, and deploy/evaluate the model on an ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller under a TinyML workflow.

Result: An 8-bit-quantized CNN with 12.59 KiB parameters achieves 100.0% test accuracy, with 15.4 ms inference time and 1.462 mJ per inference on the Cortex-M4F, serving as a reference for TinyML process monitoring.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of full TinyML-based process quality monitoring on resource-constrained devices in Industry 4.0, delivering accurate, fast, and energy-efficient on-device inference and establishing a baseline for future solutions.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart
factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring
systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning
model development, up to implementation and evaluation of a full preprocessing
and classification pipeline on a microcontroller. After a short review on
TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes
dataset is described. The feasibility of a TinyML system for
structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at
15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex

### [123] [Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560)
*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L0 sparsity in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) must be tuned; mis-setting L0 corrupts learned features, with too-low causing feature mixing and too-high causing degenerate solutions. A method to identify the correct L0 aligns with peak sparse probing in LLMs, and many SAEs use an L0 that is too low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAE evaluations treat L0 as a free parameter, but this paper posits that L0 critically shapes learned features. Understanding and correctly setting L0 is essential for faithful feature discovery in LLM activations.

Method: Systematically study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, analyze reconstruction vs sparsity tradeoffs, and develop a method to determine the true L0 for a given training distribution. Validate on toy models and LLMs, showing that the identified L0 coincides with peak sparse probing and that common SAEs underuse L0.

Result: Incorrect L0 leads to mixing of independent features (low L0) or degenerate solutions (high L0); precise L0 recovers true underlying features. A practical method to identify the correct L0 exists and matches peak sparse probing performance in LLMs; many existing SAEs have L0 that is too low.

Conclusion: Correct L0 is essential for SAEs to learn meaningful, separate features from LLM activations; practitioners should determine L0 for the training distribution rather than treating it as arbitrary.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

*Guangyu Sun,Jingtao Li,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedMox enables privacy-aware adaptation of foundation models in a practical semi-supervised federated setting (PSSFL) where edge devices hold unlabeled, low-resolution data and the server holds limited labeled, high-resolution data; uses a sparse Mixture-of-Experts with a spatial router and Soft-Mixture to align resolutions and stabilize learning, improving object detection on autonomous driving data with constrained edge memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models generalize well but require task-specific adaptation; privacy laws block cloud access to edge data, making standard cloud-based fine-tuning infeasible. Federated learning offers privacy-preserving collaboration, but edge devices face limited computation and scarce labeled data, and there is a mismatch in data resolution between edge sensors and server data. The paper targets practical SSL-FL under these constraints (PSSFL).

Method: Introduce Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture with a spatial router that aligns features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. Edge devices operate on unlabeled, low-resolution data while the server uses limited labeled, high-resolution data. Applied to object detection as a case study, with experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrating memory-efficient adaptation.

Result: Empirical results show that FedMox significantly improves FM adaptation under PSSFL under tight edge memory constraints, achieving better object detection performance than baselines on real-world autonomous driving datasets while maintaining feasible on-device memory usage.

Conclusion: FedMox provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach to adapting foundation models in federated settings with resolution and data-label scarcity constraints, addressing computation and data-resolution mismatch and enabling practical FM adaptation in privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

*Anyu Ying,Natarajan Balaji Shankar,Chyi-Jiunn Lin,Mohan Shi,Pu Wang,Hye-jin Shim,Siddhant Arora,Hugo Van hamme,Abeer Alwan,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flat-start training for child speech recognition across datasets, SSL representations, and decoders reduces adult-bias in SSL features and yields gains that scale up to around 1B parameters, with performance plateauing beyond that. The study also finds limitations in proprietary models like Whisper for child speech and argues for open-data models, using ESPnet and releasing a benchmark for robust child speech processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child speech recognition suffers from acoustic variability and scarce annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR models is common, there is limited understanding of flat-start training effectiveness, especially across SSL representations and decoder architectures. The work aims to evaluate flat-start training across datasets and architectures to improve robustness and generalization to child speech.

Method: Systematic comparison of flat-start training across multiple public datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Evaluation includes model scaling studies up to 1B parameters, and age-related ASR and speaker verification analyses. All experiments are conducted using ESPnet, and the authors provide a public benchmark for training strategies in child speech processing.

Result: SSL representations exhibit bias toward adult speech. Flat-start training on child speech reduces these biases. Model scaling yields consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, after which gains plateau. Age-related ASR and speaker verification analyses reveal limitations in proprietary models like Whisper, underscoring the need for open-data models for child speech research. An ESPnet-based framework and a public benchmark are released to guide robust training strategies for child speech processing.

Conclusion: Flat-start training can mitigate adult-bias in SSL-based child ASR and yields scalable gains up to 1B parameters. Open-data models and benchmarks are crucial for advancing reliable child speech research, as reliance on proprietary systems may obscure performance and fairness in child speech tasks.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes T-ILR, a neurosymbolic framework that incorporates temporal logic (LTLf) into deep learning via fuzzy interpretations, extending Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) for sequence tasks; shows improved accuracy and efficiency over the prior method on a temporal neurosymbolic image-sequence benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap of integrating temporal logic specifications into neural models without enumerating explicit finite-state automata; leverage fuzzy LTLf to allow differentiable, scalable temporal reasoning within deep architectures.

Method: Extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm by using fuzzy LTLf interpretations to create Temporal ILR (T-ILR) and embed temporal logic constraints into deep learning models for sequence-based tasks.

Result: Empirical evaluation on a temporal neurosymbolic benchmark (image sequence classification) shows higher accuracy and lower computational cost compared with the existing state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Temporal neurosymbolic architectures with LTLf-guided guidance are effective for sequence learning, offering improved performance and efficiency and suggesting broad applicability in temporally constrained AI tasks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: To address the need for explainable AI in AI-ECG to enable safe integration into clinical practice.

Method: Introduce CoFE framework that generates counterfactual ECGs highlighting how features (amplitudes, intervals) affect predictions; validates with two case studies.

Result: CoFE reveals feature changes that align with established clinical knowledge and clarifies where features appear and how they influence predictions, supporting interpretability.

Conclusion: CoFE has potential to enhance interpretability of AI-ECG models and aid clinical decision-making; a demonstration video is provided.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial

reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

### [128] [MMAPG: A Training-Free Framework for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering via Adaptive Planning Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16051)
*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free Adaptive Planning Graph framework for multimodal multi-hop QA that uses planning, retrieval, and reasoning modules to dynamically explore reasoning paths without task-specific training, achieving competitive results on MultimodalQA and WebQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential, single-path retrieval and reasoning in multimodal QA leads to error compounding and costly training; there is a need for flexible, training-free approaches that can leverage up-to-date models.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Planning Graph with planning, retrieval, and reasoning modules. The planning module selects next actions and where to expand the graph; modality-specific retrieval strategies adapt to text and image data; operation is training-free and can integrate with current models; supports dynamic exploration of multiple reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show the approach matches or outperforms training-based models.

Conclusion: Training-free adaptive planning can effectively leverage multimodal information without task-specific training, offering robust, up-to-date reasoning capabilities and efficient computation.

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach

TL;DR: GDP is a multimodal foundation model for EHRs that integrates structured time-series and unstructured notes, enabling accurate clinical predictions and generation of clinical narratives, with promising clinical utility and extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data are heterogeneous and high-dimensional; preserving temporal and quantitative details is essential. Current methods often serialize data into text, risking loss of temporal fidelity; there is a need for a unified multimodal model that can jointly learn from structured and unstructured EHR data.

Method: GDP uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to natively encode structured EHR time-series and fuses it with unstructured EHRs via cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. Training occurs in two stages: (1) generative pretraining to produce clinical narratives from raw timelines, plus masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission).

Result: On MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC 0.817, 30-day readmission AUROC 0.627. Narrative generation: ROUGE-L 0.135, BERTScore-F1 0.545. Blind human evaluation favored GDP-Instruct for faithfulness, fluency, and clinical utility.

Conclusion: A single multimodal foundation model can simultaneously predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives, with a flexible architecture that can extend to additional modalities.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

*Sijie Yang,Binyu Lei,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conceptual study that clarifies what urban comfort means and presents a three-dimensional framework—multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI-assisted tools—for evaluating comfort in digital urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban liveability and comfort are central to planning, yet there is no universally accepted definition or evaluation framework. Although many studies quantify greenery, thermal comfort, and walkability, practitioners lack an integrated approach. This work motivates a theoretical grounding and actionable guidance for digital planning.

Method: The authors perform a theoretical interpretation and methodological synthesis from existing literature, developing a framework centered on three dimensions and outlining how data, metrics, and AI tools can support assessment in practice.

Result: Clarifies urban comfort definitions and proposes an evaluative framework with three guiding dimensions. Provides criteria for data quality, metrics, and AI-enabled decision support, plus a research agenda for operationalization.

Conclusion: The framework has potential to standardize urban comfort assessment in digital planning, enabling more informed decisions. Future work should validate the framework in real-world contexts and develop concrete metrics and toolchains.

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:
multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance.

### [131] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSEF enables LLMs to access time-series patterns at all depths by fusing TS embeddings into intermediate layers using layer-specific steering vectors, improving TS forecasting performance in few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-TSF methods inject TS information only at shallow layers, causing loss of TS signals in deeper layers and misalignment between textual and TS representations; this limits effective adaptation and few-shot learning.

Method: Use off-the-shelf TS foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings and fuse them with intermediate LLM text representations across layers via layer-specific steering vectors that continuously optimize TS-text alignment and enable layer-wise adaptation.

Result: On seven benchmarks, MSEF achieves significant gains, with an average reduction of 31.8% in MSE compared with baselines; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: MSEF addresses progressive loss of TS information in deeper LLM layers by enabling multi-layer, steerable fusion of TS embeddings, yielding strong empirical improvements in TS forecasting with LLMs.

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

*Zizhen Li,Chuanhao Li,Yibin Wang,Qi Chen,Diping Song,Yukang Feng,Jianwen Sun,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Mingzhu Sun,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InMind provides a cognitively grounded framework to evaluate personalized reasoning styles in social deduction games (SDGs); findings show most LLMs rely on lexical cues and struggle to anchor reflections to gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies, while some reasoning-enhanced models exhibit early style-sensitive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture individualized reasoning styles in social contexts—an aspect largely ignored by prior LLM evaluations that focus on intentions or deception, thus needing a framework to assess static alignment and dynamic adaptation in SDGs.

Method: Augments SDG gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under Observer and Participant modes; supports four cognitively motivated tasks to evaluate static and dynamic alignment; case study Avalon with 11 LLMs; compares general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) with reasoning-enhanced LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1).

Result: General-purpose LLMs rely on lexical cues and fail to anchor reflections to temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies; some reasoning-enhanced LLMs show early signs of style-sensitive reasoning.

Conclusion: InMind is a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction, highlighting current limitations in individualized adaptive reasoning and providing a framework for evaluating and advancing such capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

*Heewoong Noh,Namkyeong Lee,Gyoung S. Na,Kibum Kim,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IR-Agent is a multi-agent framework that mimics expert IR analysis to elucidate molecular structures from infrared spectra; it is extensible and improves accuracy by coordinating specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared spectroscopy is accessible and cheap, but current methods struggle to incorporate expert reasoning and diverse chemical knowledge; a modular, agent-based approach can reflect expert workflows and be easily extended.

Method: Develop a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in a facet of IR interpretation; designed to emulate expert-driven analysis, enabling integrated reasoning. The architecture supports extensibility to include different chemical knowledge types. Extensive experiments on experimental IR spectra compare to baselines and test adaptability to various chemical information forms.

Result: IR-Agent improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra and demonstrates strong adaptability to different types of chemical information.

Conclusion: A flexible, extensible framework that mimics expert IR analysis can enhance molecular structure elucidation from IR spectra and accommodate diverse chemical knowledge representations, with potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

*Saransh Kumar Gupta,Rizwan Gulzar Mir,Lipika Dey,Partha Pratim Das,Anirban Sen,Ramesh Jain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) as an extension of the Indian food knowledge graph FKG.in, enabling traceable, provenance-aware validation of food-related claims using ontology design and semi-automated curation with Reddit data and LLMs; demonstrated via a proof-of-concept and is adaptable to other settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The global food landscape is flooded with diverse, sometimes conflicting, claims about foods and their effects. The existing infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims is fragmented and underdeveloped, hindering transparency and accountability for researchers, policymakers, and consumers.

Method: Design an ontology for FCN, develop a semi-automated knowledge curation workflow, and implement a proof-of-concept extension of FKG.in (FKG.in-FCN) that ingests Reddit data and uses Large Language Models to extract, validate, and provenance-tag food claims; create provenance-aware pipelines and structured schemas; application-agnostic framework.

Result: A proof-of-concept implementation (FKG.in-FCN) that integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food-claim extraction and validation, demonstrated in the Indian food domain; shows feasibility and adaptability but not a full deployment.

Conclusion: The methodology remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or regulatory contexts, with the aim of enabling more transparent, accountable food knowledge ecosystems to assist researchers, policymakers, and everyday consumers.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IVA is a unified Vision-Language-Action framework that detects false-premise instructions, clarifies or corrects via language, and grounds viable alternatives in perception and action. It is trained on a contextually augmented semi-synthetic dataset with paired true/false premises, achieving strong gains in false-premise handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how vision-language-action models handle instructions that reference absent or impossible objects/conditions, ensuring safe and robust behavior when requests cannot be fulfilled.

Method: Propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA) with three stages: detect false premises, request clarification or correction in natural language, and ground plausible alternatives through perception and action. Build a large, instruction-tuning pipeline using structured language prompts and a semi-synthetic dataset of paired positive and false-premise instructions to train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests.

Result: IVA yields a 97.56% improvement in false premise detection accuracy over baselines and a 50.78% increase in successful responses in false-premise scenarios.

Conclusion: IVA demonstrates that integrated verification, language-based clarification, and grounding can robustly handle false-premise instructions, enhancing reliability and safety of VLA systems in real-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

*Ruiqi Wu,Yuang Yao,Tengfei Ma,Chenran Zhang,Na Su,Tao Zhou,Geng Chen,Wen Fan,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MM-Retinal-Reason: an ophthalmic multimodal dataset with perception and reasoning; OphthaReason: a reasoning model with uncertainty-aware dynamic thinking, achieving state-of-the-art results on basic and complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to perform realistic clinical reasoning in ophthalmology, where diagnosis requires integrating heterogeneous information (e.g., chief complaints, medical history) with multimodal imaging. There is a need for an ophthalmology-specific dataset with full perception-to-reasoning capability and a model that can provide step-by-step reasoning traces.

Method: Introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, a first ophthalmic multimodal dataset spanning basic and complex reasoning tasks to emulate clinical thinking. Develop OphthaReason, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces, powered by Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) that estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and modulates exploration depth with a shaped advantage mechanism.

Result: OphthaReason achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92%, 15.00%, 21.20%, and 17.66%. A project page is available.

Conclusion: This work fills a critical gap in ophthalmology AI by providing a dedicated multimodal dataset and a reasoning model with uncertainty-aware dynamic thinking and traceable reasoning, enabling more realistic clinical decision support and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Preference Chain, a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines LLMs with graph-based context retrieval to simulate human mobility behavior in urban settings. Demonstrates improved alignment with real-world mode choices on the Replica dataset, and discusses applications and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for context-aware, realistic, and data-efficient behavioral simulations in urban environments, especially in new or data-scarce areas where traditional data-driven models struggle. LLM-based simulators often lack consistency and relevance to current context.

Method: Develops the Preference Chain by integrating Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models to supply structured, context-relevant information to the model. Trains/validates on the Replica dataset and evaluates against real transportation mode choices. Introduces Mobility Agent as an application of the method for urban mobility modeling.

Result: The Preference Chain outperforms standard LLMs in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices on the Replica dataset, indicating improved context-aware and behavior-consistent outputs. The approach enables applications in emerging cities and personalized travel analysis. Limitations include slow inference and the risk of hallucinations.

Conclusion: The proposed Preference Chain offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, with potential applications in urban mobility modeling, personalized travel analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting, while acknowledging computational costs and hallucination risks.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

TL;DR: M2N2 introduces dynamic merging boundaries, diversity preservation, and an attraction-based selection heuristic to evolve and merge neural models, enabling from-scratch evolution and scalable performance comparable to CMA-ES.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed, manually partitioned parameter groups in model merging, which restrict exploration of combinations and potential performance.

Method: An evolutionary algorithm with three components: (1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to explore a broad space of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by natural resource competition to maintain a diverse pool of high-performing models for merging; (3) a heuristic attraction metric to identify promising model pairs for fusion.

Result: Demonstrates, for the first time, that model merging can evolve models from scratch (e.g., MNIST classifiers) with performance comparable to CMA-ES but more computationally efficient; scales to merge specialized language and image-generation models achieving state-of-the-art performance; preserves crucial capabilities not explicitly optimized by fitness; code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: M2N2 is robust and versatile, enabling effective model merging across domains, including from-scratch evolution, and opens avenues for broader application and further optimization in model integration.

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend AI evaluation beyond task performance to measure maturation and ethical, psychological, and social dimensions; answer 'Can machines grow up?' as a successor to the Turing Test.

Method: Six criteria (C1-C6) are evaluated via designated games across four arenas that compare human dimensions with their AI counterparts. All decisions/actions are logged in a standardized AI Journal. Weights set by prior expert method; Grow Up Index is the arithmetic mean of six scores; maturity thresholds guide interpretation; structure supports cross-domain comparability and traceability.

Result: Demonstrates that the framework yields coherent and comparable assessments of AI 'growth' regardless of type (robots, software agents, LLMs); identifies strengths and vulnerabilities; the AI Journal ensures traceability and replicability across evaluations.

Conclusion: Original contribution lies in translating human growth processes into AI evaluation within an integrated multi-game format, combining psychology, robotics, CS, and ethics; GROW-AI aims to measure not only performance but the evolutionary path toward maturity in AI entities.

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentScope 1.0 provides a comprehensive, scalable infrastructure for tool-based agents, including unified interfaces, asynchronous agent infrastructure, built-in scenario-specific agents, sandboxing, scalable evaluation with a visual interface, and production deployment support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As large language models empower agents to integrate intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tools, there is a need for a unified, extensible, and safe framework to support flexible agent–environment interactions and scalable development/deployment of agentic applications.

Method: Abstract foundational components and provide unified interfaces and extensible modules; ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm; adopt a systematic asynchronous design; integrate built-in agents for practical scenarios; offer developer-friendly engineering support; include a scalable evaluation module with a visual interface; provide a runtime sandbox for safe execution and rapid production deployment.

Result: Establishes a practical foundation for scalable, adaptive, and effective agentic applications, improves interaction patterns (human–agent and agent–agent), enhances execution efficiency, eases development and tracing, and enables safe, rapid deployment in production environments.

Conclusion: AgentScope 1.0 offers a pragmatic, end-to-end platform that aligns with rapid LLM-driven advancements and lowers the barrier to building scalable, real-world agentic systems.

Abstract: Driven by rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), agents are
empowered to combine intrinsic knowledge with dynamic tool use, greatly
enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and
provide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to
easily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,
we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A causally-aware DL framework uses causal discovery to identify a minimal, causally relevant feature set for beam prediction, reducing overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based beam alignment often ignores causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading to poor interpretability, limited generalization, and high beam sweeping overhead in mmWave MIMO systems for 6G+, especially under real-world uncertainty.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) apply causal discovery to learn a Bayesian graph linking received power inputs to the optimal beam; (2) use the graph to perform causal feature selection and train a DL classifier on the selected features, reducing input dimensionality and overhead.

Result: Simulations show that causal beam selection matches conventional methods in performance while reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing on causally relevant features.

Conclusion: Causally-aware DL for beam management improves efficiency and interpretability, enabling faster, more robust beam alignment with less overhead; the approach has potential for generalization to real-world uncertainties.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

*Xinyu Yang,Chenlong Deng,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GLARE is an agentic legal reasoning framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge via modular reasoning to improve legal judgment prediction, with experimental validation and an interpretable reasoning chain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models (LLMs) exhibit insufficient legal reasoning due to gaps in legal knowledge, hindering performance in legal judgment prediction and interpretability.

Method: GLARE uses an agentic reasoning framework that dynamically invokes different modules to acquire and apply essential legal knowledge during the reasoning process, enhancing both breadth and depth of analysis; evaluated on a real-world dataset with analysis traces.

Result: Experiments on a real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of GLARE; the generated reasoning chain also increases interpretability and enables practical applications.

Conclusion: GLARE offers a path to more capable and transparent LJP systems by integrating dynamic knowledge acquisition with agentic reasoning.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the
legal field. In this paper, we identify that existing large language models
(LLMs) have significant problems of insufficient reasoning due to a lack of
legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning
framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different
modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments
conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can
increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoDER proposes modular textual experts per seen class for Vision-Language Models and composes them at inference to form refined prototypes for unseen classes, boosting zero-shot continual learning on Class-IL and MTIL across 14 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Vision-Language Models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities, continual learning on downstream tasks still requires some fine-tuning. Prior work primarily aims to preserve zero-shot ability during incremental fine-tuning; this work seeks to enhance zero-shot performance by modularly augmenting the model's representations, enabling better generalization to unseen classes.

Method: Train multiple textual experts, each specialized to a single seen class, stored in a foundational hub. At inference, retrieve and compose the relevant experts for an unseen class to synthesize a refined prototype for classification. Evaluated under Class-IL and MTIL protocols across 14 datasets; code released at the provided GitHub URL.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness of MoDER across two zero-shot incremental protocols (Class-IL and MTIL) on a total of 14 datasets; showcases improved handling of unseen classes in continual learning; code available at the cited repository.

Conclusion: A modular embedding recomposition framework can transform preservation of zero-shot capabilities into an enhancement, enabling scalable, flexible improvement of zero-shot classification for unseen classes in continual learning.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

*Xuan Zhang,Zhijian Zhou,Weidi Xu,Yanting Miao,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diffusion-based two-stage neuro-symbolic framework with IPPO-based hard-constraint fine-tuning achieves high accuracy and logical consistency on symbolic reasoning benchmarks like Sudoku, Maze, and pathfinding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often struggle to satisfy complex symbolic constraints; guiding neural outputs toward logical consistency is essential for symbolic reasoning tasks. Diffusion models offer a flexible architecture to integrate such constraints and enable structured reasoning.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) cultivate basic reasoning abilities; (2) learn and enforce logical constraints. In stage 2, the diffusion reasoner is formulated as a Markov decision process and fine-tuned with an improved proximal policy optimization (IPPO). A rule-based reward signal derived from logical consistency guides learning, with a flexible strategy to optimize the diffusion policy.

Result: The approach achieves outstanding accuracy and strong logical consistency across classical symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding, and preference learning.

Conclusion: A diffusion-based neuro-symbolic pipeline can effectively enforce hard logical constraints in neural outputs, demonstrating strong performance in symbolic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

### [145] [LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571)
*Alisa Vinogradova,Vlad Vinogradov,Dmitrii Radkevich,Ilya Yasny,Dmitry Kobyzev,Ivan Izmailov,Katsiaryna Yanchanka,Andrey Doronichev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Competitor-discovery AI agent for drug asset diligence, with a private benchmark and a judging LLM to suppress hallucinations, achieving 83% recall and ~20x faster analyst turnaround.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise bottleneck: fragmented, paywalled drug data; no public benchmark; LLMs struggle to retrieve complete competitor lists; need faster, precise due diligence.

Method: Developed a competitor-discovery agent to fetch competitive landscape and extract canonical attributes; created a benchmark by converting five years of diligence memos into a structured corpus mapping indications to drugs; introduced a judge agent to filter false positives; deployed in production.

Result: Achieves 83% recall on benchmark, higher than OpenAI Deep Research 65% and Perplexity Labs 60%; production deployment with ~20x reduction in analyst turnaround time (2.5 days to ~3 hours) in a biotech VC setting.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective enterprise-grade competitor discovery for drug diligence, enabling rapid, precise competitive analyses; highlights need for proprietary datasets and ongoing benchmarking; potential to scale with more data and generalize to other indications.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

### [146] [Characterizing and Recognizing Twistedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16178)
*Oswin Aichholzer,Alfredo García,Javier Tejel,Birgit Vogtenhuber,Alexandra Weinberger*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A combinatorial, local-to-global characterization for generalized twisted drawings of K_n with efficient recognition. For n>=7, a rotation system is generalized twisted iff all five-vertex subrotation systems are; yields O(n^5) recognition, and, for realizable systems, an O(n^2) algorithm via pair-vertex rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain a purely combinatorial, drawing-independent understanding of generalized twisted drawings and to enable efficient recognition algorithms, given their importance in extremal plane substructures and structural graph drawing properties.

Method: Prove a local-to-global criterion: generalized twistedness of K_n is determined by all 5-vertex subrotation systems. Develop a rotation-based characterization, including the rotations at a pair of vertices, to derive two algorithms: an O(n^5) check over all 5-vertex subsystems and an O(n^2) check specialized to realizable rotation systems.

Result: Equivalence: for any n≥7, an abstract rotation system of K_n is generalized twisted iff every subrotation system on five vertices is generalized twisted. Consequently, a drawing-independent characterization is obtained and an O(n^5) algorithm to decide generalized twistedness is produced. Additionally, a rotation-pair-based characterization yields an O(n^2) algorithm for realizable rotation systems.

Conclusion: This yields a purely combinatorial handle on generalized twisted drawings, enabling efficient recognition and shedding light on the structural features of simple drawings; it may facilitate extensions to other drawing properties and larger combinatorial classes.

Abstract: In a simple drawing of a graph, any two edges intersect in at most one point
(either a common endpoint or a proper crossing). A simple drawing is
generalized twisted if it fulfills certain rather specific constraints on how
the edges are drawn. An abstract rotation system of a graph assigns to each
vertex a cyclic order of its incident edges. A realizable rotation system is
one that admits a simple drawing such that at each vertex, the edges emanate in
that cyclic order, and a generalized twisted rotation system can be realized as
a generalized twisted drawing. Generalized twisted drawings have initially been
introduced to obtain improved bounds on the size of plane substructures in any
simple drawing of $K_n$. They have since gained independent interest due to
their surprising properties. However, the definition of generalized twisted
drawings is very geometric and drawing-specific.
  In this paper, we develop characterizations of generalized twisted drawings
that enable a purely combinatorial view on these drawings and lead to efficient
recognition algorithms. Concretely, we show that for any $n \geq 7$, an
abstract rotation system of $K_n$ is generalized twisted if and only if all
subrotation systems induced by five vertices are generalized twisted. This
implies a drawing-independent and concise characterization of generalized
twistedness. Besides, the result yields a simple $O(n^5)$-time algorithm to
decide whether an abstract rotation system is generalized twisted and sheds new
light on the structural features of simple drawings. We further develop a
characterization via the rotations of a pair of vertices in a drawing, which we
then use to derive an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to decide whether a realizable
rotation system is generalized twisted.

*Badhan Mazumder,Aline Kotoski,Vince D. Calhoun,Dong Hye Ye*

TL;DR: NeuroKoop uses Koopman-operator-based latent space fusion to integrate SBM and FNC graphs in a GNN, improving PDE status classification in adolescents using ABCD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal brain data (structure and function) capture complementary information; existing methods fail to fully leverage this, limiting biological insight and predictive power for prenatal drug exposure.

Method: A graph neural network framework NeuroKoop that fuses node embeddings from source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) through a neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion; applied to ABCD adolescent cohort for PDE classification.

Result: Outperformed relevant baselines; identified salient structural-functional connections; demonstrated enhanced representation learning and predictive performance.

Conclusion: Koopman-based latent fusion across structural and functional connectomes offers a powerful approach to understand prenatal substance exposure effects on brain development and can improve predictive modeling in neurodevelopmental studies.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.
