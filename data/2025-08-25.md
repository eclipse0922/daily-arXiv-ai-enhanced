### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Train HandMDM, a text-conditioned 3D hand-motion diffusion model, by pairing large-scale sign-language video data with LLM-generated textual descriptions; achieves cross-domain generalization to unseen signs and non-sign motions; releasing models and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, language-conditioned generation of 3D hand motions by leveraging abundant sign-language video data and LLM-driven labeling, addressing data scarcity and cross-domain generalization.

Method: Construct a large dataset of 3D hand motions and textual labels by translating noisy pseudo-annotations from sign-language videos into hand-motion descriptions via an LLM using a dictionary of sign attributes and motion-script cues; train HandMDM, a text-conditioned hand-motion diffusion model; evaluate robustness across unseen signs within the same sign language, signs from another sign language, and non-sign hand movements; plan public release of models and data.

Result: The approach yields a model robust across domains (unseen sign categories within the same language, cross-language signs, and non-sign movements) and is validated through extensive experiments; the authors will publicly release their trained models and data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability of scaling hand-motion learning through language supervision derived from large-scale sign-language data, enabling cross-domain generalization and accelerating progress in this nascent field.

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VT-LVLM-AR, a Video-Temporal LVLM adapter that converts video into visual event sequences via VTEM and classifies actions using a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model with Prompt Tuning v2, achieving SOTA on NTU RGB+D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term, complex action recognition struggles with computational cost, long-range dependencies, and limited semantics; LVLMs offer multi-modal reasoning but need bridging to continuous video.

Method: Introduce VT-LVLM-AR: Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) for compact, semantically rich event sequences via lightweight spatio-temporal features, adaptive temporal pooling, and event coherence bias; an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module using frozen LLaVA-1.5 adapted with Prompt Tuning v2 for action classification.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub); ablations confirm VTEM components and Prompt Tuning efficacy; human evaluations indicate interpretability of visual event representations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of leveraging LVLMs for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT introduces a vision-language pathology framework that uses spatially-aware visual aggregation and prompt tuning to convert WSI-level labels into tile-level guidance, enabling cross-modal reasoning and improved rare cancer subtyping with better localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare cancers are hard to diagnose due to limited expert availability, especially in pediatric oncology. Vision-language foundation models show zero-shot potential for common cancers but struggle on rare types; conventional MIL relies only on visual features and lacks interpretability. There is a need to integrate cross-modal knowledge and localization for rare cancer diagnosis.

Method: PathPT leverages vision-language pathology foundation models with spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning. It converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by exploiting zero-shot capabilities of VL models, enabling localization on cancerous regions and cross-modal reasoning through histopathology-aligned prompts. Evaluations benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets (four adult, four pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, plus three common cancer datasets, across four VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings.

Result: PathPT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous-region grounding across rare and common cancer datasets, demonstrating effective cross-modal reasoning and localization in a few-shot regime.

Conclusion: PathPT advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers, offering a scalable approach that improves subtyping accuracy and localization when expert availability is limited.

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

*Jiahao Li,Jiancheng Pan,Yuze Sun,Xiaomeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-language based SASD framework using a multi-scale adaptive sliding window, with a new ShipSem-VL dataset; evaluated on three tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote-sensing ship detection methods struggle to capture fine-grained semantic information in complex scenes, hindering robust detection.

Method: Proposes a framework that combines Vision-Language Models with a multi-scale adaptive sliding window; introduces ShipSem-VL, a dataset for fine-grained ship attributes; evaluates on three tasks.

Result: Three-task evaluation indicates the approach is effective and improves semantic-aware ship detection across scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework advances semantic-aware ship detection (SASD) and provides a dataset to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

### [5] [Automatic Retrieval of Specific Cows from Unlabeled Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15945)
*Jiawen Lyu,Manu Ramesh,Madison Simonds,Jacquelyn P. Boerman,Amy R. Reibman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-component system (AutoCataloger, eidetic recognizer, and CowFinder) for hands-free cataloging and identification of dairy cows from video, using non-deep-learning methods; demonstrated on unlabeled, unsegmented herd videos in a milking-parlor setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of open literature on automated hands-free cow cataloging/ID, enable scalable, hands-free identification in dairy herds, and reduce manual labeling by leveraging video data.

Method: AutoCataloger builds a catalog (Cattlog) from a single input video clip per cow; an eidetic cow recognizer uses non-deep-learning techniques to ID cows; CowFinder identifies cows in a continuous video stream. Demonstrated on cows walking unconstrained through the milking parlor holding area.

Result: Demonstrates the system's ability to locate and identify individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented video sequences of cows in a real-world setting.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for scalable, hands-free cow cataloging and identification in dairy operations, achieving ID and retrieval without reliance on deep learning, and handling continuous video data.

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

### [6] [Investigating Different Geo Priors for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15946)
*Angela Zhu,Christian Lange,Max Hamilton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SINR models evaluated as geographical priors for iNaturalist species classification; analyzes model configurations and handling of unseen species; identifies factors driving Geo Priors' effectiveness, distinct from range-map accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve vision-based species classification by incorporating spatial priors via species distribution models; assess whether Spatial Implicit Neural Representations can serve as effective Geo Priors and how they differ from traditional range maps; address predictions for species absent from Geo Prior training.

Method: Systematically evaluate multiple SINR configurations as geographic priors using iNaturalist observations; experiment with different model settings; implement strategies for predictions for species not in Geo Prior training; analyze factors affecting performance.

Result: Certain factors significantly influence the effectiveness of SINR-based Geo Priors; some key factors differ from those driving accurate range maps; SINR priors can improveGeo-based classification when location information is available.

Conclusion: SINR-based Geographical Priors present a viable approach for vision-based species classification, with caveats around unseen species and the need for careful configuration; their success is not solely determined by traditional range-map accuracy.

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Superpixel Coding (ASC) introduces a self-supervised Transformer model that uses dynamic, content-driven superpixel partitions instead of fixed-size patches, improving performance on standard image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers rely on fixed grid patches, which are not adaptive to image content and can limit modeling flexibility. There is a need for self-supervised, content-aware representations that better capture local structure without handcrafted priors.

Method: Propose ASC with adaptive superpixel layers that dynamically adjust partitioning to image content. Trains the model in a self-supervised fashion and analyzes key properties that lead to effectiveness.

Result: ASC outperforms widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: Adaptive, content-driven superpixel partitioning for Transformers enhances vision models, addressing fixed-patch limitations and yielding stronger performance on common benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

### [8] [Glo-VLMs: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Diseased Glomerulus Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15960)
*Zhenhao Guo,Rachit Saluja,Tianyuan Yao,Quan Liu,Yuankai Huo,Benjamin Liechty,David J. Pisapia,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Few-shot adaptation of vision-language models for fine-grained glomerular subtyping via Glo-VLMs; achieves competitive metrics with 8-shot per class, highlighting the viability of foundation models in renal pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing glomerular subtypes is challenged by subtle morphological differences and the mismatch between visual patterns and clinical terminology; large pretrained VLMs may require adaptation to perform precise, disease-specific renal pathology classification under limited labeled data.

Method: Introduce Glo-VLMs, a framework for adapting VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification using curated pathology images and clinical text prompts to learn joint image-text representations. Systematically evaluates multiple VLM architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot paradigm with standardized multi-class metrics.

Result: With 8 shots per class, achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score, indicating effective adaptation of foundation models for fine-grained medical image classification in data-constrained settings.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning or adapting VLMs can enable robust, fine-grained renal pathology classification even with limited supervision; results clarify practical data requirements and demonstrate potential for clinical research applications in specialized pathology tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

*Floris Erich,Naoya Chiba,Abdullah Mustafa,Ryo Hanai,Noriaki Ando,Yusuke Yoshiyasu,Yukiyasu Domae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated 3D object reconstruction from multiple videos using a fiducial marker to initialize a known point in frames and SfM to place frames in world space, merging results to produce a complete object mesh without hole filling; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable complete geometric models of everyday objects without commercial scanners by leveraging consumer markers and multi-view geometry.

Method: Provide one known point per video frame via fiducial markers; compute camera poses and frame positions using Structure-from-Motion; merge meshes from multiple videos to form a complete object mesh, eliminating the need for hole filling.

Result: Demonstrates generation of a complete object mesh by merging multi-video SfM outputs; code released (GitHub).

Conclusion: Marker-assisted multi-view SfM can produce complete object meshes from consumer videos, offering a practical pipeline without hole filling and with accessible code.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from
https://github.com/FlorisE/NeuralMeshing.

### [10] [Contributions to Label-Efficient Learning in Computer Vision and Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15973)
*Minh-Tan Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey-style manuscript that consolidates label-efficient learning efforts in computer vision and remote sensing, organized around four axes: (1) weakly supervised anomaly-aware object discovery/detection; (2) multi-task learning across datasets with disjoint annotations; (3) self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data for remote sensing scene classification; (4) few-shot hierarchical scene classification. Demonstrates methodological developments and domain adaptations with extensive experiments on natural and RS datasets, and discusses future scaling for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of labeling and the abundance of unlabeled data, especially in Earth observation, where data are multi-modal, vary in spatial resolution, and exhibit scene heterogeneity. The goal is to advance label-efficient learning that can generalize across diverse RS tasks and data sources.

Method: Introduce and analyze four axes of label-efficient learning: (1) weakly supervised learning employing anomaly-aware representations learned from large pools of background images for object discovery/detection; (2) multi-task learning across datasets with disjoint annotations to improve object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance remote sensing scene classification; (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification with explicit and implicit hierarchy modeling. Emphasizes methodological contributions and domain-specific adaptations with cross-domain validation across natural and RS datasets.

Result: Extensive experimental validation across natural and remote sensing datasets demonstrates effectiveness of the proposed label-efficient strategies. The approaches yield improvements in weakly supervised object discovery/detection, cross-dataset gains via multi-task learning, enhanced scene classification through multimodal self-supervised/contrastive learning, and better performance in few-shot hierarchical classification.

Conclusion: The manuscript argues for continued scaling and refinement of label-efficient learning methods for real-world applications, outlining future directions for broader data scalability, multimodal integration, and deployment-ready techniques in CV and RS contexts.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

### [11] [Panoptic Segmentation of Environmental UAV Images : Litter Beach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15985)
*Ousmane Youme,Jean Marie Dembélé,Eugene C. Ezin,Christophe Cambier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based segmentation methods can effectively detect marine litter in UAV imagery using few labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine litter is a global environmental challenge and UAVs provide high-resolution, locally adaptable imagery. Plain CNNs can struggle on heterogeneous sand due to reflections, shadows, and textures, prompting the use of segmentation-based approaches.

Method: Employ instance-based segmentation and panoptic segmentation on UAV imagery for marine litter, aiming to achieve good accuracy with a small number of labeled samples.

Result: The instance-based and panoptic segmentation methods demonstrate good accuracy with only a few labeled samples, indicating robustness in cluttered, sandy environments.

Conclusion: Segmentation-based approaches offer a robust, data-efficient solution for marine litter monitoring in UAV imagery, suitable for scenarios with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

### [12] [HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465)
*Anilkumar Swamy,Vincent Leroy,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Jean-Sébastien Franco,Grégory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOSt3R: a keypoint detector-free monocular hand-object 3D transformation estimation method that integrates with multi-view reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art on SHOWMe and generalizing to unseen objects on HO3D without templates or known intrinsics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, scalable, and non-intrusive hand-object 3D reconstruction for HRI and AR/VR, addressing the limitations of keypoint-based SfM and hand-keypoint optimization under diverse/object geometries, textures, and occlusions.

Method: A keypoint-detector-free approach that estimates hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images, integrated into a multi-view reconstruction pipeline (HOSt3R). It is unconstrained, requires no pre-scanned templates or camera intrinsics, and is object-agnostic.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark; demonstrates generalization to unseen object categories on HO3D sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed HOSt3R framework provides a robust, unconstrained, and generalizable solution for hand-object 3D reconstruction from monocular data, enabling accurate 3D transformations and shape estimation without relying on predefined templates or camera parameters.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

*Jerry Cao-Xue,Tien Comlekoglu,Keyi Xue,Guanliang Wang,Jiang Li,Gordon Laurie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic SynFundus-1M enables strong multi-label retinal disease classification; six architectures plus a stacking ensemble achieve near-perfect internal performance and good generalization to real datasets, establishing a baseline for synthetic-data driven ophthalmology models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity and privacy barriers of large annotated retinal datasets; assess whether synthetic data can enable generalizable models for multi-disease classification.

Method: Train six architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound) on SynFundus-1M with 11 disease labels using 5-fold multi-label stratified cross-validation; build meta-ensemble by stacking out-of-fold predictions with XGBoost; evaluate on internal and three real datasets (DR, AIROGS glaucoma, RFMiD).

Result: Internal macro-AUC 0.9973; generalization: DR dataset AUC 0.7972, AIROGS glaucoma 0.9126, RFMiD macro-AUC 0.8800.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can train models that generalize to real clinical images and provide a robust baseline; synthetic datasets can accelerate development of comprehensive ophthalmology AI systems.

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based SLP pipeline with a sign feature aggregation module delivers diverse, photorealistic sign avatars while preserving linguistic content, achieving superior perceptual quality over SOTA on YouTube-SL-25.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the diversity gap in sign representation and the challenge of modeling non-manual attributes (facial expressions, emotions) without sacrificing visual quality; current SLP models struggle to capture diversity across appearances.

Method: Uses Latent Diffusion Model to synthesize photorealistic avatars from a generated reference image. Introduces a sign feature aggregation module that separately models non-manual (face) and manual (hands) features, enabling diversity via reference images with different ethnic backgrounds while preserving linguistic content.

Result: The pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics on the YouTube-SL-25 dataset.

Conclusion: The approach enables diverse, high-quality sign language avatars that preserve linguistic content, leveraging explicit modeling of non-manual cues and diffusion-based generation; supports broader diversity in SLP and sets a new benchmark on perceptual quality.

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

*Aykut Sirma,Angelos Plastropoulos,Argyrios Zolotas,Gilbert Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRespNeT: a high-resolution aerial dataset for post-earthquake instance segmentation with 28 classes, enabling real-time YOLOv8-seg-based SAR support (92.7% mAP50 at 27 FPS on RTX-4090).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a gap in fine-grained, real-time perception of post-disaster urban environments by providing polygon-level annotations from 1080p UAV imagery, enabling better entry-point identification and obstacle avoidance for SAR operations.

Method: Create DRespNeT with 1080p aerial footage from disaster zones (e.g., 2023 Turkiye earthquake), annotate 28 classes at polygon-level, and optimize YOLOv8-seg (YOLOv8-DRN) for multi-target detection; evaluate performance (mAP50, FPS).

Result: Achieves 92.7% mAP50 with 27 FPS on an RTX-4090 for multi-target detection, demonstrating real-time capabilities and improved situational awareness for SAR teams and robotic systems.

Conclusion: DRespNeT and the optimized YOLOv8-DRN model provide a solid foundation for enhanced human-robot collaboration and faster, more informed disaster response, with potential extensions to hardware generalization and broader disaster scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

*Jinyue Song,Hansol Ku,Jayneel Vora,Nelson Lee,Ahmad Kamari,Prasant Mohapatra,Parth Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset CoVeRaP with 21k frames for cooperative FMCW radar perception, plus a multi-branch fusion network that improves 3D detection, establishing the first reproducible multi-vehicle radar benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse, noisy radar point clouds limit autonomous perception; sharing radar data across vehicles and time-aligned multimodal streams (radar, camera, GPS) can boost detection robustness in adverse conditions.

Method: A unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and late-fusion; a multi-branch PointNet-style encoder with self-attention fuses spatial, Doppler, and intensity into a shared latent space; a decoder outputs 3D bounding boxes and per-point depth confidence; time-aligned data across radar, camera, and GPS from multiple vehicles.

Result: Middle fusion with intensity encoding yields up to 9x improvement in mean Average Precision at IoU 0.9 and outperforms single-vehicle baselines across experiments.

Conclusion: CoVeRaP provides the first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and shows that affordable radar sharing significantly improves detection robustness; dataset and code are publicly available to foster further research.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [17] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM enhances anomaly detection/localization by using wavelet-based feature selection on multi-layer CNN features to replace random channel selection in PaDiM, enabling multi-scale, frequency-aware modeling of normal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In PaDiM, random channel selection may discard structured, frequency-specific information essential for detecting subtle industrial anomalies. A principled method to select and fuse features across scales and frequencies could improve detection and localization.

Method: Apply 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, select frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL, HH), spatially align them, and concatenate them channel-wise. Then model the resulting multivariate feature distribution with PaDiM's Gaussian framework.

Result: On MVTec AD with backbones like ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0–B6, WE-PaDiM achieves strong performance: average Image-AUC 99.32% and Pixel-AUC 92.10% across 15 categories with per-class optimized configurations. Wavelet choice influences trade-offs: Haar wavelets with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH) tend to improve localization, while LL (approximation) bands improve image-level detection.

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM provides a competitive, interpretable alternative to random feature selection in PaDiM, delivering robust anomaly detection and localization suitable for industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

### [18] [Expandable Residual Approximation for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16050)
*Zhaoyi Yan,Binghui Chen,Yunfan Liu,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERA (Expandable Residual Approximation) for knowledge distillation decomposes residual knowledge into multiple steps via a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet), and uses a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy to reuse the teacher head. This approach narrows the teacher–student capacity gap and yields consistent gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The teacher–student learning capacity gap often limits effective knowledge transfer in KD. Inspired by the progressive approximation principle (Stone-Weierstrass theorem), ERA aims to ease knowledge transfer by breaking down residuals across multiple steps.

Method: Introduce a Multi-Branched Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement residual knowledge decomposition. Apply a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy to mitigate capacity disparity by reusing teacher head weights. Train the student under the ERA framework.

Result: On ImageNet, Top-1 accuracy improves by 1.41%. On MS COCO, AP improves by 1.40. ERA achieves leading performance across CV tasks.

Conclusion: ERA demonstrates that decomposing residual knowledge and reusing teacher components can effectively bridge teacher–student gaps in KD, yielding consistent performance gains across vision tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of deep-learning based non-intrusive 3D animal reconstruction from RGB data, organizing methods by input, geometry/motion representations, and training strategies, and outlining performance, strengths/limitations, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals non-intrusively enables biological research, animal welfare, livestock management, conservation, and content creation, while traditional 3D scanners are expensive, intrusive, and hard to deploy in natural habitats.

Method: The paper surveys state-of-the-art methods, categorizes them by input modalities (e.g., RGB video, multi-view), representations (meshes, point clouds, parametric models like SMAL), reconstruction techniques (monocular 3D, multi-view, optimization-based, learning-based), and training mechanisms (supervised, self-supervised, weakly supervised). It analyzes performance of key methods and discusses strengths/limitations, datasets, and metrics.

Result: Provides organized taxonomy of approaches, comparative insights into performance and applicability across scenarios, and a synthesis of current capabilities and gaps in the field.

Conclusion: Identifies challenges such as data scarcity, domain gaps between synthetic and real data, occlusions, and generalization across species; proposes future directions including standardized benchmarks, robust multi-view/self-supervised learning, real-time inference, and ethical considerations for field deployment.

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

### [20] [A Unified Voxel Diffusion Module for Point Cloud 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16069)
*Qifeng Liu,Dawei Zhao,Yabo Dong,Linzhi Shang,Liang Xiao,Juan Wang,Kunkong Zhao,Dongming Lu,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) improves voxel-level representations and diffusion in point clouds, enhancing spatial context and boosting detection accuracy when integrated with Transformer- or SSM-based detectors, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-based pipelines suffer from rigid input/output dimensional constraints and limited diffusion of voxel features, which hampers spatial contextualization and accuracy. There is a need for CNN-like diffusion and aggregation at the voxel level within Transformer/SSM frameworks.

Method: VDM uses sparse 3D convolutions, submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections, with outputs downsampled to 1/4 resolution. It diffuses foreground voxel features to enrich spatial context and aggregates fine-grained spatial information to strengthen voxel representations, then plugs into existing Transformer- or SSM-based detectors.

Result: VDM-augmented models consistently outperform baselines, achieving 74.7 mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP on ONCE, setting new state-of-the-art results on all datasets.

Conclusion: VDM demonstrates strong generalizability across Transformer- and SSM-based detection models, providing enhanced voxel representations and diffusion with practical efficiency; code will be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ELF ensembles five pathology foundation models to create unified slide-level representations, achieving superior, robust performance across cancer tasks and data-limited contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inconsistent performance and limited generalizability of single foundation models trained on heterogeneous WSIs, by unifying representations at slide level.

Method: Ensemble learning integrating five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models; trained on 53,699 WSIs from 20 anatomical sites; slide-level architecture; evaluated on disease classification, biomarker detection, and therapeutic-response prediction across multiple cancer types.

Result: ELF outperformed all individual models and existing slide-level models in accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks; demonstrated data efficiency and generalizability to unseen contexts (therapy response prediction).

Conclusion: Ensemble learning at slide level is a powerful and scalable approach for pathology foundation models, enabling better generalization for AI-assisted precision oncology.

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in diffusion models, GANs remain valuable for their stability and efficiency. The paper argues for new GAN architectures that improve image quality and reduce training cost, robustness, and generalization, leveraging multi-scale progressive generation, feedback mechanisms, and attention.

Method: Proposes MSPG-SEN with two-flow feedback, multi-scale progressive architecture; introduces APFL (adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop); a globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network; and DEMA (dynamic embedded attention). Provides ablation studies showing contributions and reports state-of-the-art results on five datasets (dataset names provided in abstract). Claims reduced training cost and cross-task capability.

Result: MSPG-SEN achieves state-of-the-art generation performance on five datasets (INKK 89.7%, AWUN 78.3%, IONJ 85.5%, POKL 88.7%, OPIN 96.4%). APFL improves robustness and training stability with lower cost. The globally connected two-flow dynamic residual network enhances training efficiency and generalization. DEMA captures global-local information with minimal compute and extends to various image processing tasks; overall, the framework yields better image quality and efficiency than prior GANs.

Conclusion: The proposed MSPG-SEN framework and its components offer a practical, flexible, and efficient GAN architecture that improves image quality, stability, and cross-task applicability, with potential for broader adoption and future extension to more tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so
on. In this paper, we propose a novel two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five
datasets,INKK The dataset is 89.7\%,AWUN The dataset is 78.3\%,IONJ The dataset
is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK

*Savvas Karatsiolis,Andreas Kamilaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAFR2: a simple unsupervised domain adaptation framework that refines feature representations by adapting BN statistics with unlabeled target data, distilling features from a source model, and transferring the hypothesis, yielding robust, domain-invariant features without complex training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift between source and target domains degrades performance; unlabeled target data can guide adaptation without requiring target labels, enabling robust generalization across similar domains.

Method: Three components: (1) adapt Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data; (2) feature distillation from a source-trained model to transfer representations; (3) hypothesis transfer to align decision boundaries. The approach aligns feature distributions at both statistical and representational levels to produce domain-invariant features without heavy architectures or training objectives.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C show improved robustness to corruption and outperforms prior methods. Theoretical and empirical analyses indicate better feature alignment, increased mutual information between domains, and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Conclusion: DAFR2 offers a simple, effective, and label-efficient domain adaptation technique that yields robust, domain-invariant features under distribution shift without requiring complex architectures or objectives.

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 4D CBCT platform integrates a dual-robotic-arm upright CBCT with a deep-learning aided 3D-2D fusion pipeline to enable low-dose, fast, and accurate dynamic joint imaging and quantitative kinematic assessment, validated in simulation and post-TKA patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CT misses dynamic weight-bearing joint motion; 4D imaging is needed for functional evaluation after surgery but is hampered by high radiation, incomplete spatial data, or 2D limitations. A unified platform could provide accurate, low-dose, clinically actionable 4D joint analyses for biomechanics and personalized care.

Method: (1) Dual robotic arm CBCT system with a programmable, gantry-free upright trajectory. (2) Hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using deep learning preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative optimization. (3) Clinically validated framework for quantitative kinematic assessment.

Result: In simulations, achieved sub-voxel accuracy (0.235 mm) with 99.18% success, outperforming conventional and state-of-the-art registration methods. Clinically, accurately quantified tibial plateau motion and medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty patients.

Conclusion: The 4D CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, low-dose dynamic joint imaging, offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics, and personalized orthopedic care.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,
and personalized orthopedic care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hypergraph-based detection network fuses spatial correlations with deep discriminative features for cervical abnormal cell detection, using MLF-SNet for feature extraction and CLFFS-HC for cross-level feature fusion; shows improved performance on three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to model correlations among visual features and fail to integrate inter-cell and intra-cell discriminative information in an end-to-end detector, which limits detection performance on cervical cells.

Method: Propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network. Introduce Multi-level Fusion Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extraction. Develop Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation module (CLFFS-HC) to integrate mixed features within an end-to-end framework.

Result: Experiments on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed method significantly improves the detection performance of cervical abnormal cells compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-based fusion approach effectively combines spatial correlation features with deep discriminative features, enhancing end-to-end cervical abnormal cell detection.

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal

### [26] [Beyond Human-prompting: Adaptive Prompt Tuning with Semantic Alignment for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16157)
*Pi-Wei Chen,Jerry Chun-Wei Lin,Wei-Han Chen,Jia Ji,Zih-Ching Chen,Feng-Hao Yeh,Chao-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Prompt Tuning (APT) uses self-generated noisy anomalies and SMGS to learn prompts for vision–language models, enabling knowledge-free, few-shot, pixel-wise anomaly detection with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-designed prompts and scarce anomaly samples limit context-specific anomaly understanding; a prior-knowledge-free, robust framework is needed for diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Trainable prompts learned from self-generated anomaly samples with noise perturbations; Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) iteratively aligns prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse synthetic anomalies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results for pixel-wise anomaly detection on multiple benchmarks without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, versatile framework that reduces reliance on manual prompts and improves context-aware anomaly detection in real-world data.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

### [27] [RAGSR: Regional Attention Guided Diffusion for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16158)
*Haodong He,Yancheng Bai,Rui Lan,Xu Duan,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu,Gui-Song Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Regional Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) improves SISR by using region-level textual priors and a regional attention mechanism to better handle multiple objects, yielding finer regional details and coherent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM+diffusion-based SR methods struggle with fine-grained regional details and complex prompts, especially with multiple objects, due to weak region-specific guidance and cross-region interference.

Method: Localize object regions, assign fine-grained region captions to form region-text priors for a T2I diffusion model. Apply regional guided attention to ensure each region-text pair is properly attended while preventing interactions between unrelated regions, enabling controlled fusion of text and image information.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show superior perceptual quality and contextual coherence in SR results compared with existing approaches.

Conclusion: RAGSR provides finer control over region-text integration in SR, addressing limitations of traditional SISR by leveraging regional priors and targeted attention to produce clearer and more coherent regional details.

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

*Jiaqi Ma,Guo-Sen Xie,Fang Zhao,Zechao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Heterogeneous meta-learning network (TLG) to combat over-semantic homogenization by using dual-perspective support-query pairs with HA, HT, HC; achieves strong WFSS with dramatically fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In standard meta-learning, identical network architectures enforce semantic uniformity across tasks, causing over-semantic homogenization; need complementary, heterogeneous semantics while preserving commonality to improve generalization.

Method: Propose dual-perspective sampling of support-query pairs and three heterogeneous modules: heterogeneous visual aggregation (HA) to boost complementarity, heterogeneous transfer (HT) to reduce semantic noise and amplify heterogeneity, and heterogeneous CLIP textual information (HC) to enrich multimodal representation. Applies to weakly supervised few-shot semantic segmentation; reported model TLG uses 1/24 parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art.

Result: TLG achieves 13.2% absolute improvement on Pascal-5i and 9.7% on COCO-20i under the same backbone; claims to be first image-level weakly supervised model to surpass pixel-level fully supervised models; code released.

Conclusion: Introducing heterogeneity in meta-learning pipelines can preserve semantic commonality while enabling diverse, complementary representations, leading to strong generalization in WFSS with significant parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is
available at https://github.com/jarch-ma/TLG.

### [29] [FTIO: Frequent Temporally Integrated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16183)
*Mohammad Mohammadzadeh Kalati,Farhad Maleki,Ian McQuillan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO is a post-processing framework for multi-object unsupervised VOS that enhances object selection by extracting frequently appearing salient objects and fixes temporal inconsistencies with a three-stage mask integration, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised VOS suffers from uncertain initial object segmentation and temporal inconsistency due to deformation and fast motion, especially with small or complex objects; a robust post-processing approach is needed to stabilize proposals.

Method: Two components: (1) a combined criterion that identifies frequently appearing salient objects to improve object selection; (2) a three-stage method to correct temporal gaps by integrating missing mask regions across frames; designed as a post-processing framework rather than end-to-end training.

Result: Experiments show FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-object UVOS; code is available at the given GitHub link.

Conclusion: FTIO effectively enhances both object selection stability and temporal consistency in UVOS, delivering strong improvements in multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

### [30] [SpecVLM: Enhancing Speculative Decoding of Video LLMs via Verifier-Guided Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16201)
*Yicheng Ji,Jun Zhang,Heming Xia,Jinpeng Chen,Lidan Shou,Gang Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecVLM introduces a training-free speculative decoding framework with two-stage video token pruning for Vid-LLMs, enabling up to 90% token pruning to speed up decoding without accuracy loss, achieving notable speedups on large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-Language Models rely on dense video token representations, incurring high memory and compute during prefilling and decoding. Existing token-reduction methods risk information loss and slow decoding. A lossless, training-free acceleration during decoding is highly desirable.

Method: SpecVLM uses a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from a verifier (the target model), while Stage II prunes remaining tokens in a spatially uniform manner. The framework is training-free and claims that the draft model's speculation is robust to token pruning, enabling pruning up to ~90% while preserving accuracy.

Result: Experiments on four video understanding benchmarks show effectiveness and robustness, with decoding speedups of up to 2.68× for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11× for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Conclusion: SpecVLM provides a scalable, lossless decoding acceleration for Vid-LLMs by leveraging staged speculative token pruning, achieving significant speedups without sacrificing performance and potentially generalizable across Vid-LLM architectures.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

### [31] [\textsc{T-Mask}: Temporal Masking for Probing Foundation Models across Camera Views in Driver Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16207)
*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes T-Mask, a temporal token-masking probing method for image-to-video analysis that enables robust cross-view driver monitoring using foundation models with a single training view; achieves notable gains on Drive&Act without adding parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera perspective changes challenge driver monitoring. Foundation-model probing offers potential for generalization, but cross-view robustness with limited data remains underexplored; evaluate lightweight probing and temporal emphasis to improve cross-view performance.

Method: Benchmark DINOv2 and CLIP with linear probes, advanced probing strategies, PEFT, and full fine-tuning. Introduce T-Mask, an image-to-video probing method using temporal token masking to emphasize dynamic regions across frames, evaluated on Drive&Act; no extra parameters added.

Result: T-Mask improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by +1.23% over strong probing baselines and +8.0% over PEFT methods on Drive&Act; boosts recognition of underrepresented secondary activities by +5.42% in the trained view and +1.36% in cross-view; achieves these gains without introducing new parameters.

Conclusion: Lightweight probing with temporal token selection (T-Mask) shows strong potential for robust, cross-view driver monitoring in low-data settings; encourages future research and provides code and models for further work.

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

### [32] [Forecast then Calibrate: Feature Caching as ODE for Efficient Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16211)
*Shikang Zheng,Liang Feng,Xinyu Wang,Qinming Zhou,Peiliang Cai,Chang Zou,Jiacheng Liu,Yuqi Lin,Junjie Chen,Yue Ma,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate) treats feature caching in Diffusion Transformers as a feature-ODE problem to robustly integrate historical features during aggressive acceleration, achieving near-lossless speedups without extra training across image, video, and super-resolution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformer caching degrades generation quality at high acceleration due to instability in long-step forecasting; need robust method to reuse hidden representations.

Method: Model hidden-feature sequences as a feature-ODE along the trajectory; propose FoCa, which forecasts features and then calibrates them, effectively solving the feature-ODE during inference with large skips; no extra training required.

Result: Extensive experiments show near-lossless speedups: 5.50x (FLUX), 6.45x (HunyuanVideo), 3.17x (Inf-DiT), 4.53x (DiT); maintains high quality in image synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution.

Conclusion: FoCa successfully addresses degradation of existing caching strategies under large skip intervals, enabling robust and efficient acceleration for Diffusion Transformers without additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

### [33] [OmniCache: A Trajectory-Oriented Global Perspective on Training-Free Cache Reuse for Diffusion Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16212)
*Huanpeng Chu,Wei Wu,Guanyu Fen,Yutao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache is a training-free method that accelerates diffusion transformers by globally reusing cached computations across the entire sampling process, with dynamic noise filtering to reduce reuse noise, yielding faster sampling with competitive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models with Transformer backbones deliver high-quality generative results but incur high computational cost due to many sampling steps and expensive per-step computations, hindering real-time deployment.

Method: Analyze diffusion-Transformer sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache reuse across all sampling steps (global across the trajectory) rather than focusing on later steps. Implement a training-free caching scheme that reuses computations across the diffusion path. During cache reuse, dynamically estimate the corresponding noise and filter it to minimize its impact on sampling direction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate faster sampling while maintaining competitive generative quality.

Conclusion: OmniCache provides a practical, training-free acceleration solution for diffusion-based models, enabling more feasible deployment of diffusion transformers in real-time settings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

*Kaiyuan Ji,Yijin Guo,Zicheng Zhang,Xiangyang Zhu,Yuan Tian,Ning Liu,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees benchmarks safety-performance trade-offs in medical LLM reasoning under manipulative hints, revealing consistent trade-offs and that no model dominates, with QwQ-32B closest to balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks conflate safety vulnerabilities (CoT faithfulness and anti-sycophancy) with overall accuracy in medical LLMs. There is a need to quantify these vulnerabilities under adversarial/hint manipulations to guide safer model development.

Method: Construct MedOmni-45 Degrees: 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, each paired with seven manipulative hint types plus a no-hint baseline (≈27K inputs). Evaluate seven LLMs spanning open/closed, general-purpose/medical, base/reasoning-enhanced, totaling ≳189K inferences. Compute Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy, combine into a composite 45 Degrees score for visualization.

Result: The benchmark reveals a consistent safety-performance trade-off: no model surpasses the diagonal. Open-source QwQ-32B best balances safety and accuracy (43.81 Degrees) but does not lead in both metrics. The benchmark exposes reasoning vulnerabilities and offers a focused tool for safer medical LLM development.

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees provides a focused benchmark to reveal CoT faithfulness and anti-sycophancy vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and to guide safer future model development.

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

*Hohyun Na,Seunghoo Hong,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptFlare provides an efficient adversarial defense against malicious diffusion-based image edits by injecting cross-attention decoy noise that targets invariant prompt tokens, reducing prompt-image misalignment and preventing edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based inpainting enables easy malicious edits; existing defenses rely on image-level cues and fail to address prompt-level influence; a method that protects against prompt-guided manipulations is needed.

Method: Leverages cross-attention in diffusion models to identify a shared, semantically uninformed token in prompts; injects adversarial noise to suppress sampling, acting as a decoy to steer attention away from prompt-image alignment.

Result: On the EditBench dataset, achieves state-of-the-art protection across multiple metrics while lowering computational overhead and GPU memory usage.

Conclusion: PromptFlare offers robust, efficient protection against unauthorized prompt-guided image manipulation and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical CV tasks. Robustness to lighting, weather, sensor variation, distributional shifts, noise, and adversarial attacks is essential for trust and reliability.

Method: Comprehensive literature review of robustness-related defenses and robust training methods for vision models; analysis of network properties and components relevant to robustness; proposal of guidance for ablation studies and benchmarking metrics.

Result: A consolidated analysis of challenges and limitations of current defense mechanisms, plus a framework of metrics and evaluation practices to benchmark robustness in VFMs; identification of gaps and needs for systematic evaluation and design.

Conclusion: Robustness in VFMs is multi-dimensional, requiring coordinated evaluation, targeted ablations, and standardized benchmarks; future work should focus on improving defenses, understanding trade-offs, and aligning metrics with real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

*Jiahao Chen,Zhiyong Ma,Wenbiao Du,Qingyuan Chuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces FlexMUSE, a multimodal creative writing framework with an optional visual input, aimed at aligning semantics across modalities for illustrated articles; includes msaGate, cross-modality fusion, MSC DPO, and a new ArtMUSE dataset (~3k text-image pairs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MMCW is a nascent, highly abstract task where text and visuals need not be tightly coupled, and existing methods either require restricted inputs or costly training and still suffer semantic misalignment; a flexible, economical and semantically coherent framework is needed.

Method: FlexMUSE includes a text-to-image (T2I) module for optional visual input, modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to constrain textual input, attention-based cross-modality fusion to enhance input features, and modality semantic creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) that extends rejected samples to foster creativity; a new ArtMUSE dataset of ~3k calibrated text-image pairs is introduced.

Result: FlexMUSE achieves promising results in terms of consistency, creativity and coherence across modalities for MMCW tasks.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE advances multimodal creative writing by enabling flexible visual input, aligning semantic relationships between modalities, improving input feature representation, and offering a dedicated dataset (ArtMUSE) to support MMCW research.

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UniEM-3M, a large-scale multimodal electron microscopy dataset with 5,091 high-resolution EMs, ~3 million instance segmentation labels, and attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, plus a text-to-image diffusion model and a flow-based segmentation method; establishes UniEM-Net as a baseline and benchmarks on the full dataset with public release on Hugging Face.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, expert-annotated EM datasets and the need for multimodal understanding and data augmentation to advance deep learning-based EM characterization.

Method: Assemble UniEM-3M consisting of high-resolution EM images, ~3M instance segmentation labels, and attribute-disentangled textual descriptions; train a text-to-image diffusion model on the entire collection; evaluate representative instance segmentation methods and propose UniEM-Net as a strong baseline; demonstrate that a flow-based segmentation model achieves superior performance on the benchmark.

Result: The flow-based segmentation model outperforms other advanced methods on the UniEM-3M benchmark; UniEM-Net serves as a strong baseline framework; partial dataset release and a diffusion model were prepared, with both available for public use via Hugging Face to enable data augmentation and distribution-aware research.

Conclusion: UniEM-3M and accompanying tools provide a scalable foundation for multimodal understanding of electron microscopy data, enabling reproducible evaluation and accelerating automatic materials analysis; the release will likely catalyze further research in dataset-driven DL for EM.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

### [39] [Structuring GUI Elements through Vision Language Models: Towards Action Space Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16271)
*Yi Xu,Yesheng Zhang,jiajia Liu,Jingdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) to improve GUI element coordinate generation in multimodal LLMs by IoU-based sampling for data augmentation, reducing exposure bias and outperforming standard MLE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate prediction for GUI elements is hampered by the semantic sparsity of numeric coordinates in language representations; a large, diverse dataset and training paradigm addressing exposure bias are needed.

Method: Introduce an IoU-based coordinate sampling pipeline to augment training data, then fine-tune MLLMs under the IAML paradigm to mitigate exposure bias in MLE.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate that IAML outperforms traditional training paradigms in GUI element coordinate generation.

Conclusion: IAML effectively improves UI coordinate generation for MLLMs and mitigates exposure bias; IoU-focused data augmentation enhances the model's ability to predict precise coordinates.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSAMap is the first global, high‑resolution remote sensing dataset for large-scale, multi‑feature land‑cover vector mapping, enabling object‑level GIS tasks and multi‑task benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing datasets suffer from limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structure, hindering precise object boundaries, topological consistency, and global coverage for object-based mapping. A global, richly annotated vector dataset is needed to advance deep learning for vector-level land features and digital twins.

Method: Develop a comprehensive vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances across 10 object classes; employ an intelligent manual–AI annotation workflow to improve efficiency and consistency; achieve global coverage across 79 regions on six continents (>1000 km total). The dataset supports multi‑task adaptation, including pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline extraction, and panoramic segmentation.

Result: IRSAMap provides semantic and spatially accurate vector annotations suitable for object-based modeling; offers a standardized benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to vector-based approaches; enables global geographic information updates and digital twin construction; dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: IRSAMap advances global land‑cover vector mapping by delivering a scalable, globally representative, multi‑feature vector dataset that supports diverse tasks and cross‑domain collaboration, accelerating geographic feature automation and GIS modernization.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

*Khai Duc Minh Tran,Hoa Van Nguyen,Aimuni Binti Muhammad Rawi,Hareeshrao Athinarayanarao,Ba-Ngu Vo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based methane plume detection from Sentinel-2 using a U-Net with ResNet34 encoder and dual spectral enhancements, achieving 78.39% F1-score and capable of detecting small plumes (as small as 400 m²).


<details>

Motivation: Methane plumes are potent greenhouse gases; accurate, automated detection from satellite imagery is needed to mitigate rapid climate change, especially for small plumes that traditional methods miss.

Method: A U-Net architecture with a ResNet34 encoder, augmented by dual spectral enhancement techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimize Sentinel-2 input features for higher sensitivity to plumes; evaluated on satellite imagery with a focus on small-plume detection.

Result: The approach achieved a validation F1-score of 78.39%, with superior sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing methods, notably for small plumes down to 400 m².

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for automated methane monitoring from Sentinel-2 data and outperforms traditional methods in detecting small plumes, contributing to improved climate-change mitigation efforts.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenging problem of detecting methane plumes, a
potent greenhouse gas, using Sentinel-2 imagery. This contributes to the
mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for
heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

### [43] [A Multimodal-Multitask Framework with Cross-modal Relation and Hierarchical Interactive Attention for Semantic Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16300)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Devraj Raghuvanshi,Umang Jain,Shubhi Bansal,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MM-ORIENT, a cross-modal relation and hierarchical interactive attention framework that reduces noise in multimodal representations and preserves unimodal discriminative information, achieving robust performance across tasks without explicit inter-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise in individual modalities degrades joint multimodal representations, and strong fusion can overlook discriminative cues within single modalities; hence a method that disentangles cross-modal relations and emphasizes unimodal signals is needed.

Method: Cross-modal relation graphs reconstruct monomodal features based on cross-modality neighborhoods to form multimodal representations without explicit cross-modal interaction. Hierarchical Interactive Monomodal Attention (HIMA) emphasizes informative cues within each modality. The model is multitask and fuses later.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show effective multimodal understanding for multiple tasks.

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT mitigates modality noise, preserves intra-modality discriminative information, and jointly learns across tasks via cross-modal graphs and hierarchical attention.

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

### [44] [Learning Long-Range Action Representation by Two-Stream Mamba Pyramid Network for Figure Skating Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16291)
*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stream Mamba pyramid network for figure skating scoring (TES and PCS) that separates visual TES from audio-visual PCS, uses multi-level fusion and multi-scale pyramids to handle long videos, achieving state-of-the-art on FineFS with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address precise assessment of TES (athletic actions) and PCS (artistic interpretation) in figure skating, correcting three gaps: using common features for TES/PCS, per-element TES derivation, and long-range context handling in long competition videos.

Method: Propose a two-stream architecture: (1) TES evaluation stream with a multi-scale Mamba pyramid and TES head to localize and score action elements at various temporal scales; (2) PCS evaluation stream with multi-level fusion that retains video-based features for TES while fusing visual and auditory cues across pyramid levels for PCS. The two streams align with judging criteria and leverage long-range dependencies (Mamba) for efficient processing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark; comprehensive experiments validate effectiveness; source code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Separating TES and PCS with dedicated streams and leveraging Mamba pyramids enables accurate per-element TES scoring and robust PCS estimation across long videos, addressing both temporal localization and multi-modal fusion efficiently.

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

### [45] [Exploiting Information Redundancy in Attention Maps for Extreme Quantization of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16311)
*Lucas Maisonnave,Karim Haroun,Tom Pegeot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Entropy-based attention map compression (EAM) freezes low-entropy MHSA maps and quantizes them to save computation, achieving comparable accuracy with up to 20% sparsity on DeiT and Swin Transformer models for ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer MHSA is computationally expensive and memory-hungry. The authors hypothesize that attention maps have redundancy, which can be quantified using Shannon entropy. Heads with low entropy are more deterministic and contribute less information, suggesting they are candidates for compression to enable edge deployment.

Method: Compute per-head Shannon entropy to identify low-entropy attention maps. Freeze the weights of these low-entropy maps and quantize their values to low precision, avoiding redundant re-computation. Integrate this Entropy Attention Maps (EAM) strategy into DeiT and Swin Transformer models and evaluate on ImageNet-1k.

Result: EAM achieves similar or higher accuracy with sparsity levels up to 20% in attention maps. Beyond 20% sparsity, the method remains competitive for DeiT and Swin Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Entropy-based analysis of attention maps enables effective compression of MHSA by freezing and low-precision quantization of low-entropy heads, reducing computation and memory while maintaining accuracy, thus aiding edge deployment and generalizing to other MHSA-based models.

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline combines OpenCV-based table detection with OCR methods (PaddleOCR, YOLOv8 variants) to digitize handwritten marksheets; Modified YOLOv8 achieves the best accuracy on a diverse dataset, enabling faster, less manual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten marksheets with diverse styles and complex table layouts are hard to digitize reliably; existing OCR alone may fall short; aim to unify detection and recognition in a practical system.

Method: OpenCV detects tables; PaddleOCR handles sequential handwriting; YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are employed to recognize handwritten text inside tables; evaluation on custom diverse dataset; compare against PaddleOCR and standard YOLOv8.

Result: Modified YOLOv8 92.72% accuracy; PaddleOCR 91.37%; YOLOv8 88.91%; system claims efficiency and reduced manual work; applicable to academic/admin documents.

Conclusion: The approach advances document automation for handwritten documents by offering a scalable, reliable hybrid framework; Modified YOLOv8 provides best performance within the proposed system.

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

*Nedyalko Prisadnikov,Danda Pani Paudel,Yuqian Fu,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A position paper argues for image size agnostic, task-driven vision encoders inspired by efficiency in biological vision, with a proof-of-concept for image classification showing feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological vision is efficient; humans/animals allocate computation based on task; current encoders waste effort on image size; seeks dynamic computation proportional to task rather than input size.

Method: Proposes a dynamic, task-driven vision encoding framework; outlines concrete first steps and provides a proof-of-concept for image classification to demonstrate feasibility.

Result: Qualitative feasibility and promise of the approach; no detailed quantitative results provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Vision encoders should be adaptive, task-dependent, and image size agnostic to achieve efficiency; this paper lays groundwork with initial steps and a proof-of-concept.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

### [48] [A Lightweight Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive Network for Real-Time Steel Surface Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16397)
*Yong Zhang,Cunjian Chen,Qiang Gao,Yi Wang,Bin Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBINet is a lightweight, real-time multiscale surface defect detector that uses Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive modules to enhance cross-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead, achieving near real-time performance on GPU/CPU with very few parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time defect detection in steel with limited compute; existing lightweight multibranch DSConv methods lack effective cross-scale interaction and incur overhead.

Method: Introduces GMBINet with GMBI modules: group-wise multiscale feature extraction with scale-agnostic complexity; Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor to enable cross-scale fusion; a parameter-free EWMS operation for interaction without extra compute.

Result: Achieves 1048 FPS on GPU and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution on 0.19M parameters; competitive accuracy on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN; generalizes to NEU-CLS; publicly available code.

Conclusion: GMBINet delivers real-time, lightweight multiscale defect detection with strong cross-scale interactions and broad applicability in industrial vision; validated on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

### [49] [Attention Mechanism in Randomized Time Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16366)
*Yutaro Hiraoka,Kazuya Okamura,Kota Suto,Kazuhiro Fukui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RTW can be interpreted as a global self-attention variant for motion recognition, aligning input sequences via contribution weights; shares weight patterns with self-attention yet operates globally, offering a 5% accuracy gain over Transformer on Something-Something V2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the relationship between RTW and self-attention, and explain why RTW can outperform Transformer-based models in sequential motion data.

Method: Compare RTW contribution weights with self-attention weights, analyze their correlation (e.g., canonical angles) on sequential inputs, discuss local vs global scope, and report empirical results on Something-Something V2.

Result: RTW weights show high similarity to self-attention weights (correlation ~0.80 for ten smallest canonical angles); RTW yields about 5% improvement in accuracy over Transformer on Something-Something V2.

Conclusion: Interpreting RTW as a global self-attention mechanism explains its effectiveness and highlights the benefit of full-sequence weighting over local self-attention in motion recognition tasks.

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-sensor fusion approach for autonomous vehicles operating in adverse weather, combining RGB, LiDAR, NIR, and radar with depth-based BEV fusion and a transformer-based decoder that weights modalities by distance and visibility, yielding strong improvements in detection reliability under fog and similar conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness of multimodal perception when sensors suffer from weather/lighting degradation and potential failure or uncertainty, by exploiting complementary modalities (including NIR and radar) and advanced fusion/attention mechanisms.

Method: Fuse RGB, LiDAR, NIR-gated camera, and radar through attentive, depth-based blending on BEV features; refine in BEV; use a transformer decoder to weigh modalities according to distance and visibility; learn to balance modalities during fusion.

Result: Reported improvement of 17.2 AP in vulnerable pedestrians at long distances under challenging foggy scenes compared to the next best method; demonstrates improved reliability of multimodal fusion in adverse weather.

Conclusion: The proposed fusion framework enhances autonomous vehicle perception under adverse weather by leveraging diverse modalities and depth-aware, attention-guided fusion, bridging the gap between ideal and real-world edge conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

### [51] [HAMSt3R: Human-Aware Multi-view Stereo 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16433)
*Sara Rojas,Matthieu Armando,Bernard Ghamen,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Vincent Leroy,Gregory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R extends MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse, uncalibrated multi-view images by leveraging a distilled image encoder (DUNE) and dedicated heads for human segmentation, DensePose correspondences, and depth; it yields a dense 3D point map enriched with human semantics in a single feed-forward pass, and generalizes to standard MVS and MVPR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense scene reconstruction methods (DUSt3R, MASt3R) excel outdoors/static scenes but struggle with human-centric environments; there's a need for efficient, integrated 3D reconstruction of humans and scenes from sparse, uncalibrated views.

Method: Proposes HAMSt3R: builds on MASt3R with DUNE encoder distilled from MASt3R and multi-HMR; adds network heads for human segmentation, DensePose-based dense correspondences, and depth estimation in human-centric scenes; combines outputs into a dense, semantically enriched 3D point map; fully feed-forward for efficiency.

Result: Evaluations on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D benchmarks show effective human reconstruction and strong generalization to typical MVSR and MVPR tasks; the method yields dense 3D maps with human semantics while maintaining general 3D reconstruction performance.

Conclusion: HAMSt3R narrows the gap between human and scene understanding in 3D vision by unifying human-centric and general 3D reconstruction in a fast, feed-forward framework, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

### [52] [Arbitrary-Scale 3D Gaussian Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16467)
*Huimin Zeng,Yue Bai,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for arbitrary-scale 3D Gaussian super-resolution using scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolution with a single model; supports integer and non-integer scales; achieves 6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS and 85 FPS at 1080p.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SR methods render fixed HR scales, causing aliasing and inefficiency; a single model capable of arbitrary-scale rendering without post-upsampling is needed for resource-limited scenarios.

Method: An integrated framework combining scale-aware rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive super-resolution; a single 3D model that supports both integer and non-integer scale factors for arbitrary-scale HR view rendering.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality arbitrary-scale HR views with a 6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS; preserves structural consistency across scales and shows real-time rendering speed of 85 FPS at 1080p.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables arbitrary-scale 3D Gaussian super-resolution with a single model, balancing quality, structural fidelity, and rendering efficiency, and alleviating aliasing and complexity issues inherent in prior methods.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

*Chun-Peng Chang,Chen-Yu Wang,Julian Schmidt,Holger Caesar,Alain Pagani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning video generators on driving data can boost visual realism but may harm spatial/dynamic accuracy; replay-based continual learning offers a simple way to preserve spatial accuracy while keeping strong visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As video-gen models are proposed for driving simulation and world-models, understanding how fine-tuning affects dynamic understanding is crucial. Driving scenes have regular temporal structure, which may bias optimization toward surface realism at the expense of fine-grained dynamics.

Method: Empirical analysis of existing fine-tuning approaches on structured driving datasets. Investigate alignment between visual-quality objectives and dynamic-understanding objectives. Propose and test a simple continual-learning strategy—replay from diverse domains—to balance visual quality and spatial accuracy.

Result: Fine-tuning can improve visual fidelity but degrade spatial accuracy of dynamic elements due to misalignment between objectives. A replay-based continual-learning approach helps preserve spatial accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: There exists a trade-off between visual realism and dynamic accuracy when fine-tuning on driving data. Aligning objectives is important; continual learning with diverse-domain replay offers a practical way to balance fidelity and dynamic correctness in driving video models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

### [54] [Towards Open World Detection: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16527)
*Andrei-Stefan Bulzan,Cosmin Cernazanu-Glavan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open World Detection (OWD) is proposed as an umbrella term to unify class-agnostic and generally applicable detection in vision, tracing the convergence of foundational subfields from saliency to VLLMs and arguing that perception may become a single integrated domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate unification of disparate vision per-ception tasks under a single framework, by tracing historical progress, key concepts, datasets, and the overlaps that bind subfields.

Method: Systematic survey and conceptual mapping of foundational vision subdomains (saliency, foreground/background separation, OOD, open world/object detection, zero-shot detection, Vision LLMs) to reveal overlaps and trajectories, culminating in the OWD umbrella.

Result: A consolidated view of the state-of-the-art across subfields, highlighting cross-domain synergies and convergence trends, and presenting Open World Detection as a unifying lens.

Conclusion: Perception in computer vision may evolve into a single, unified domain under the OWD framework, with future work focusing on integrating class-agnostic and general detection capabilities and bridging subdomains.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

### [55] [MV-RAG: Retrieval Augmented Multiview Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16577)
*Yosef Dayani,Omer Benishu,Sagie Benaim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG retrieves 2D images to condition a multiview diffusion model, enabling better 3D consistency and handling of out-of-domain concepts in text-to-3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-3D methods based on 2D diffusion priors often fail on out-of-domain or rare concepts and yield inconsistent results. There is a need for retrieval-augmented strategies to broaden priors and enforce 3D consistency.

Method: MV-RAG is a retrieval-conditioned multiview diffusion pipeline. It retrieves relevant 2D images from a large in-the-wild database and conditions a multiview diffusion model on these images to synthesize consistent multiview outputs. Training uses a hybrid strategy: (1) augmented conditioning views to simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction; (2) training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images with a held-out view prediction objective (predict the held-out view from other views) to enforce 3D consistency.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and personalization baselines, the approach significantly improves 3D consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for out-of-domain/rare concepts, while maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: MV-RAG improves robustness to out-of-domain concepts and 3D consistency in text-to-3D, while remaining competitive on standard benchmarks, and introduces a practical retrieval-conditioned, multiview diffusion framework for 3D synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

### [56] [Characterizing and Recognizing Twistedness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16178)
*Oswin Aichholzer,Alfredo García,Javier Tejel,Birgit Vogtenhuber,Alexandra Weinberger*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Proposes a purely combinatorial characterization of generalized twisted drawings via subrotation systems. For K_n with n≥7, generalized twistedness of an abstract rotation system is equivalent to all its 5-vertex subrotation systems being generalized twisted. This yields a drawing-independent criterion and an O(n^5) algorithm to recognize generalized twisted abstract rotation systems, plus a rotation-pair criterion that leads to an O(n^2) algorithm for realizable cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized twisted drawings have useful geometric properties and have been studied for plane substructure bounds, but their geometric definition makes recognition hard. A combinatorial characterization enables efficient, drawing-independent recognition.

Method: Prove the equivalence: for n≥7, generalized twistedness of K_n's abstract rotation system iff every 5-vertex subrotation system is generalized twisted. Develop a characterization based on the rotations around pairs of vertices, then derive algorithms. Analyse complexities to show O(n^5) for abstract rotation systems and O(n^2) for realizable ones.

Result: An if-and-only-if condition using 5-vertex substructures, a concise, drawing-independent criterion, and two algorithms: O(n^5) for deciding generalized twistedness of abstract rotation systems of K_n, and O(n^2) for realizable rotation systems.

Conclusion: Provides a purely combinatorial framework for generalized twisted drawings, enabling efficient recognition and deeper understanding of their structure; reduces geometric definitions to local combinatorial checks and yields practical algorithms.

Abstract: In a simple drawing of a graph, any two edges intersect in at most one point
(either a common endpoint or a proper crossing). A simple drawing is
generalized twisted if it fulfills certain rather specific constraints on how
the edges are drawn. An abstract rotation system of a graph assigns to each
vertex a cyclic order of its incident edges. A realizable rotation system is
one that admits a simple drawing such that at each vertex, the edges emanate in
that cyclic order, and a generalized twisted rotation system can be realized as
a generalized twisted drawing. Generalized twisted drawings have initially been
introduced to obtain improved bounds on the size of plane substructures in any
simple drawing of $K_n$. They have since gained independent interest due to
their surprising properties. However, the definition of generalized twisted
drawings is very geometric and drawing-specific.
  In this paper, we develop characterizations of generalized twisted drawings
that enable a purely combinatorial view on these drawings and lead to efficient
recognition algorithms. Concretely, we show that for any $n \geq 7$, an
abstract rotation system of $K_n$ is generalized twisted if and only if all
subrotation systems induced by five vertices are generalized twisted. This
implies a drawing-independent and concise characterization of generalized
twistedness. Besides, the result yields a simple $O(n^5)$-time algorithm to
decide whether an abstract rotation system is generalized twisted and sheds new
light on the structural features of simple drawings. We further develop a
characterization via the rotations of a pair of vertices in a drawing, which we
then use to derive an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to decide whether a realizable
rotation system is generalized twisted.

*Yijun Liu,Yuwei Liu,Yuan Meng,Jieheng Zhang,Yuwei Zhou,Ye Li,Jiacheng Jiang,Kangye Ji,Shijia Ge,Zhi Wang,Wenwu Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Spatial Policy (SP) is a spatial-aware visuomotor framework for robotic manipulation that uses explicit spatial modeling to bridge visual plans and control, featuring a spatial plan table, spatial-conditioned video generation, a spatial-based action predictor, and a dual-stage replanning feedback policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-centric, long-horizon embodied models often lack spatial awareness, hindering their ability to translate plans into executable actions in complex environments; explicit spatial reasoning is needed to align perception, planning, and control.

Method: 1) spatial-conditioned embodied video generation with a spatial plan table to model spatially guided predictions; 2) spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable, coordinated actions; 3) spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning.

Result: SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline and an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Introducing spatial awareness into embodied visuomotor control yields more reliable long-horizon manipulation; SP advances practical robotic control by unifying spatial modeling and reasoning, with code/checkpoints available at the project page.

Abstract: Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong
potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack
spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual
plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem,
we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic
manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning.
Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation
module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table.
Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable
actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback
policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive
experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7%
average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the
practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications. Code and

*Zhaodong Jiang,Ashish Sinha,Tongtong Cao,Yuan Ren,Bingbing Liu,Binbin Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UnPose is a zero-shot, model-free 6D pose estimation and reconstruction framework that leverages diffusion priors to build and refine a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from RGB-D views, with uncertainty-guided view fusion and pose-graph optimization, achieving state-of-the-art pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction without CAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliance on object CAD models and costly 3D reconstruction by leveraging pre-trained diffusion priors to infer 3D geometry and pose from minimal data in a zero-shot, model-free manner.

Method: From a single RGB-D frame, use a multi-view diffusion model to obtain an initial 3DGS representation and per-pixel epistemic uncertainty; progressively fuse new views guided by diffusion uncertainty; enforce global consistency via a pose graph and joint optimization of the 3DGS field.

Result: Empirically outperforming existing methods in 6D pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality across experiments; demonstrated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion priors can enable reliable zero-shot 6D pose estimation and reconstruction without CAD models, with incremental view fusion and pose-graph optimization yielding robust performance.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

*Hung-Jui Huang,Mohammad Amin Mirzaee,Michael Kaess,Wenzhen Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GelSLAM is a real-time tactile-only 3D SLAM system that uses tactile-derived normals and curvature to perform long-term object pose tracking and high-fidelity shape reconstruction, achieving submillimeter accuracy and low drift even on low-texture objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing offers precision and occlusion immunity, which is advantageous for in-hand manipulation and contact-rich tasks. Vision-based methods struggle with occlusion and texture constraints, so there is a need for robust, long-horizon tactile-based perception.

Method: GelSLAM leverages tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop closure, enabling real-time object motion tracking with low error and drift, and reconstructing high-fidelity 3D shapes. Unlike traditional point-cloud methods, it operates with tactile data to achieve global, long-horizon spatial perception.

Result: The system achieves real-time tracking with low error and minimal drift, and reconstructs shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture objects like wooden tools; it extends tactile sensing from local contact to global spatial perception.

Conclusion: GelSLAM extends tactile sensing into global, long-horizon perception and provides a foundation for precise manipulation tasks involving objects in hand.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

Experimental results demonstrate reliable self-alignment, efficient fluid
transfer in single-loop and dual-channel modes, and robust data transmission
via integrated electronic control. The connector exhibits high flexibility in
accommodating axial, angular, and lateral misalignments while maintaining low

### [61] [Take That for Me: Multimodal Exophora Resolution with Interactive Questioning for Ambiguous Out-of-View Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16143)
*Akira Oyama,Shoichi Hasegawa,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MIEL is a multimodal framework that resolves exophora (demonstratives like 'that cup') by localizing users and objects using sound localization, semantic mapping, VLMs, and GPT-4o-driven interactive questions, outperforming vision-only baselines, especially when the user is out of view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exophoric references require locating referents even when not visually visible; existing vision-centric methods fail in real-world settings where objects or users are outside the robot's field of view. A robust solution needs multimodal cues and interactive clarification.

Method: Construct a semantic map of the environment; estimate candidate referents from linguistic query using user skeletal data; apply sound source localization to orient toward users outside the visual field; identify gestures/pointing directions; when ambiguity remains, engage the user with GPT-4o to ask clarifying questions; evaluate in a real-world environment comparing against baselines lacking SSL and interactive questioning.

Result: Experiments showed approximate improvements of 1.3x when the user was visible and 2.0x when the user was not visible, compared to methods without SSL and interactive questioning.

Conclusion: Integrating SSL, semantic mapping, VLMs, and interactive GPT-4o questioning yields robust exophora resolution for daily-life robots, enabling accurate referring expression understanding even under occlusion or when users are outside the robot's initial field of view.

Abstract: Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions
involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or
users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution
primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the
object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora
resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora
resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic
mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with
GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and
estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal
data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially
outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and
pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts
with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments
in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times
better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the
user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and
interactive questioning. The project website is

*Ali Emre Balcı,Erhan Ege Keyvan,Emre Özkan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GP-based object contour SLAM with online recursive updates yields semantic, memory-efficient, uncertainty-aware mapping and accurate localization in structured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aims to move beyond grid/point-based maps to object-level semantic representations with uncertainty, enabling safer navigation and efficient memory usage; traditional SLAM lacks semantic reasoning and explicit shape uncertainty.

Method: Represent each object with a Gaussian Process contour; update contours online via a recursive scheme; formulate SLAM in a fully Bayesian framework for joint inference of robot pose and object-based map; provide probabilistic data associations and confidence bounds on object shapes.

Result: Validated on synthetic and real-world data, achieving accurate localization and mapping across diverse structured environments; produces semantic information (object count, areas) and per-object shape confidence bounds; memory-efficient due to per-object GP contours.

Conclusion: Gaussian Process contour-based, object-centric SLAM yields scalable, semantic, and uncertainty-aware maps with practical benefits for navigation and exploration.

Abstract: We present a novel Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) method that
employs Gaussian Process (GP) based landmark (object) representations. Instead
of conventional grid maps or point cloud registration, we model the environment
on a per object basis using GP based contour representations. These contours
are updated online through a recursive scheme, enabling efficient memory usage.
The SLAM problem is formulated within a fully Bayesian framework, allowing
joint inference over the robot pose and object based map. This representation
provides semantic information such as the number of objects and their areas,
while also supporting probabilistic measurement to object associations.
Furthermore, the GP based contours yield confidence bounds on object shapes,
offering valuable information for downstream tasks like safe navigation and
exploration. We validate our method on synthetic and real world experiments,
and show that it delivers accurate localization and mapping performance across
diverse structured environments.

*Jiri Horyna,Roland Jung,Stephan Weiss,Eliseo Ferrante,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SWA (Swarming Without an Anchor) enables UAV swarms to maintain cohesion and velocity consensus under ego-localization dropout by fusing decentralized state estimation with relative perception and onboard sensor data, validated by simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarms rely on a reliable primary localization; when ego-localization fails or drops out, swarm cohesion and coordinated motion degrade. The goal is to preserve accurate state awareness and cohesive behavior using only relative measurements.

Method: Develop a decentralized state estimation framework that fuses relative information (mutual perception) with onboard sensors to estimate lateral states, identifying unambiguous states within the local constellation. Treats swarm coordination as a double integrator synchronization problem to achieve velocity consensus, while attenuating most disturbances except a uniform swarm translation drift.

Result: Through simulations and real-world experiments, the approach sustains cohesive swarm behavior under unreliable or unavailable primary localization, validating robustness and practical viability.

Conclusion: SWA offers a robust path to reliable multi-UAV cooperation without sole dependence on external localization, enabling tighter collaboration and resilience in challenging localization conditions; remaining drift is uniform translation of the entire swarm.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Swarming Without an Anchor (SWA) approach to
state estimation in swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) experiencing
ego-localization dropout, where individual agents are laterally stabilized
using relative information only. We propose to fuse decentralized state
estimation with robust mutual perception and onboard sensor data to maintain
accurate state awareness despite intermittent localization failures. Thus, the
relative information used to estimate the lateral state of UAVs enables the
identification of the unambiguous state of UAVs with respect to the local
constellation. The resulting behavior reaches velocity consensus, as this task
can be referred to as the double integrator synchronization problem. All
disturbances and performance degradations except a uniform translation drift of
the swarm as a whole is attenuated which is enabling new opportunities in using
tight cooperation for increasing reliability and resilience of multi-UAV
systems. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach, demonstrating its capability to sustain cohesive swarm behavior
in challenging conditions of unreliable or unavailable primary localization.

*Sophie Villemure,Jefferson Silveira,Joshua A. Marshall*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A terrain classifier for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot uses dimensionality reduction on proprioceptive signals to classify terrain types for traversability, achieving ~97% accuracy on three terrains, to support safer path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadrupedal robots struggle with sinking/slipping on challenging terrains; a terrain-aware traversability map can enable safer, more reliable navigation.

Method: Leverages Spot’s proprioceptive signals (e.g., foot penetration, forces, joint angles) and applies dimensionality reduction to extract relevant features, followed by a classifier to differentiate terrain types by traversability.

Result: Field tests show the classifier identifying three terrain types with approximately 97% accuracy.

Conclusion: The terrain classifier provides traversability information that can be integrated into planning to improve safety and performance on varied terrains.

Abstract: Quadrupedal mobile robots can traverse a wider range of terrain types than
their wheeled counterparts but do not perform the same on all terrain types.
These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on
challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier
that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems
to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate.
The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics
Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing
the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces,
joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality
reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then
applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on
traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain
classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy
of approximately 97%

*Otobong Jerome,Alexandr Klimchik,Alexander Maloletov,Geesara Kulathunga*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Jointly optimizes car-like kinodynamic planning to obtain a minimum-time trajectory and velocity profile, reformulating a mixed-integer fractional problem into a mixed-integer linear program using variable transformations and McCormick envelopes; reports large speedups (≈104x) over MPPI-style planners while enforcing velocity, acceleration, and steering constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, constraint-satisfying kinodynamic planning for car-like vehicles in complex 3D environments, avoiding poor local minima and producing continuous motion from a given initial state to a target state.

Method:  formulate the problem as a mixed-integer optimization: start with a mixed-integer fractional program with quadratic constraints; reformulate via a variable transformation to a mixed-integer bilinear problem; relax to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick envelopes; jointly optimize the spatial path and the sequence of acceleration and steering controls; analyze admissible control space and terrain (simplicial complex environments) to avoid local minima and ensure feasibility; ensures continuous motion from initial to final state.

Result: Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI show the proposed method generates solutions about 104 times faster while strictly adhering to the specified velocity, acceleration, and steering constraints.

Conclusion: The approach yields efficient, globally feasible minimum-time trajectories for car-like kinodynamic planning in complex 3D terrains, with substantial computational speedups; the framework is suitable for real-time planning and can be extended to address scalability and real-world deployment challenges.

Abstract: This work casts the kinodynamic planning problem for car-like vehicles as an
optimization task to compute a minimum-time trajectory and its associated
velocity profile, subject to boundary conditions on velocity, acceleration, and
steering. The approach simultaneously optimizes both the spatial path and the
sequence of acceleration and steering controls, ensuring continuous motion from
a specified initial position and velocity to a target end position and
velocity.The method analyzes the admissible control space and terrain to avoid
local minima. The proposed method operates efficiently in simplicial complex
environments, a preferred terrain representation for capturing intricate 3D
landscapes. The problem is initially posed as a mixed-integer fractional
program with quadratic constraints, which is then reformulated into a
mixed-integer bilinear objective through a variable transformation and
subsequently relaxed to a mixed-integer linear program using McCormick
envelopes. Comparative simulations against planners such as MPPI and log-MPPI
demonstrate that the proposed approach generates solutions 104 times faster
while strictly adhering to the specified constraints

*Hichem Cheriet,Khellat Kihel Badra,Chouraqui Samira*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study compares A*, RRT*, and PSO for UAV 3D urban path planning across three experiments with varying maps, altitudes, and obstacle densities. It finds A* generally offers the best computation efficiency and path quality; PSO excels in tight turns/dense environments; RRT* provides a balanced, robust performance due to its randomized search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs require reliable, efficient path planning and obstacle avoidance. While A*, RRT*, and PSO are popular, their relative strengths/weaknesses in 3D urban settings are not fully understood; benchmarking helps identify suitable algorithm choices under different environmental conditions.

Method: Three algorithms (A*, RRT*, PSO) are evaluated through three experiments, each with two scenarios, in 3D urban maps with varied size, altitude, obstacle density and size. Performance is assessed in terms of computation efficiency and path quality.

Result: A* outperforms the others in computation efficiency and path quality across the experiments. PSO is advantageous for tight turns and dense environments, while RRT* provides a balanced performance thanks to its randomized search.

Conclusion: A* is the preferred option for the tested 3D urban UAV path-planning scenarios, but each algorithm offers strengths in different environmental conditions; selection should consider map complexity and obstacle density.

Abstract: The most crucial challenges for UAVs are planning paths and avoiding
obstacles in their way. In recent years, a wide variety of path-planning
algorithms have been developed. These algorithms have successfully solved
path-planning problems; however, they suffer from multiple challenges and
limitations. To test the effectiveness and efficiency of three widely used
algorithms, namely A*, RRT*, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this paper
conducts extensive experiments in 3D urban city environments cluttered with
obstacles. Three experiments were designed with two scenarios each to test the
aforementioned algorithms. These experiments consider different city map sizes,
different altitudes, and varying obstacle densities and sizes in the
environment. According to the experimental results, the A* algorithm
outperforms the others in both computation efficiency and path quality. PSO is
especially suitable for tight turns and dense environments, and RRT* offers a
balance and works well across all experiments due to its randomized approach to
finding solutions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical DRL+fuzzy-logic framework for 4WISD autonomous navigation that uses DRL for global commands and fuzzy logic for low-level feasibility, achieving improved performance, stability, and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe, feasible, and efficient navigation for four-wheel independent steering-and-driving robots by combining learning-based decision making with rule-based control to respect kinematic constraints and prevent mechanical strain.

Method: Proposes a two-tier system: a deep reinforcement learning agent outputs global motion commands, while a fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to prevent wheel slippage and mechanical strain; validated through simulation and real-world tests in dynamic industrial environments.

Result: Outperforms traditional navigation methods, with improved training efficiency and stability; mitigates erratic DRL behavior; real-world validations demonstrate safe and effective navigation in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, reliable approach for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous
navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The
proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level
navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task
performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion
commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to
prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation
methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating
erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world
validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and
effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a
scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex,
real-world scenarios.

*Riccardo Andreoni,Andrei Buliga,Alessandro Daniele,Chiara Ghidini,Marco Montali,Massimiliano Ronzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-ILR extends the ILR neurosymbolic framework with fuzzy LTLf interpretations to directly integrate temporal logic into deep learning for sequence tasks, improving accuracy and computational efficiency on a temporal neurosymbolic image-sequence benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in integrating temporal knowledge with deep learning: existing approaches rely on explicit finite-state automata for temporal specifications, which can be limiting. A neurosymbolic approach using LTLf over finite traces could enable seamless incorporation of temporal constraints into DL architectures for sequence tasks.

Method: Proposes Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR), extending the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm with fuzzy LTLf interpretations to embed temporal logic into deep learning models. Evaluation is conducted on an image-sequence classification benchmark with temporal knowledge.

Result: T-ILR achieves improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art method on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the viability and benefits of directly incorporating temporal logic (LTLf) into deep learning via the T-ILR framework, enabling more accurate and efficient sequence-based neurosymbolic models; this opens avenues for broader temporal knowledge integration in neural architectures.

Abstract: State-of-the-art approaches for integrating symbolic knowledge with deep
learning architectures have demonstrated promising results in static domains.
However, methods to handle temporal logic specifications remain underexplored.
The only existing approach relies on an explicit representation of a
finite-state automaton corresponding to the temporal specification. Instead, we
aim at proposing a neurosymbolic framework designed to incorporate temporal
logic specifications, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces
(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

### [69] [CoFE: A Framework Generating Counterfactual ECG for Explainable Cardiac AI-Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16033)
*Jong-Hwan Jang,Junho Song,Yong-Yeon Jo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces CoFE, a counterfactual ECG framework to explain AI-ECG predictions by showing how ECG features affect decisions; validated via atrial fibrillation classification and potassium regression; aims to improve interpretability and clinical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI is needed to integrate AI-based ECG predictions into clinical practice; clinicians require transparency about which features and where they appear in ECGs influence model decisions.

Method: Proposes CounterFactual ECGs (CoFE) that perturb ECG features (amplitude, intervals) to produce counterfactual signals; apply to two case studies: AF classification and potassium level regression; assess alignment with clinical knowledge.

Result: CoFE identifies feature changes in ECGs that align with established clinical knowledge, clarifying where valid features appear and how they influence predictions.

Conclusion: The CoFE framework enhances interpretability of AI-ECG models and supports more effective clinical decision-making; a demonstration video is provided.

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

*Yiheng Hu,Xiaoyang Wang,Qing Liu,Xiwei Xu,Qian Fu,Wenjie Zhang,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free framework for multimodal multi-hop QA using an Adaptive Planning Graph with planning, retrieval, and reasoning modules. It enables dynamic, path-aware exploration without task-specific training and outperforms or matches training-based models on MultimodalQA and WebQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal multi-hop QA systems rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, making them brittle due to error propagation, and require substantial task-specific training. A training-free, adaptive approach could reduce training costs while leveraging up-to-date models.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Planning Graph with three modules: planning (decides next action and where to expand the graph), retrieval (text retrieval with modality-specific strategies), and reasoning (multimodal integration). The framework is training-free and can flexibly adapt to different data types and current models, preserving multimodal characteristics while avoiding costly task-specific training.

Result: Experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show the proposed method matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

Conclusion: A training-free, adaptive planning approach is feasible and effective for multimodal multi-hop QA, enabling dynamic exploration of reasoning paths and seamless integration with up-to-date models without extensive training.

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

### [71] [Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16054)
*Sonish Sivarajkumar,Hang Zhang,Yuelyu Ji,Maneesh Bilalpur,Xizhi Wu,Chenyu Li,Min Gu Kwak,Shyam Visweswaran,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GDP is a multimodal EHR foundation model that natively encodes structured time-series and unstructured notes, combining a CNN-Transformer encoder with a LLaMA-based decoder; trained in generative pretraining and multi-task fine-tuning to predict outcomes and generate clinical narratives, achieving strong AUROC on MIMIC-IV and high-quality narrative generation, suggesting a single model can handle both prediction and narrative tasks and can extend to more modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs are heterogeneous (structured data, unstructured notes, other modalities). Traditional approaches often serialize to text, losing temporal/quantitative detail. There is a need for a model that can jointly model multi-modal data to improve predictive performance and support documentation via narratives.

Method: GDP uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to encode structured EHR time-series and cross-modal attention to fuse with unstructured EHRs, feeding a LLaMA-based decoder. Training occurs in two stages: (1) generative pretraining (producing clinical narratives from patient timelines while performing masked feature prediction and next time-step prediction) and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission).

Result: On MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC 0.923, T2D AUROC 0.817, 30-day readmission AUROC 0.627. Narrative generation: ROUGE-L 0.135, BERTScore-F1 0.545. In blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest for faithfulness, fluency, and clinical utility.

Conclusion: A single multimodal foundation model can simultaneously achieve actionable clinical predictions and generate high-quality clinical narratives, with extensibility to additional modalities and potential to reduce documentation workload.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Urban comfort in planning is ill-defined; the paper proposes a multidimensional, data-driven, AI-assisted framework for evaluating urban comfort in digital planning, outlining gaps and directions for standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a clear definition and comprehensive evaluation framework for urban comfort as cities increasingly rely on computational planning; integrate factors like greenery, thermal comfort, and walkability.

Method: Theoretical interpretation and methodological synthesis of existing work; conceptual framework emphasizing three pillars—multidimensional analysis, data support, and AI assistance—to guide urban comfort assessment in digital planning.

Result: Proposes a conceptual framework for urban comfort assessment in digital planning, detailing the roles of multidimensional analysis, data, and AI; outlines potential indicators and methodological approaches.

Conclusion: A coherent, comprehensive evaluation framework is feasible but requires standardization, robust data, and AI-enabled tools; calls for empirical validation and guidance for urban policy and planning practice.

Abstract: Ensuring liveability and comfort is one of the fundamental objectives of
urban planning. Numerous studies have employed computational methods to assess
and quantify factors related to urban comfort such as greenery coverage,
thermal comfort, and walkability. However, a clear definition of urban comfort
and its comprehensive evaluation framework remain elusive. Our research
explores the theoretical interpretations and methodologies for assessing urban
comfort within digital planning, emphasising three key dimensions:

### [73] [Integrating Time Series into LLMs via Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion for Enhanced Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16059)
*Zhuomin Chen,Dan Li,Jiahui Zhou,Shunyu Wu,Haozheng Ye,Jian Lou,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces MSEF, a multi-layer embedding fusion approach that injects time-series representations into every layer of an LLM via steerable vectors, improving TS forecasting performance (average 31.8% MSE reduction) on seven benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on time-series information only at shallow layers, causing TS representations to fade in deeper layers and hindering alignment between textual and TS modalities. A deeper, layer-wise integration is needed to retain TS signals and enhance few-shot learning.

Method: Leverage off-the-shelf time-series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings and fuse them with intermediate text representations across LLM layers using layer-specific steering vectors that continuously optimize TS-text alignment and enable layer-wise adaptation.

Result: Experimental evaluation on seven benchmarks shows significant performance gains, with an average 31.8% reduction in MSE compared with baselines; code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: MSEF effectively allows LLMs to access time-series patterns at all depths, mitigating information loss in deeper layers and enabling efficient few-shot TS forecasting with substantial gains.

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is
available at https://github.com/One1sAll/MSEF.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InMind introduces a cognitively grounded framework to evaluate whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in social deduction games, using Avalon and 11 LLMs; findings show current LLMs rely on lexical cues and struggle to adapt, while reasoning-enhanced models show early style-sensitive reasoning; frames future cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations overlook individualized reasoning styles in social contexts; social deduction games provide a natural testbed for diverse yet valid reasoning strategies; need to assess static alignment and dynamic adaptation in LLMs.

Method: InMind augments structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections; data collected in Observer and Participant modes; defines four cognitively motivated tasks assessing static alignment and dynamic adaptation; case study Avalon with 11 state-of-the-art LLMs; compare general-purpose LLMs to reasoning-enhanced models like DeepSeek-R1.

Result: Most general-purpose LLMs rely on lexical cues and fail to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies; DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates early, style-sensitive reasoning; indicates limitations in current LLMs for individualized adaptive reasoning; InMind successfully operationalizes cognitively grounded evaluation.

Conclusion: InMind advances evaluation of cognitively aligned, individualized AI reasoning in social games and can guide future development toward adaptive, personalized LLM capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces IR-Agent, a multi-agent system for interpreting infrared spectra to elucidate molecular structures, aiming to mimic expert analysis and be extensible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IR spectroscopy is affordable and widely used, but current AI approaches struggle to capture expert reasoning and incorporate diverse chemical knowledge; there is a need for flexible, interpretable frameworks.

Method: A multi-agent framework where specialized agents handle different aspects of IR interpretation, enabling integrated reasoning and extensibility; agents collaborate to infer structures from IR data.

Result: Empirical experiments show improved baseline performance on experimental IR spectra and strong adaptability to various chemical information forms.

Conclusion: IR-Agent demonstrates improved accuracy and flexibility; the architecture supports integrating additional chemical knowledge, making it a promising direction for expert-aligned spectral analysis.

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

*Saransh Kumar Gupta,Rizwan Gulzar Mir,Lipika Dey,Partha Pratim Das,Anirban Sen,Ramesh Jain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces FCN, an ontology-based traceability network for food claims built atop Indian food knowledge graph FKG.in, using semi-automated curation, Reddit data, and LLMs to enable transparent, provenance-aware validation; demonstrated via a proof-of-concept; adaptable to other settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented infrastructure to trace, verify, and contextualize food claims. A transparent, explainable knowledge base is needed to help researchers, policymakers, and consumers, leveraging an existing Indian food knowledge graph.

Method: Design an ontology and extend FKG.in to create FCN; implement a semi-automated knowledge curation workflow; use structured schemas and provenance-aware pipelines for extracting and validating food-related claims from Reddit data with Large Language Models; application-agnostic.

Result: Proof-of-concept of FKG.in-FCN showing feasibility: integrated data inputs, schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for claim extraction and validation using Reddit data and LLMs.

Conclusion: Modeling food claims with traceability in a structured, verifiable, and explainable manner can promote transparent, accountable food knowledge ecosystems. The approach is adaptable to different geographic, culinary, or regulatory settings and supports researchers, policymakers, and consumers.

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

*Ruiqi Wu,Yuang Yao,Tengfei Ma,Chenran Zhang,Na Su,Tao Zhou,Geng Chen,Wen Fan,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes MM-Retinal-Reason, a ophthalmology-focused multimodal reasoning dataset, and OphthaReason, an MLLM that uses step-by-step reasoning traces and Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) to handle basic and complex reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on both task types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where medical multimodal models mainly perform basic visual reasoning and ignore the broader clinical information integration and step-by-step reasoning used in real-world ophthalmology, enabling more realistic clinical thinking and traceable decision processes.

Method: Create MM-Retinal-Reason with basic and complex reasoning tasks; develop OphthaReason with interpretable step-by-step reasoning traces; introduce Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT) that estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and adjusts exploration depth with a shaped advantage mechanism.

Result: OphthaReason achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92%, 15.00%, 21.20%, and 17.66%.

Conclusion: First ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with trackable reasoning traces; the MM-Retinal-Reason dataset and UADT method enable flexible adaptation to tasks of varying complexity and bring ophthalmology-focused multimodal reasoning closer to real clinical thinking.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

*Kai Hu,Parfait Atchade-Adelomou,Carlo Adornetto,Adrian Mora-Carrero,Luis Alonso-Pastor,Ariel Noyman,Yubo Liu,Kent Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Preference Chain integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to improve context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation; it better matches real-world mode choices than standard LLMs on the Replica dataset; highlights potential for emerging-city mobility modeling; limitations include slow inference and possible hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of simulating human behavior in data-scarce urban environments where traditional data-driven models struggle; aims to overcome inconsistencies and lack of context in purely LLM-based agents by grounding outputs with graph-based retrieval.

Method: Introduces the Preference Chain architecture that combines Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation with large language models to create a Mobility Agent; uses the Replica dataset to assess alignment with real-world transportation mode choices; emphasizes context-sensitive retrieval to guide generation.

Result: The Preference Chain outperforms standard LLMs in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices on the Replica dataset; demonstrates applicability to urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting; notes limitations including slow inference and risk of hallucination.

Conclusion: The framework presents a promising approach for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments and could support urban mobility planning and forecasting in emerging cities, despite current limitations.

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

*João Abrantes,Robert Tjarko Lange,Yujin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M2N2 is an evolutionary algorithm for model merging that dynamically adjusts merging boundaries, preserves diversity, and uses a heuristic attraction metric to fuse models, enabling from-scratch evolution and scalable performance boosts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging relies on fixed parameter partitions, limiting exploration of combinations and potential performance gains. There is a need for more flexible, scalable merging that can evolve novel models from diverse sources while maintaining capabilities.

Method: M2N2 introduces (1) dynamic merging boundaries that expand parameter grouping during search; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism inspired by natural resource competition to keep a diverse, high-performing population; (3) a heuristic-based attraction metric to select promising model pairs for fusion. It applies the approach to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch and scales to specialized language and image-generation models, comparing against CMA-ES and achieving state-of-the-art results with higher efficiency.

Result: Empirically, M2N2 can evolve models from scratch and reach performance comparable to CMA-ES on MNIST while being more computationally efficient. It scales to merge specialized language and image-generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The approach also preserves important model capabilities not explicitly optimized by the fitness function, indicating robustness.

Conclusion: M2N2 provides a robust, versatile framework for model merging that enables from-scratch evolution and scalable merging of diverse models, with strong performance and preserved capabilities. The work demonstrates practical applicability and includes a public code repository.

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

*Alexandru Tugui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GROW-AI offers a six-criterion, game-based maturity assessment for AI, using an AI Journal and weighted averages to yield a Grow Up Index, enabling traceable, cross-type maturity profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer whether machines can 'grow up' and extend evaluation beyond the Turing Test by providing a unified, interdisciplinary framework for measuring AI maturity.

Method: Six criteria (C1–C6) are evaluated through specific games across four arenas. All decisions/actions are recorded in an AI Journal. Initial weights are set by the prior expert method. The Grow Up Index is the arithmetic mean of the six scores, interpreted via maturity thresholds.

Result: The framework enables coherent, comparable assessments of AI maturity across types (robots, software agents, LLMs). The multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerabilities, and the journal ensures traceability and replicability.

Conclusion: GROW-AI offers a novel conceptual transposition of human growth to AI within an integrated testing format that merges psychology, robotics, computer science, and ethics, capturing both performance and the evolutionary path toward maturity.

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards
maturity.

*Wen-Han Hsieh,Elvis Hsieh,Dantong Niu,Trevor Darrell,Roei Herzig,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified IVA framework detects false-premise instructions in Vision-Language-Action models, requests clarification, and grounds viable alternatives, achieving large gains in false-premise handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA systems assume instruction validity; false premises can cause task failure and poor user trust. A robust handling mechanism improves reliability and user intent interpretation.

Method: Introduce Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA): detect false premises, engage in language-based clarification or correction, and ground plausible alternatives in perception and action. Build a large-scale instruction-tuning setup with structured prompts and train a VLA model on both accurate and erroneous requests. Use a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing paired positive and false-premise instructions to enable robust detection and correction.

Result: IVA substantially improves performance in false-premise scenarios: false-premise detection accuracy up by 97.56% over baselines and successful responses in false-premise cases up by 50.78%. Also demonstrates a scalable approach via large-scale instruction tuning and semi-synthetic data.

Conclusion: IVA enhances robustness and reliability of Vision-Language-Action systems when faced with false-premise instructions by detecting false premises, clarifying user intent, and grounding alternatives in perception and action.

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

*Nasir Khan,Asmaa Abdallah,Abdulkadir Celik,Ahmed M. Eltawil,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A causally-aware deep learning framework for mmWave MIMO beam alignment that uses causal discovery to select a minimal set of inputs, achieving comparable performance with substantially lower input selection time and beam sweeping overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based beam alignment often ignores causal relationships, leading to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and higher beam sweeping overhead in mmWave systems. A causally-informed approach aims to improve efficiency and robustness for 6G-era beam management.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) causal discovery learns a Bayesian graph that captures dependencies between received power inputs and the optimal beam; (2) this graph guides causal feature selection for the downstream DL-based classifier, reducing input features to only causally relevant ones.

Result: Simulation results show the causal beam selection matches the performance of conventional methods while dramatically reducing input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4%.

Conclusion: Integrating causal discovery into beam management yields an efficient, interpretable DL-based beam alignment framework that maintains performance while substantially reducing overhead by focusing on causally relevant features.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

TL;DR: GLARE is an agentic legal reasoning framework that dynamically acquires legal knowledge via modular components, improving the breadth and depth of legal judgment prediction (LJP). It is validated on a real-world dataset and yields an interpretable reasoning chain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with sufficient legal reasoning due to a lack of specialized legal knowledge, limiting their breadth, depth, and interpretability in LJP tasks.

Method: Propose GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning framework that dynamically invokes different modules to acquire key legal knowledge, expanding reasoning capabilities. It generates a reasoning chain to enhance transparency and interpretability while enabling practical applications. Experimental validation is conducted on a real-world dataset.

Result: Experiments validate the effectiveness of GLARE in improving legal reasoning and show that the generated reasoning chain increases interpretability, offering potential for practical real-world applications.

Conclusion: GLARE demonstrates that an agentic, modular approach can overcome knowledge gaps in LLMs for legal reasoning, delivering more capable, interpretable, and practically useful LJP systems; suggests future work on expanding module coverage and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) has become increasingly important in the
legal field. In this paper, we identify that existing large language models
(LLMs) have significant problems of insufficient reasoning due to a lack of
legal knowledge. Therefore, we introduce GLARE, an agentic legal reasoning
framework that dynamically acquires key legal knowledge by invoking different
modules, thereby improving the breadth and depth of reasoning. Experiments
conducted on the real-world dataset verify the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, the reasoning chain generated during the analysis process can
increase interpretability and provide the possibility for practical
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoDER introduces a modular framework to enhance zero-shot capabilities in vision-language-model-based continual learning by composing textual experts specialized for seen classes into refined prototypes for unseen classes, evaluated across 14 datasets on Class-IL and MTIL; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual-learning approaches mostly aim to preserve zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained VLMs during incremental fine-tuning. The work argues for actively enhancing zero-shot generalization by modular, recomposed textual knowledge, enabling better adaptation to unseen classes without sacrificing Y-shots.

Method: Train multiple textual experts, each specialized to a seen class, and store them in a foundational hub. At inference, for each unseen class, retrieve relevant experts from the hub and compose them to synthesize a refined prototype for improved classification within zero-shot incremental protocols (Class-IL and MTIL).

Result: Evidence of effectiveness across two zero-shot incremental protocols (Class-IL and MTIL) on 14 datasets, demonstrating enhanced zero-shot generalization when using MoDER, with code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: MoDER validates that modular textual recomposition can enhance zero-shot capabilities in continual learning with vision-language models, offering improved generalization to unseen classes. This approach introduces additional modularity and retrieval/composition dynamics, with potential trade-offs in complexity and hub design.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

*Xuan Zhang,Zhijian Zhou,Weidi Xu,Yanting Miao,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based neuro-symbolic framework that learns logical constraints via a two-stage training process and a diffusion-based MDP refined with PPO, achieving strong logical consistency on classic symbolic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with symbolic reasoning and strict logical constraints. The paper proposes leveraging diffusion models to guide outputs toward symbolic feasibility, enabling neural systems to solve logical puzzles by enforcing constraints during learning.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage 1 cultivates basic reasoning; Stage 2 learns logical constraints by treating the diffusion process as a Markov decision process and fine-tuning with an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO). A rule-based reward signals logical consistency, guiding policy optimization. Evaluation on Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding, and preference learning benchmarks.

Result: The approach achieves outstanding accuracy and strong logical consistency across neural models on the tested symbolic benchmarks.

Conclusion: A diffusion-based neuro-symbolic framework with PPO-driven hard-constraint enforcement can effectively learn and apply symbolic rules, offering a promising direction for integrating neural and symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

TL;DR: A competitor-discovery agent for drug asset diligence achieves 83% recall on a custom production benchmark, outperforming peers, and reduces analyst turnaround time by ~20x in a biotech VC setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no public benchmark for competitor drug-name retrieval in diligence workflows; data are paywalled, fragmented, and alias-heavy; rapid, accurate extraction of competitive landscapes is essential for investor decisions and enterprise risk management.

Method: Develop a competitor-discovery AI agent that retrieves all drugs in a given competitive landscape, builds a structured, normalized attribute map, and uses a dedicated LLM-as-a-judge to filter false positives; create a benchmark by converting five years of unstructured diligence memos into a structured corpus mapping indications to drugs; evaluate recall against baselines and deploy in production with enterprise users; conduct a case study with a biotech VC.

Result: The agent achieves 83% recall, outperforming OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%); production deployment reduces analyst turnaround from 2.5 days to ~3 hours (~20x) for competitive analysis.

Conclusion: The approach yields high recall with practical enterprise value, demonstrates the feasibility of benchmarking for this task using real-world diligence data, and shows substantial efficiency gains and risk mitigation through a judge component to curb hallucinations.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

TL;DR: Z-Pruner is a post-training pruning method that induces sparsity in pretrained LLMs without retraining by leveraging weight update magnitudes and activation patterns, outperforming prior pruning methods on LLMs like LLaMA-2/3 and OPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce model size, inference latency, and energy usage of large language models without costly retraining, addressing limitations of existing pruning methods that degrade performance or require fine-tuning.

Method: Post-training pruning (no retraining) that uses both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify redundant parameters, resulting in a model-agnostic, efficient pruning approach widely applicable to LLMs.

Result: Z-Pruner surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that rely on weight updates, achieving the lowest perplexity and highest average zero-shot accuracy across LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT benchmarks; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Z-Pruner offers an effective, retraining-free pruning solution that reduces model size and inference cost while preserving performance across popular LLM architectures, with broad practical applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

*Bin Wen,Tien-Ping Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PGF-Net introduces a Progressive Gated-Fusion framework for efficient, interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis. It uses Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion with cross-attention to fuse audio-visual features into textual representations within Transformer layers, an Adaptive Gated Arbitration to balance linguistic vs multimodal context, and a hybrid PEFT strategy (LoRA + Post-Fusion Adapters) for parameter efficiency. A hierarchical encoder enables deep fusion, achieving state-of-the-art MOSI results (MAE 0.691, F1 86.9%) with only 3.09M trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deep, context-aware fusion of non-linguistic (audio/visual) cues with text in a Transformer-based sentiment analysis model while keeping the model lightweight and interpretable, addressing noise sensitivity and resource constraints.

Method: 1) Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion: Cross-Attention within Transformer layers queries and integrates audio/visual features into textual representations for deeper fusion. 2) Adaptive Gated Arbitration: dynamic controller balancing original textual information and fused multimodal context to stabilize integration and reduce noise. 3) Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): combines global LoRA adaptation with local Post-Fusion Adapters for efficient training. Implemented in a hierarchical encoder architecture.

Result: On MOSI, achieves state-of-the-art performance with MAE of 0.691 and F1-Score of 86.9% using only 3.09M trainable parameters, demonstrating strong performance with high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: PGF-Net delivers deep, dynamic, and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis with strong performance and lightweight training requirements. The three innovations collectively enable effective fusion, stability, and efficiency, making the approach suitable for resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our

*Muhammad Fathur Rohman Sidiq,Abdurrouf,Didik Rahadi Santoso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight ECG segmentation model combines spectral analysis with probabilistic predictions, replacing heavy layers like BiLSTM. It integrates Explainable AI and physics-based AI for interpretability, achieving high P, QRS, T segmentation accuracy with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient, accurate ECG segmentation without complex architectures, and to improve interpretability through XAI and physics-informed AI.

Method: Use spectral-domain analysis with simple layers to capture temporal and spectral features of P, QRS, and T waves; output probabilistic segmentations; apply Explainable AI to attribute decisions to temporal and frequency features; incorporate physics-based AI principles to enhance transparency.

Result: Segmentation accuracies reported: QRS 97.00%, T 93.33%, P 96.07%, with claimed improvements in computational efficiency over multi-layer architectures like BiLSTM.

Conclusion: The approach offers high-accuracy ECG wave segmentation with lower model complexity and enhanced interpretability, making it suitable for practical heart signal monitoring.

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

### [91] [TPLA: Tensor Parallel Latent Attention for Efficient Disaggregated Prefill \& Decode Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15881)
*Xiaojuan Tang,Fanxu Meng,Pingzhi Tang,Yuxuan Wang,Di Yin,Xing Sun,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA) enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding with MLA-style latent key-value caching by partitioning the latent representation and per-head inputs across devices, performing per-shard attention, and then aggregating results. It preserves MLA's cached KV benefits while unlocking tensor-parallel speedups (~1.8–1.9x) at long contexts, with MLA drop-in compatibility and optional orthogonal transforms to further reduce cross-shard interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLA compresses KV caches to a low-rank latent vector, but in tensor parallelism each device must load the full cache, eroding MLA's memory/time advantages. A TP-friendly scheme is needed that preserves the compressed cache benefits and maintains rich representational capacity without retraining.

Method: Propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): partition both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices; compute attention independently on each shard; combine shard outputs via an all-reduce. TPLA keeps the full latent representation per head (unlike GLA), is drop-in compatible with MLA-pretrained models (supports MLA-style prefilling and tensor-parallel decoding without retraining). Optional orthogonal transforms (e.g., Hadamard, PCA) before TP slicing reduce cross-shard interference. Implementable with FlashAttention-3 for practical acceleration.

Result: By reducing per-device KV cache in DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, TPLA achieves 1.79x and 1.93x speedups at a 32K-token context length, with performance preserved on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. Orthogonal transforms yield minimal additional accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: TPLA preserves MLA’s latent-cache benefits while enabling efficient tensor-parallel processing. It remains drop-in compatible with MLA, supports MLA-prefilling, requires no retraining, and can deliver practical end-to-end acceleration (e.g., via FlashAttention-3).

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

*Jihua Huang,Yi Yao,Ajay Divakaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based temporal causal discovery framework linking nonlinear temporal dependencies to an inferred causal graph with lag estimates; uses attention masking to reduce spurious links, achieving strong gains in F1 and lag accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear dependencies and spurious correlations in time-series impede reliable causal discovery; need robust methods that capture long-range effects and incorporate prior knowledge.

Method: Train a multi-layer Transformer forecaster to model long-range nonlinear temporal relationships; derive causal structure and lags from gradient-based analysis of the trained model; apply attention-masking to enforce user-specified priors across layers.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art: 12.8% higher F1-score for causal discovery; 98.9% accuracy in estimating causal lags.

Conclusion: Shows that integrating deep forecasting with gradient-based causal extraction and prior-attention yields accurate causal graphs while mitigating spurious causality in complex time-series.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

TL;DR: A critical review of high-dimensional embeddings that synthesizes developments, proposes best practices, benchmarks methods across datasets, and outlines open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of high-dimensional data across fields has led to many embedding methods but a fragmented literature; practitioners lack guidance.

Method: Detailed review, synthesis of best practices, empirical evaluation on multiple datasets, and discussion of open problems.

Result: A set of best practices for creating/using embeddings; comparative evaluation insights; identification of strengths/weaknesses of popular methods; articulated challenges and gaps.

Conclusion: Need for coherence, standardized evaluation, and continued research to address open problems and implementation details.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the
field.

### [94] [An Efficient Hybridization of Graph Representation Learning and Metaheuristics for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15949)
*Bruna C. B. Charytitsch,María C. V. Nascimento*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Graph Representation Learning-guided GRASP (GL-GRASP) approach for the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP) uses cheaper learning to guide the GRASP construction, achieving superior primal-integral performance and scalability, especially with deep learning embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to combine fast, learning-based insights with metaheuristics to improve graph drawing decisions without incurring the high cost of supervised or reinforcement learning, addressing the C-IGDP where GRASP has shown promise.

Method: Integrate Graph Representation Learning into the GRASP construction phase, creating GL-GRASP. Investigate multiple node-embedding techniques (notably deep learning-based methods) and evaluate using the primal integral measure on varying instance densities under fixed time limits.

Result: GL-GRASP heuristics outperform state-of-the-art GRASP methods for C-IGDP in the primal integral sense, with a robustness demonstration on denser instances under a fixed time budget.

Conclusion: Incorporating Graph Representation Learning into the GRASP construction phase yields superior performance and robustness for C-IGDP, highlighting the effectiveness of deep learning embeddings in guiding combinatorial graph drawing heuristics.

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Onboard ML-based wheel flange wear-depth monitoring using displacement and temperature sensors, with FFT-informed IIR noise filtering, achieving ~98% accuracy and real-time operation in a railway IoT setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rail safety demands accurate, real-time wear monitoring of wheel flanges; sensor readings are affected by temperature and vehicle dynamics, necessitating robust regression-based estimation and noise mitigation.

Method: Lab-based experiments simulate wear depth and temperature variations; collect displacement and temperature data; train regression models (dynamic ML) for wear-depth estimation; design and apply an IIR filter (FFT-informed) to reduce vehicle dynamics and sensor noise; integrate with onboard railway IoT/embedded systems.

Result: ML regression counters temperature-induced nonlinearity with 96.5% accuracy and minimal runtime; IIR noise reduction improves accuracy to 98.2%; overall system validated with standard procedures and suitable for real-time monitoring.

Conclusion: The approach provides real-time, accurate wear-depth insights and track-condition indications, enhancing railway safety and efficiency; feasible for deployment within onboard IoT-enabled monitoring architectures.

Abstract: Rail and wheel interaction functionality is pivotal to the railway system
safety, requiring accurate measurement systems for optimal safety monitoring
operation. This paper introduces an innovative onboard measurement system for
monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents an adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination policy for contextual bandits with vector rewards under distribution shift, introduces preference-based regret based on Pareto-front distance, and provides upper bounds that generalize no-shift results and scale with problem parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distribution shift in contextual bandits with vector-valued rewards by introducing a Pareto-front based performance metric and a self-tuning policy that adapts to shift.

Method: Proposes an adaptive-discretization scheme combined with optimistic elimination (UCB-like) that self-tunes to the underlying distribution shift and uses a preference cone to order rewards. Defines preference-based regret as the distance between Pareto fronts.

Result: Derives upper bounds on preference-based regret under various shift assumptions, showing the bounds generalize existing results for static/no-shift and vector-valued reward settings and scale gracefully with problem parameters under shift.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, shift-aware bandit policy and a meaningful regret metric; the framework extends to broader shift scenarios and highlights the utility of Pareto-front based performance analysis.

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep Equilibrium Propagation (EP) framework is proposed that uses intermediate error signals and knowledge distillation to overcome vanishing gradients in deep EP networks, enabling scalable training and achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10/100 with deep VGG architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EP offers a local, biologically inspired alternative to BPTT but struggles with deep networks due to vanishing gradients, limiting scalability for on-chip neuromorphic training. The goal is to extend EP’s applicability to deeper architectures and real-world datasets.

Method: Introduce intermediate error signals within EP to improve information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics, and integrate knowledge distillation with local error signals into EP to facilitate training of significantly deeper networks.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and shows scalability of EP to deep VGG architectures, marking a major step toward practical deep EP training.

Conclusion: The framework substantially extends the scalability and practicality of EP for deep neural networks, reducing vanishing gradient issues and enabling on-chip, neuromorphic-compatible deep learning on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mathematical foundations for Cartan neural networks: layers as non-compact symmetric spaces with solvable homomorphisms; automorphic forms, tilings, and spinor representations underpin new geometric neural constructs; concrete results include separators for U/H, Delta_{8,3,2} tiling group with uniformizations of genus 3 Fermat quartic and genus 2 Bolza surface; new Green's function/heat kernel representations on H^n; proposed Abel–Jacobi/Siegel theta route to Laplacian eigenfunctions on Bolza.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify diverse mathematical results to support a geometric, symmetry-driven architecture for neural networks; establish a rigorous foundation for TS vector bundles and harmonic analysis on non-compact symmetric spaces; enable explicit spectral constructions aligned with neural computation.

Method: Group-theoretic constructions of separators for non-compact symmetric spaces U/H; analysis of tiling groups Delta_{8,3,2} and normal Fuchsian subgroups; uniformization of specified Riemann surfaces; study of quotient automorphic groups; derive new representations of Laplacian Green function and heat kernel on hyperbolic spaces; develop spinor-based harmonic function framework; propose Abel-Jacobi map and Siegel theta-based eigenfunction construction.

Result: Definite results: separators for all U/H; Delta_{8,3,2} tiling group and normal Fuchsian subgroups; uniformizations for Fermat quartic (g=3) and Bolza (g=2); new Green function and heat kernel representations; harmonic function setup via spinor representations; partial result/conjecture: Laplacian eigenfunctions on Bolza via Abel-Jacobi to Jacobian and Siegel theta.

Conclusion: Lays rigorous groundwork to realize Cartan neural networks with geometry-inspired layers; combines group theory, automorphic forms, and Riemann surface theory; some aspects remain conjectural, but the framework offers concrete avenues for spectral neural representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A MARL framework (PAC-MCoFL) for federated learning across multiple SPs that achieves Pareto-optimal equilibria by combining Pareto Actor-Critic with expectile regression, using TCAD for high-dimensional actions and a scalable PAC-MCoFL-p variant; supports convergence guarantees and shows empirical gains in total reward and hypervolume over current MARL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-SP FL, non-cooperative behavior and privacy constraints hinder centralized optimization of resource allocation and client assignment. There is a need for decentralized, risk-aware, Pareto-efficient strategies that scale with data heterogeneity and deployment size.

Method: Introduce PAC-MCoFL: SPs as agents coordinating client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Combine Pareto Actor-Critic with expectile regression to model heterogeneous risk profiles and target Pareto-optimal equilibria. Employ ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) to manage high-dimensional action spaces. Propose PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant with a parameterized conjecture generator that reduces computation with provable bounded error. Provide theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Simulation results show PAC-MCoFL improves total reward by ~5.8% and Hypervolume Indicator (HVI) by ~4.2% over the latest MARL solutions, and demonstrates better balance between individual SP performance and system-level performance in large-scale deployments with data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: PAC-MCoFL offers a principled, scalable framework for Pareto-efficient MARL in privacy-aware multi-SP FL settings, with convergence guarantees and empirical gains. The scalable PAC-MCoFL-p variant reduces computational burden while maintaining bounded error.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces nonstationary discriminant analysis by embedding LDA/QDA within state-space models, using Kalman smoothing (with EM and GMM-Kalman extensions) and particle smoothing to handle time-varying drift; demonstrates improvements over stationary methods and robustness to noise, missing data, and imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical discriminant analysis assumes IID data, but class-conditional distributions drift over time, making stationary classifiers unreliable. A principled, model-based framework is needed to handle temporal distribution shift.

Method: Embed discriminant analysis in state-space models to obtain NSLDA/NSQDA. For linear-Gaussian dynamics, adapt Kalman smoothing to multiple samples per time step. Develop: (i) EM approach to jointly estimate unknown system parameters; (ii) GMM-Kalman method to recover unobserved time labels and parameters. For nonlinear/non-Gaussian drift, use particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully nonstationary discriminant rules.

Result: Extensive simulations show consistent improvements over stationary LDA, QDA, and SVM baselines. The methods are robust to noise, missing data, and class imbalance.

Conclusion: Presents a unified, data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under temporal distribution shift through model-based nonstationary discriminant analysis.

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

TL;DR: One-epoch finetuning task vectors are exactly the negative gradient scaled by the learning rate; multi-epoch finetuning yields approximate equivalence with a bounded second-order error. This explains why task arithmetic often works and highlights early training dynamics as crucial for model merging.

Motivation: There is a lack of theoretical understanding of why task arithmetic works and when it is reliable. The work seeks to ground task merging in gradient dynamics and provide conditions under which task vectors align with gradients.

Method: Theoretically derive the relation between task vectors from finetuning and gradients of the loss under standard gradient descent; bound the second-order error for multi-epoch training in feed-forward networks; empirically validate on seven vision benchmarks to compare gradient norms/directions with the finetuning trajectory.

Result: For one epoch, a task vector is exactly the negative gradient scaled by the learning rate. For multi-epoch training, the equivalence holds approximately with a provable second-order error bound in feed-forward nets. Empirically, the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning path in norm and direction, and merging single-epoch finetuned models often approaches the performance of merging fully converged models.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic is reframed as approximate multitask learning: early training dynamics drive model merging effectiveness, explaining when and why merging with early-stage finetuned models works and highlighting its limitations.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

### [103] [GPLight+: A Genetic Programming Method for Learning Symmetric Traffic Signal Control Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16090)
*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GP with a symmetric phase-urgency function improves traffic signal policies on CityFlow vs traditional GP, yielding more effective, interpretable, and deployable rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GP-based methods struggle to consistently handle shared traffic features across different phase components. A symmetric, shared-structure urgency representation can unify treatment of phase turns and improve generalization and interpretability.

Method: Introduce a symmetric phase urgency function formed as the aggregation of two shared subtrees representing turn urgencies within a phase. Use genetic programming to evolve this function. Evaluate on CityFlow simulator using multiple real-world datasets; compare against traditional GP representations; assess policy effectiveness, interpretability, and deployability.

Result: The symmetric urgency representation significantly improves learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation across a wide range of scenarios. Policies are effective, human-understandable, and easily deployable.

Conclusion: Enforcing symmetry and shared subtrees for phase urgency leads to more consistent feature treatment, better GP performance, and practical, deployable traffic signal policies; suggests a productive direction for GP-based traffic control research.

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

*Ayyüce Begüm Bektaş,Mithat Gönen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that machine learning in high-stakes medical domains must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible, and accountable, and outlines concrete strategies to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes medical decisions require trusted, transparent, and regulatory-compliant AI. Privacy and data sharing across institutions are major barriers to progress.

Method: Proposes intrinsically interpretable modeling approaches (e.g., kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based learning, deep kernel models) as alternatives to opaque deep nets, and discusses accountability practices. It also advocates privacy-preserving collaboration via generative AI and distributed learning (federated learning, diffusion-based data synthesis) to enable reproducible, cross-institutional research.

Result: A conceptual framework and design criteria aiming to make medical AI interpretable, auditable, and shareable, with proposed modeling approaches and collaboration paradigms; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Reframing ML foundations around interpretability, accountability, and reproducibility—along with privacy-preserving collaboration—can yield medical AI that is accurate, transparent, trustworthy, and translatable to real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

### [105] [CommonKV: Compressing KV Cache with Cross-layer Parameter Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16134)
*Yixuan Wang,Haoyu Qiao,Lujun Li,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free cross-layer KV cache compression (CommonKV) using adjacent-parameter sharing via SVD, with cosine-similarity-based adaptive budgeting; outperforms prior methods and enables very high compression with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer memory bottlenecks from growing KV caches; existing cross-layer KV sharing either requires architecture modification/pretraining or degrades performance at high compression; a training-free, effective compression method is needed.

Method: Apply SVD-based weight sharing across adjacent parameters to create a more mergeable latent KV cache; introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy driven by cosine similarity to avoid over-compressing dissimilar caches; demonstrate compatibility with quantization and eviction methods.

Result: Consistent improvements over low-rank and cross-layer baselines across multiple backbones and benchmarks (LongBench, Ruler) at various compression ratios; high compression (up to 98%) with minimal performance loss when combined with other methods; benefits are orthogonal to other quantization/eviction techniques.

Conclusion: CommonKV provides a training-free, effective cross-layer KV cache compression approach that is scalable and complementary to other compression techniques, enabling substantial memory reductions with preserved performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micromobility is vital for urban transport and faces data, safety, and efficiency challenges. There is a gap in literature on ML-specific applications for micromobilities, motivating a consolidated review.

Method: Systematic review of micromobility datasets, ML models, and applications. The paper categorizes data by spatial/temporal/feature characteristics, surveys ML approaches, discusses use cases (demand, energy, safety), and outlines future research directions.

Result: Provides a structured synthesis of available datasets and ML techniques in micromobility, identifies key application areas and challenges, and highlights gaps and best practices for future work.

Conclusion: Future work should advance data standards, scalable ML methods, and user-centric approaches to improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in micromobility systems.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of
micromobilities requires optimisation of complex systems for efficiency,
environmental impact mitigation, and overcoming technical challenges for user
safety. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been crucial to support these
advancements and to address their unique challenges. However, there is
insufficient literature addressing the specific issues of ML applications in
micromobilities. This survey paper addresses this gap by providing a
comprehensive review of datasets, ML techniques, and their specific
applications in micromobilities. Specifically, we collect and analyse various
micromobility-related datasets and discuss them in terms of spatial, temporal,
and feature-based characteristics. In addition, we provide a detailed overview
of ML models applied in micromobilities, introducing their advantages,
challenges, and specific use cases. Furthermore, we explore multiple ML
applications, such as demand prediction, energy management, and safety,
focusing on improving efficiency, accuracy, and user experience. Finally, we
propose future research directions to address these issues, aiming to help
future researchers better understand this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A memory-augmented online RL framework for adaptive LLM agents that operates without gradient updates, using episodic memory (differentiable or non-parametric) and a neural case-selection policy within a Memory-augmented MDP (M-MDP). AgentFly achieves strong GAIA and DeepResearcher performance, with notable OOD gains, and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the rigidity and computational cost of fine-tuning LLMs and static reflection workflows; enable continual, low-cost adaptation for generalist LLM agents.

Method: Formalize memory-based continual learning as a Memory-augmented MDP with a neural case-selection policy, episodic memory, and memory rewriting; efficient retrieval-based policy improvement; instantiate as AgentFly in deep research tasks.

Result: AgentFly achieves top-1 GAIA validation 87.88% Pass@3, 79.40% on GAIA test; 66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on DeepResearcher; outperforms training-based methods; case-based memory yields 4.7-9.6 percentage points on OOD tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable, real-time continual learning for generalist LLM agents without gradient updates, advancing open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios; code available.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

### [108] [On the Collapse Errors Induced by the Deterministic Sampler for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16154)
*Yi Zhang,Zhenyu Liao,Jingfeng Wu,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deterministic diffusion samplers exhibit collapse errors where samples concentrate in local data space; a new metric quantifies this, revealing a see-saw between low- and high-noise score learning; empirical evidence links deterministic dynamics and high-noise misfit to collapse, calling for new studies on learning-sampling interplay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover a largely overlooked limitation of ODE-based, deterministic diffusion sampling and understand why samples can collapse to restricted regions of data space. This motivates better training-sampling strategies and architectural choices.

Method: Introduce a novel metric to quantify collapse errors; examine its behavior across varying settings; identify a see-saw effect between score learning in low-noise and high-noise regimes; diagnose collapse as a result of high-noise misfit combined with deterministic sampler dynamics; validate with empirical experiments using established sampling, training, and architectural techniques.

Result: Collapse errors are observed across diverse settings in ODE-based diffusion sampling. A high-noise regime misfit, coupled with deterministic sampler dynamics, drives samples to cluster in local data space. The proposed metric effectively detects these errors, and empirical studies corroborate the proposed explanation, highlighting the coupling between score learning and sampling dynamics.

Conclusion: There is a need for deeper study of the score-learning and deterministic-sampling interplay to mitigate collapse errors. Future work should explore training and architectural adjustments, alternative sampling schemes, or regularization strategies to reduce this collapse and improve the diversity and fidelity of samples.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STA-GANN is a GNN-based spatio-temporal kriging framework designed to handle missing sensors by ensuring valid and generalizable inferred spatio-temporal patterns. It introduces a Decoupled Phase Module for timestamp shifts, Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relations with temporal data/metadata, and an adversarial transfer learning strategy for generalization, validated across nine datasets from four fields with theoretical support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete data from missing or inaccessible sensors leads to gaps in spatio-temporal data and challenges in inferring accurate temporal information. Existing models struggle to maintain validity and generalizability of inferred patterns, particularly with dynamic spatial dependencies, temporal shifts, and unknown sensors.

Method: Propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a GNN-based kriging framework consisting of (i) a Decoupled Phase Module to sense/adjust timestamp shifts, (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relations using temporal data and metadata, and (iii) an adversarial transfer learning strategy to promote generalizability across unseen sensors, validated across multiple datasets.

Result: Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields shows superior performance in generating valid spatio-temporal patterns and improving generalization, supported by theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: STA-GANN advances spatio-temporal kriging by explicitly addressing timestamp shifts, evolving spatial relationships, and cross-domain generalization, yielding more accurate and generalizable inferrals of missing temporal information.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

*Shengyu Feng,Zhiqing Sun,Yiming Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPL-LNS is a sampling-enhanced neural LNS that uses locally-informed proposals and hindsight relabeling to escape local optima and improve sample efficiency in ILP; it outperforms previous neural LNS methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural LNS for ILP often relies on greedy proposals that risk getting stuck in local optima and can be sample-inefficient over long runs; addressing these issues is essential for scalable performance.

Method: Formulate LNS as a stochastic process; introduce SPL-LNS with locally-informed proposals to escape local optima; develop hindsight relabeling to train SPL-LNS on self-generated data.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows SPL-LNS substantially outperforms prior neural LNS solvers across various ILP problems and sizes.

Conclusion: Locally-informed stochastic search with hindsight relabeling improves both solution quality and sample efficiency, making neural LNS more robust for ILPs.

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

TL;DR: A MI-EEG classification method using MiniRocket features with a linear classifier, outperforming a CNN-LSTM baseline in accuracy and achieving high efficiency on PhysioNet data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MI-EEG is nonstationary and variable across individuals with many classes, making accurate, efficient classification challenging. The work aims to improve accuracy and reduce computation by exploring a lightweight feature extractor (MiniRocket) plus a linear classifier, and benchmarking against a CNN-LSTM baseline.

Method: Extract features using Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket) and classify with a linear classifier. Additionally, develop a CNN-LSTM deep learning baseline. Evaluate on the PhysioNet MI-EEG dataset, comparing accuracy and computational cost.

Result: MiniRocket features yield a mean accuracy of 98.63%; the CNN-LSTM baseline achieves 98.06%. MiniRocket demonstrates higher performance and lower computational cost compared to the deep learning model.

Conclusion: MiniRocket-based feature extraction with a linear classifier can significantly enhance MI-EEG accuracy and efficiency, offering new insights into feature extraction/classification for motor imagery EEG.

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

*Sungmin Kang,Jisoo Kim,Salman Avestimehr,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM is a scale-aware, sparse fine-tuning method that uses Gradient-to-Weight Ratio and entropy-guided masking to selectively update a tiny fraction of parameters, achieving improvements over full fine-tuning on both general and domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PEFT often updates many parameters without considering their original scale, which can yield limited behavioral change. There is a need to account for parameter scale and allocate updates efficiently across layers.

Method: Compute gradient-to-weight ratio to prioritize updates proportional to initial parameter values. Use entropy of parameter values per layer to determine how many parameters to tune in that layer. Apply masking to sparsify updates accordingly, yielding GEM.

Result: On GLUE and SuperGLUE (general-domain) and GSM8k and MBPP (domain-specific), GEM achieves up to 1.6% absolute improvement in fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of parameters.

Conclusion: A parameter scale-aware, distribution-sensitive PEFT framework that improves performance with extreme sparsity across tasks, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating parameter-scale and distribution information into fine-tuning decisions.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

*Hyeon Jeon,Kwon Ko,Soohyun Lee,Jake Hyun,Taehyun Yang,Gyehun Go,Jaemin Jo,Jinwook Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO uses a two-phase optimization of UMAP to better preserve global structure in high-dimensional data, achieving stronger global fidelity with only a modest loss in local structure, and showing improved scalability and stability over UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction often sacrifices either local neighborhoods or global relationships; this trade-off can mislead analyses of manifold structure. A method that preserves both local characteristics and global spacing is needed for reliable HD data visualization and analysis.

Method: UMATO divides UMAP optimization into two phases: (1) build a skeletal layout using representative points, establishing a global scaffold; (2) project the remaining points while preserving regional/global characteristics inferred from phase 1. This two-phase approach aims to balance local and global structure preservation and improve scalability/subsampling robustness.

Result: Quantitative experiments show UMATO outperforms widely used DR methods, including UMAP, in preserving global structure, with a slight sacrifice to local structure. It also demonstrates superior scalability and stability against initialization and subsampling. A case study and qualitative demonstrations illustrate faithful projections and enhanced reliability in visual analytics.

Conclusion: UMATO offers a robust alternative to standard DR methods by achieving better global structure preservation with an acceptable local trade-off, along with improvements in scalability and initialization/subsampling stability, making it effective for reliable HD data analysis and visualization.

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIANO redesigns PINNs into an autoregressive framework that conditions future predictions on past states, using self-supervised rollouts with physical constraints to achieve stable, accurate time-dependent PDE solving and superior weather forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs predict each point independently in time, neglecting the autoregressive nature of dynamical systems, which leads to temporal instability and accumulating errors.

Method: Propose Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) that (1) model dynamics autoregressively by conditioning predictions on past states, (2) train with self-supervised rollout of future steps, (3) enforce PDE physics constraints during rollout, and (4) provide theoretical analysis showing stability advantages over conventional PINNs.

Result: Empirical evaluation on challenging time-dependent PDEs shows state-of-the-art accuracy and stability; PIANO significantly outperforms existing PINN-based methods and shows strong performance in weather forecasting.

Conclusion: Autoregressive modeling with rollout-based training and physical constraints mitigates temporal instability in physics-informed learning, making PIANO a robust framework for time-dependent PDEs and forecasting.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

*Patricia Amado-Caballero,Luis M. San-José-Revuelta,Xinheng Wang,José Ramón Garmendia-Leiza,Carlos Alberola-López,Pablo Casaseca-de-la-Higuera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XAI-enabled CNN analyzes cough spectrograms with occlusion-based attribution, decomposing highlighted regions into five frequency subbands to extract interpretable spectral markers that differentiate COPD and chronicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable non-invasive, interpretable differentiation of COPD and other respiratory conditions through explainable spectral analysis of cough sounds, addressing the need for interpretable AI in biomedical signal diagnostics.

Method: Train a CNN on time-frequency cough representations; use occlusion maps to locate diagnostically relevant spectrogram regions; partition those regions into five frequency subbands; extract and compare spectral features across disease groups.

Result: Spectral patterns vary across subbands and disease groups; uncover complementary/ compensatory spectral trends; the approach can distinguish COPD from other conditions and chronic vs non-chronic groups using interpretable spectral markers.

Conclusion: Frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced cough analysis provides interpretable insights into cough pathophysiology and supports translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

### [116] [When Simpler Wins: Facebooks Prophet vs LSTM for Air Pollution Forecasting in Data-Constrained Northern Nigeria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16244)
*Habeeb Balogun,Yahaya Zakari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative study evaluating LSTM vs Facebook Prophet for multi-pollutant forecasting (CO, SO2, SO4) in Northern Nigeria using monthly data (2018-2023) across 19 states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data irregularities and scarcity in low-resource regions hinder accurate air pollution forecasting; assess whether advanced deep learning models outperform simpler, resource-efficient approaches under real-world constraints.

Method: Monthly observational data from 2018-2023 across 19 states were used to forecast multiple pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4). LSTM networks were compared to Facebook Prophet in terms of predictive accuracy, with analysis likely focusing on series with seasonal/long-term trends versus abrupt structural changes.

Result: Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM accuracy, especially for series dominated by seasonality and long-term trends; LSTM performs better on datasets with abrupt structural changes.

Conclusion: Deep learning is not universally superior; model choice should align with data characteristics. In resource-constrained settings, context-aware, computationally efficient methods may be preferable to complex models.

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

### [117] [FEST: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Synthetic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16254)
*Weijie Niu,Alberto Huertas Celdran,Karoline Siarsky,Burkhard Stiller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEST is an open-source framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data by jointly examining privacy (attack-based and distance-based) and utility (similarity and ML performance) metrics, validating across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified framework to comprehensively assess the privacy-utility trade-off in synthetic data generation; existing metrics are scattered and may not capture the whole picture.

Method: Proposes FEST, a Python-based library that integrates diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based) with similarity and machine learning utility metrics to evaluate synthetic tabular data; designed for systematic analysis and comparability across models.

Result: Demonstrates that FEST provides a holistic assessment of privacy-utility trade-offs and can differentiate between synthetic data generation models across datasets; validated on multiple datasets; code available on GitHub.

Conclusion: FEST fills a critical gap by providing a reproducible, comprehensive evaluation framework for synthetic data, enabling better balance between privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

### [118] [Chunked Data Shapley: A Scalable Dataset Quality Assessment for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16255)
*Andreas Loizou,Dimitrios Tsoumakos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chunked Data Shapley (C-DaSh) provides a scalable, efficient approximation for dataset quality by partitioning data into chunks and estimating their contributions, enabling fast identification of low-quality regions in large tabular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As data volumes grow, evaluating data quality with Shapley values becomes intractable for large datasets; need scalable methods to reliably identify high- vs low-quality data.

Method: Split dataset into manageable chunks. For each chunk, estimate its contribution to model performance using optimized subset selection and a single-iteration SGD, producing chunk-level Shapley estimates (C-DaSh). Use these estimates to locate high-quality data regions and flag low-quality regions, enabling downstream classification/regression tasks.

Result: C-DaSh achieves substantial speedups (80x–2300x) over existing Shapley approximations and maintains high accuracy in detecting low-quality data regions across real-world classification and regression tasks; scalable to large tabular datasets.

Conclusion: C-DaSh enables practical, scalable measurement of dataset quality for large datasets and supports both classification and regression pipelines by efficiently identifying low-quality data without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

*Tao Guo,Junxiao Wang,Fushuo Huo,Laizhong Cui,Song Guo,Jie Gui,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Taxonomy-based survey of FedLLM tuning across access and efficiency dimensions, emphasizing black-box FedLLM and inference APIs, with future directions and open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning of LLMs faces privacy, compute, and communication constraints; real-world LLMs often restrict internal access, motivating a shift to black-box and efficient tuning methods.

Method: Proposes a two-axis taxonomy: model access (white-box, gray-box, black-box) and parameter efficiency. Classifies FedLLM approaches into the three access-based categories, highlights representative methods, and reviews black-box inference API-based work; discusses directions and open challenges.

Result: Provides a synthesized landscape of FedLLM tuning, offering a taxonomy, a map of existing methods by access level and efficiency, and guidance for future research.

Conclusion: The survey establishes a structured framework for FedLLM tuning, underscores the prominence of black-box/ API-based approaches, and outlines key open challenges and advancement opportunities for privacy-preserving, efficient FedLLM development.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

### [120] [Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269)
*Yahya Badran,Christine Preisach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning model learns sparse binary auxiliary knowledge concepts (auxiliary KCs) from exercises, enabling latent concept representations that improve KT and adaptive exercise recommendation, compatible with BKT and DL KT; demonstrated gains in simulated environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-annotated KCs are incomplete and error-prone; need data-driven latent concepts that capture conceptual structure and improve student modeling and recommendations.

Method: Train a deep model to produce sparse binary vectors representing latent concepts per exercise; these auxiliary KCs augment both classic (BKT) and modern KT architectures, and improve RL-based policies and expectimax planning for recommendations.

Result: Augmenting BKT with auxiliary KCs improves predictive performance for student modeling; auxiliary KCs improve recommendation policies, yielding better student learning outcomes in simulation.

Conclusion: Auxiliary KCs capture latent conceptual structure beyond human annotations and are broadly compatible with KT models, benefiting both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation.

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

### [121] [Retrieval Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16313)
*Jongyeop Hyun,Bumsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REFINE offers a structured, retrieval-optimized feedback framework for multimodal LLMs, using three queries (Feed-Target, Feed-Check, Feed-Path) to diagnose and correct errors, yielding faster, cheaper, and more scalable multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a systematic framework to analyze and mitigate errors in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Error-driven feedback can boost reasoning, but current methods lack structured guidance, particularly for integrating visual and textual inputs in ICL settings.

Method: A teacher-student framework built around a neural error-book, REFINE employs three structured queries—Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path—to curate targeted feedback and prioritize relevant visual information, diagnose critical failure points, and propose corrective actions. It optimizes retrieval of structured feedback rather than relying on redundant retrievals, improving efficiency, token usage, and scalability.

Result: The approach reports substantial speedups and reduced computational costs, improved inference efficiency, and successful generalization across tasks, demonstrating the practical benefits of structured, retrieval-augmented feedback for multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: REFINE presents an efficient, scalable approach to error-based feedback for MLLMs, with strong potential for broader applications and future directions including automatic construction of error-books and extension to additional modalities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

*Selen Gecgel Cetin,Tolga Ovatman,Gunes Karabulut Kurt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes intent-driven threat models and a three-step cyber-physical awareness framework for space networks, combining signal feature extraction, multitask learning for reliability vs. intent, and adaptable threat assessment to improve threat detection over sequential methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to integrate reliability and security in threat assessment and to handle complex cyber-physical threats in space networks, avoiding overfitting to system-specific criteria.

Method: Three-step framework: (1) algorithm to extract characteristic properties of received signals; (2) multitask learning architecture where one task estimates reliability-related capabilities and the other infers signal intentions; (3) adaptable threat assessment aligned with varying security and reliability requirements; claims of robustness and superiority over conventional sequential methods.

Result: Claims enhanced robustness of threat detection, outperforming traditional sequential approaches, and applicability to space networks with emerging intershell links to handle complex threat scenarios.

Conclusion: A unified, adaptable framework for cyber-physical threat assessment in space networks that integrates capabilities and intents to improve robustness and address diverse security and reliability needs.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eight curated biology benchmarks (300k+ Q&As) target drug discovery challenges, and OwkinZero post-trained 8–32B open LLMs with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards. These specialist models substantially outperform larger commercial LLMs on the benchmarks, with single-task specialization generalizing to unseen tasks and multi-task training yielding broader cross-task gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with core biological reasoning required for translational and biomedical discovery. There is a need for domain-specific data and training strategies to achieve robust, generalizable biological reasoning in AI systems.

Method: Create eight comprehensive benchmark datasets (>=300k verifiable Q&A pairs) covering target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Post-train open-source LLMs using Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards to produce OwkinZero models (8–32B). Evaluate against larger commercial LLMs and analyze single-task vs multi-task generalization, including models trained on mixed datasets for broader cross-task improvements.

Result: Specialized 8–32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on the biological benchmarks. Evidence shows specialist models trained on a single task outperform base models on unseen tasks; this generalization is amplified when models are trained on a mixture of datasets, achieving broader cross-task improvements.

Conclusion: Targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated biological data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, addressing the biological reasoning blind spot and accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research,
they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for
translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

*Jin Li,Kleanthis Malialis,Stelios G. Vrachimis,Marios M. Polycarpou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised online LSTM-VAE with dual drift detection detects pipe blockages (collective anomalies) and background leakages (concept drift) in water distribution networks, enabling real-time edge-level monitoring and adaptation under non-stationary data; experiments on two realistic WDNs show superior anomaly detection and drift adaptation vs strong baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water distribution networks require reliable, real-time fault detection. Challenges include data non-stationarity and scarce labeled data, making supervised approaches impractical. The work targets two fault types: blockages as collective anomalies and background leakages as concept drift, under unsupervised online conditions.

Method: An integrated architecture combining a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism. Designed to be lightweight and memory-efficient for edge-level, real-time monitoring; capable of online adaptation to non-stationary data.

Result: Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift across two realistic WDN datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised online fault-detection framework is effective for dynamic WDN environments, offering robust, real-time detection and adaptation to non-stationary conditions and limited labeled data.

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces NIAQUE, a Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile Estimation model for probabilistic regression transfer learning. Pre-training on diverse datasets and fine-tuning on a target dataset improves task performance and competitive with strong baselines in Kaggle competitions (e.g., TabPFN, TabDPT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic regression transfer learning is underexplored; there is a need for a robust, scalable framework that leverages cross-task knowledge to enhance predictive distributions across various regression tasks.

Method: Proposes NIAQUE, a neural model designed for probabilistic regression with permutation invariance. The training paradigm includes pre-training on diverse downstream regression datasets, followed by fine-tuning on a specific target dataset to capture task-specific distributional information and enable transfer of probabilistic knowledge.

Result: Pre-training plus fine-tuning leads to improved performance on individual regression tasks. NIAQUE performs well in Kaggle competitions against strong baselines, including tree-based models and neural foundation models like TabPFN and TabDPT.

Conclusion: NIAQUE is a robust and scalable framework for probabilistic regression that harnesses transfer learning to boost predictive performance, demonstrating the value of probabilistic transfer learning across tasks.

Abstract: Transfer learning for probabilistic regression remains underexplored. This
work closes this gap by introducing NIAQUE, Neural Interpretable Any-Quantile
Estimation, a new model designed for transfer learning in probabilistic
regression through permutation invariance. We demonstrate that pre-training
NIAQUE directly on diverse downstream regression datasets and fine-tuning it on
a specific target dataset enhances performance on individual regression tasks,
showcasing the positive impact of probabilistic transfer learning. Furthermore,
we highlight the effectiveness of NIAQUE in Kaggle competitions against strong
baselines involving tree-based models and recent neural foundation models
TabPFN and TabDPT. The findings highlight NIAQUE's efficacy as a robust and
scalable framework for probabilistic regression, leveraging transfer learning
to enhance predictive performance.

### [126] [RotaTouille: Rotation Equivariant Deep Learning for Contours](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16359)
*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces RotaTouille, a framework for learning from contour data that is equivariant to both planar rotations and cyclic shifts via complex-valued circular convolution, with equivariant nonlinearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling to produce invariant representations; validated on shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contours are widespread in data and are subject to global rotations and arbitrary starting points when represented as ordered edge points. A model that respects these symmetries should perform more robustly and generalize better.

Method: Use complex-valued circular convolution to achieve simultaneous rotation and cyclic shift equivariance for contour data. Define and analyze equivariant nonlinearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling to yield invariant representations suitable for downstream tasks.

Result: Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed RotaTouille framework effectively enforces rotation and cyclic-shift equivariance and yields competitive performance on shape classification, reconstruction, and contour regression tasks.

Conclusion: RotaTouille provides a symmetry-preserving approach for learning from contour data, leveraging complex convolutions to achieve rotation and cyclic-shift equivariance and enabling robust, invariant representations for downstream applications.

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

*Ajoy Das,Gias Uddin,Shaiful Chowdhury,Mostafijur Rahman Akhond,Hadi Hemmati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A qualitative study of 204 GitHub repos using 13 open-source fairness APIs reveals two main purposes, 17 use-cases, and notable developer challenges, indicating a gap in bias detection/mitigation expertise and the need for better resources and curricula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent discriminatory AI/ML decisions in sensitive contexts by understanding how fairness APIs are used in practice and what challenges API developers face, enabling better research and education.

Method: Qualitative empirical study analyzing 204 GitHub repositories (out of 1885 candidates) that employ 13 fairness APIs, identifying usage scenarios and challenges.

Result: Identified two primary purposes (learning and solving real-world problems) and 17 use-cases; developers often lack depth in bias detection/mitigation, face troubleshooting issues, and seek opinions/resources.

Conclusion: Results can guide future bias-related SE research and inform educators to develop curricula; suggests improvements to API tooling and community resources.

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study fair cohort selection in university admissions under one-shot and sequential policies using a population model trained on prior cycles; analyzes fairness notions like meritocracy and group parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design transparent, fair admission policies when population characteristics are unknown and understand how policy updates affect fairness.

Method: Compare one-shot fixed policy vs sequential updating; train a population model on prior admission data; optimize admission policies under fairness constraints; analyze fairness properties.

Result: The abstract presents a framework and analyses; no experimental results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for fair admission policy design and a study of meritocracy and group parity under different settings; sets stage for empirical evaluation.

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

*Anahita Asadi,Leonid Popryho,Inna Partin-Vaisband*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient, topology-aware GNN with device-terminal level circuit modeling and masked autoregressive flow heads for RF circuit performance prediction across LNAs, mixers, VCOs, and PAs; achieves high accuracy with substantially fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF circuit performance is highly nonlinear and layout-sensitive, making traditional simulations expensive and ML surrogates data-hungry. There is a need for a topology-aware, data-efficient surrogate that generalizes across topologies.

Method: Model active RF circuits as graphs at the device-terminal level to preserve connectivity and symmetry, use graph neural networks with scalable message passing, and deploy masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads to model complex, multimodal performance distributions across multiple RF topologies.

Result: On multiple RF topologies, achieved symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) of 2.40% and mean relative error (MRE) of 2.91%. The approach improves MRE by 3.14x and reduces required training samples by 2.24x compared to prior work.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-aware, data-efficient GNN with MAF heads enables rapid and accurate RF circuit design automation across multiple circuit families.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

### [130] [Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420)
*Yue Pei,Hongming Zhang,Chao Gao,Martin Müller,Mengxiao Zhu,Hao Sheng,Haogang Zhu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Doctor improves target-aligned control in offline RL by adding double-checks to transformer-based RvS models, enabling reliable interpolation/extrapolation of target returns and flexible performance control; demonstrated on EpiCare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for precise control over policy performance in offline RL, not just maximizing return. Decision Transformer-based approaches struggle to align actual returns with specified target returns, especially for underrepresented or unseen targets, which limits applicability in real-world domains like healthcare.

Method: Introduce Doctor: Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. A mechanism to enforce and verify alignment between targeted returns and actual returns during training and inference, improving reliability of return-conditioned policy generation and enabling better interpolation and extrapolation.

Result: Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Demonstrated effect on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark EpiCare, where treatment policy aggressiveness can be modulated while balancing adverse event risk.

Conclusion: Doctor advances offline RL by ensuring strong target alignment for return-conditioned policies, enabling reliable and tunable policy performance. It improves upon existing RvS transformer methods and has practical implications for sensitive decision-making domains such as medicine.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

### [131] [Boardwalk: Towards a Framework for Creating Board Games with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16447)
*Álvaro Guglielmin Becker,Gabriel Bauer de Oliveira,Lana Bertoldo Rossato,Anderson Rocha Tavares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can implement digital board games from natural-language rules; an evaluation across Claude, DeepSeek, and ChatGPT on 12 games shows Claude 3.7 Sonnet as the best, with 55.6% of games error-free; results indicate viability and outline steps toward an LLM-assisted board game codegen framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Board game implementation in code is time-consuming. The study investigates whether LLMs can translate natural-language game rules into playable digital versions, aiming to enable quick, rule-compliant code generation and to compare model performance and challenges.

Method: Three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek, ChatGPT) were asked to code 12 board games (selected for variety) in free-form and within Boardwalk, a proposed General Game Playing API. Games were anonymized to avoid leveraging pre-trained knowledge. Implementations were tested for playability and rule compliance. Evaluation tracked success rate, common errors, and the influence of game popularity on performance.

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieved the best performance, with 55.6% of games produced without any errors. API compliance tended to increase error frequency, but error severity depended more on the LLM model. Overall, the approach is viable and yields actionable insights into the challenges and differences among models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-assisted pipeline for rapid board game code generation and outlines steps toward a broader framework to integrate this process, potentially democratizing and accelerating board game elaboration.

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

*Maryam Ghasemzadeh,Anton van Beek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOSTRA: a trust-region, uncertainty-aware MOBO framework for noisy, sparse data that improves Pareto frontier with limited experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOBO struggles with datasets that are sparse, scarce, and affected by experimental uncertainty, common in physical/simulation experiments, leading to inefficient resource use.

Method: NOSTRA integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty into surrogate modeling and uses trust regions to concentrate sampling on promising regions, demonstrated on two test functions with varying uncertainty.

Result: NOSTRA outperforms existing MOBO methods in noisy, sparse, and scarce data scenarios, by prioritizing samples that improve the accuracy of the Pareto frontier and enhancing data efficiency.

Conclusion: NOSTRA provides a practical, resource-efficient approach for MOBO under uncertainty, accelerating convergence to the Pareto frontier with limited experimental budgets.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

### [133] [Benchmarking the Robustness of Agentic Systems to Adversarially-Induced Harms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16481)
*Jonathan Nöther,Adish Singla,Goran Radanovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A taxonomy for harms in agentic LLM systems and BAD-ACTS benchmark; evaluates robustness to adversarial manipulation with 4 implementations and 188 harmful-action examples; compromised agent can steer others toward harmful actions; simple prompting defenses fail; message-monitoring defense improves security; open-source benchmark at github.com/JNother/BAD-ACTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand potential malicious behaviors in agentic systems and provide a robust, diverse testbed to evaluate defenses against adversarial manipulation.

Method: Develop a taxonomy of harms; construct BAD-ACTS benchmark with four agentic-system implementations across environments and a dataset of 188 harmful actions; simulate attacks where a compromised agent manipulates others to execute a target action; assess against prompting-based defenses; propose and evaluate a message-monitoring defense.

Result: Attacks show high success rates; a single adversarial agent can significantly affect system security; simple prompting defenses are insufficient; message monitoring provides a more effective defense; BAD-ACTS offers a diverse testbed for security research and is accessible at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: BAD-ACTS is a valuable resource for studying security of agentic systems, highlighting the need for robust defense strategies beyond prompting-based methods and encouraging future research with a diverse and open benchmark.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at
github.com/JNoether/BAD-ACTS

*Udvas Das,Apurv Shukla,Debabrota Basu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FraPPE provides a scalable algorithm for preference-based pure exploration in multi-objective bandits by solving the max-min lower bound efficiently (O(K L^2)) and achieving asymptotically optimal sample complexity for identifying the Pareto set under a given preference cone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently identify the Pareto-optimal arms under arbitrary preference cones in a vector-valued bandit, matching the lower bound while reducing computational burden.

Method: Three structural properties of the lower bound are derived to reduce the minimisation problem; a Frank-Wolfe optimiser accelerates the maximisation; the resulting algorithm FraPPE is reported.

Result: The max-min problem is solved in O(KL^2) time; FraPPE asymptotically attains the optimal sample complexity; numerical experiments show FraPPE requires the lowest sample complexity to identify the exact Pareto set compared with existing algorithms.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap by providing a computationally efficient PrePEx algorithm for arbitrary preference cones, with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical efficiency.

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

### [135] [Post Hoc Regression Refinement via Pairwise Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16495)
*Kevin Tirta Wijaya,Michael Sun,Minghao Guo,Hans-Peter Seidel,Wojciech Matusik,Vahid Babaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RankRefine is a model-agnostic post hoc refinement for regression that leverages pairwise rankings to improve predictions without retraining, achieving up to 10% MAE improvement in molecular property tasks using only 20 comparisons from an LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep regressors often underperform in data-scarce regimes. Incorporating expert knowledge in the form of rankings can boost accuracy without retraining, offering a practical and broadly applicable boost across domains.

Method: RankRefine blends the base regressor output with a rank-based estimate via inverse-variance weighting, using a small reference set with known properties and a set of pairwise rankings. It is a plug-and-play post hoc method requiring no model retraining and can utilize rankings from humans or general-purpose LLMs.

Result: In molecular property prediction, RankRefine yields up to a 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained via an LLM, with no fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RankRefine is practical, model-agnostic, and especially effective in low-data settings, enabling regression improvements across diverse domains simply by leveraging ranking information.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

### [136] [On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496)
*Scott Jeen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot RL in real-world settings with limited data, partial observability, and no prior data; proposes a suite of methods and empirical validation to bridge sim-to-real gaps for deployable RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL suffers from misalignment between training simulators and deployment environments, and from data scarcity and partial observability; zero-shot generalization is needed for real-world tasks.

Method: Develop a suite of zero-shot RL methods designed to operate under three constraints (data quality, observability, data availability), and conduct empirical studies to expose current failings and justify remedies.

Result: Empirical studies reveal limitations of existing zero-shot RL methods under real-world constraints and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed remedies; progress toward deployable RL is shown.

Conclusion: Overcoming sim-to-real misalignment via constraint-aware zero-shot RL methods is essential; this work advances toward practical deployment of RL in real-world domains.

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

### [137] [MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16503)
*Nadia Asif,Zhiqing Hong,Shaogang Ren,Xiaonan Zhang,Xiaojun Shang,Yukun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuST2-Learn is a multi-view spatial-temporal-type framework for predicting municipal service request times, achieving substantial MAE improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low transparency and dissatisfaction arise when residents lack reliable ETA information for non-emergency municipal service requests. Predicting service times is difficult due to dynamic spatial-temporal correlations, interactions among heterogeneous request types, and high intra-type variation.

Method: MuST2-Learn integrates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among different service request types, an intra-type variation encoder to model variation within a single type, and a spatiotemporal encoder to capture spatial-temporal correlations, jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and type dimensions.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show at least 32.5% improvement in mean absolute error over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the multi-view learning approach.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles heterogeneity and dynamic correlations in municipal service requests, enabling more accurate ETA predictions that can improve transparency and resident satisfaction.

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAMES analyzes 10 data-synthesis strategies for math reasoning and finds that increasing problem complexity and higher coverage under a fixed budget yield better improvements; introduces the FLAMES dataset and two novel strategies; fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on FLAMES achieves 81.4% on MATH, outpacing larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how different factors in the synthetic data pipeline affect math reasoning performance, addressing the lack of comparable studies due to varied setups across prior works, and to improve out-of-domain generalization and robustness.

Method: Systematic study of 10 existing data synthesis strategies plus additional factors influencing synthetic math data; experiments with a fixed data generation budget; design of two new synthesis strategies; creation of the FLAMES dataset by blending strategies; evaluation on benchmarks including OlympiadBench, CollegeMath, GSMPlus, and MATH; fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on FLAMES.

Result: Key findings: (1) data agents that increase problem complexity yield the biggest gains on math metrics; (2) with a fixed budget, broad problem coverage matters more than only retaining easily-solvable problems; (3) GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data improve competition-level benchmarks, enabling easy-to-hard generalization. The FLAMES dataset, combining novel and existing strategies, outperforms public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5), GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on FLAMES achieves 81.4% on MATH, beating larger models like Llama3-405B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Conclusion: The FLAMES framework provides practical guidance for data-synthesis design in math reasoning, highlighting the importance of problem complexity and coverage. The FLAMES dataset enables robust out-of-domain generalization and robustness, with state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks and a strong result on MATH when fine-tuned. It suggests future exploration of synthesis strategies to improve cross-domain math reasoning.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning with physics-based feedback improves diffusion-based 3D molecular generation by optimizing with force-field rewards to produce stable, physically consistent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where diffusion models with equivariant networks capture geometry but fail to ensure physically plausible equilibrium and force-field consistency; incorporate physics feedback into the generative process.

Method: Extend Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation, formulate as an MDP, fine-tune equivariant diffusion models with proximal policy optimization, and use rewards derived from force-field evaluations to guide generation toward energetically stable structures.

Result: On QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets, RLPF improves molecular stability and physical plausibility compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Physics-based feedback is valuable for generative modeling of molecules; RL with force-field rewards helps generate stable structures; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes first-order methods for escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization and introduces the Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with explicit constants, achieving convergence to an approximate second-order stationary point with provable complexity; it validates theory experimentally and provides PSD-Probe and DSG variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Saddle points impede convergence in non-convex optimization. The work provides a fully explicit, theory-grounded first-order method to escape saddles, with clear separation of descent and saddle-escape phases, dimension-aware guarantees, and practical algorithmic variants.

Method: A two-phase Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm: a descent phase using gradient-based updates, and episodic saddle-escape steps that perturb and escape negative curvature. The analysis yields explicit constants and high-probability guarantees to reach an (ε, sqrt(ρη))-approximate second-order stationary point. Additional contributions include a finite-difference variant PSD-Probe and a stochastic extension PSGD with robust mini-batch sizing.

Result: Proves PSD reaches an (ε, sqrt(ρη))-approximate second-order stationary point with high probability. Gradient evaluations: O(ℓ Δ_f / ε^2) for the descent phase, plus O((ℓ / sqrt(ρ ε)) log(d/δ)) per escape episode, with at most O(ℓ Δ_f / ε^2) episodes. Experimental validation on synthetic and ML tasks confirms the predicted dimension dependence and per-episode decrease. Provides complete algorithmic specifications including PSD-Probe and PSGD.

Conclusion: PSD offers an explicit, well-separated descent/escape framework for escaping strict saddles with provable guarantees and practical variants. The results bridge theory and empirical performance, delivering both rigorous bounds and implementable algorithms for non-convex optimization.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

*Adam O. Rawashdeh,Jason T. L. Wang,Katherine G. Herbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an interpretable LSTM-based model with attention for predicting if a solar active region that flares within 24h will also emit a CME, using post hoc model-agnostic interpretability to explain predictions across AR time-series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solar storm prediction is clinically and technologically important, but deep learning models are often black boxes. Adding interpretability to an LSTM-based solar storm predictor can increase trust, accountability, and understanding of the decision factors influencing CME associations.

Method: An LSTM network with an attention mechanism is trained on time-series data from solar active regions to predict CME occurrence following a flare within 24 hours. Post hoc, model-agnostic interpretability techniques are applied to reveal factors contributing to predictions across multiple sequences within an active region.

Result: The study demonstrates interpretability for an LSTM-based solar storm prediction model, marking the first integration of interpretability into such a model.

Conclusion: Incorporating interpretability helps make the model’s predictions accountable and reliable, providing insights into model behavior across AR sequences and potentially increasing trust in solar storm forecasts.

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

### [142] [RL Is Neither a Panacea Nor a Mirage: Understanding Supervised vs. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16546)
*Hangzhan Jin,Sicheng Lv,Sifan Wu,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-FT largely recovers SFT-induced OOD performance losses but cannot fully restore when SFT overfits strongly; spectral analysis shows direction shifts in the top and bottom singular-vector directions drive most change, while the bulk spectrum remains intact; low-rank and shallow-layer interventions can recover ~70-80% of OOD performance before RL; stronger SFT checkpoints aid RL recovery, while overfitted models resist restoration. RL mainly counters directional drift, not discovering new solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how post-training stages (SFT vs RL-FT) reshape model representations and OOD performance, reconcile reports of RL's superior OOD robustness, and identify inexpensive spectrum-aware interventions that can improve OOD performance before costly RL fine-tuning, using an OOD variant of a 24-point card game and spectrum-based diagnostics.

Method: Empirical study on an out-of-distribution variant of a 24-point card game with spectrum-based diagnostics. Analyze singular-vector directions and magnitudes of model representations across layers under SFT and RL-FT, quantify direction shifts in the top/bottom spectrum, examine the impact of restoring the top 20% directions or the first 25% of layers, compare models (e.g., Llama-11B, Qwen-7B), and assess how SFT checkpoint strength affects RL recoverability.

Result: (1) RL-FT can recover much of the OOD performance loss caused by SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%), but cannot fully recover when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than changes in singular value magnitudes, concentrating on directions tied to the largest and smallest singular values while the bulk spectrum remains largely intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery work well: restoring directions for the top 20% of singular values or the first 25% of layers recovers 70–80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints improve subsequent RL recovery; overfitted SFT tapes resist restoration. These findings reconcile prior reports by showing RL primarily mitigates SFT-induced directional drift rather than discovering new solutions, and suggest inexpensive knobs like low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets before RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: A spectrum-aware view explains why RL-FT helps but cannot fully compensate for SFT-induced shifts under strong overfitting. By targeting directional drift in the singular-vector space, practitioners can apply cheap recovery steps—low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets—before RL, potentially achieving most of the OOD performance gains without expensive RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart
factory. One possible approach is the deployment of wireless monitoring
systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work

structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at
15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex

### [144] [Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16560)
*David Chanin,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Setting L0 sparsity in Sparse Autoencoders is crucial; mis-setting L0 leads to feature mixing and poor learning; a method to identify the true L0 aligns with peak sparse probing in LLMs; many SAEs use too-low L0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAEs aim to map LLM internal activations to interpretable single-concept features, but the critical hyperparameter L0 has been treated as free. Determining the correct L0 is essential for recovering true features and reliable probing.

Method: Analyze BatchTopK SAEs to study the impact of L0; identify failure modes when L0 is too low or too high; develop a procedure to determine the correct L0 for a given training distribution; validate on toy models and LLMs; show that the L0 maximizing sparse probing coincides with the true L0.

Result: Mis-setting L0 causes features to mix and can lead to degenerate solutions; the proposed method recovers the true L0 in toy models; in LLMs, the L0 yielding peak sparse probing performance matches the true L0; most commonly used SAEs employ an L0 that is too low.

Conclusion: For SAEs to learn meaningful, separable features, L0 must be chosen accurately. The work provides a practical method to select L0 and highlights a common pitfall in existing SAEs.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

### [145] [Closer to Reality: Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16568)
*Guangyu Sun,Jingtao Li,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving semi-supervised federated learning framework for foundation models, FedMox, using a sparse mixture-of-experts with a spatial router and Soft-Mixture to adapt models under PSSFL constraints on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models generalize well but require adaptation to downstream tasks while respecting privacy. In PSSFL, edge devices hold unlabeled, low-resolution data and the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data; existing FL methods fail to cope with resource limits and resolution gaps.

Method: Introduce FedMox, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture. A spatial router aligns features across resolutions; a Soft-Mixture strategy stabilizes semi-supervised learning. The setting assumes edge devices with unlabeled, low-res data and a server with labeled, high-res data. Object detection is used as a case study, with real-world autonomous driving datasets to validate performance and memory efficiency.

Result: FedMox significantly improves adaptation performance under PSSFL while keeping edge memory usage low. It addresses computational and resolution mismatch, yielding strong gains on object detection tasks in autonomous driving datasets compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedMox enables scalable, privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios by handling resource and resolution constraints, offering a practical path toward deploying foundation models on edge devices for privacy-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

*Anyu Ying,Natarajan Balaji Shankar,Chyi-Jiunn Lin,Mohan Shi,Pu Wang,Hye-jin Shim,Siddhant Arora,Hugo Van hamme,Abeer Alwan,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flat-start training on child speech with SSL features reduces adult-speech bias and improves robustness, scales up to 1B parameters with gains, then saturates; open-data models are needed for reliable child ASR; ESPnet benchmark supports robust child speech training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Child speech recognition is challenging due to high acoustic variability and limited annotated data. SSL models often bias toward adult speech, and the utility of flat-start training versus fine-tuning remains underexplored. The study aims to benchmark training strategies and provide an open dataset/benchmark.

Method: Systematic comparison of flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Analysis of model scaling up to 1B parameters. Age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis. All experiments conducted with ESPnet using a public benchmark.

Result: SSL representations show bias toward adult speech. Flat-start training on child speech mitigates this bias. Model-scale benefits persist up to ~1B parameters, with diminishing returns beyond. Proprietary models like Whisper have limitations for child speech tasks, underscoring the need for open-data models. An open ESPnet-based benchmark is provided for robust child speech research.

Conclusion: Flat-start training with child speech and SSL features offers more robust child ASR by mitigating adult-bias and leveraging scaling up to 1B parameters. Benefits saturate beyond that, and open-data models/benchmarks are essential for reliable child speech research.

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

*Badhan Mazumder,Aline Kotoski,Vince D. Calhoun,Dong Hye Ye*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: NeuroKoop: a neural Koopman operator-based GNN that fuses SBM and FNC brain graphs for predicting prenatal drug exposure in adolescents, outperforming baselines and highlighting key structural-functional connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding prenatal psychoactive exposure effects is hampered by multimodal neuroimaging complexity; standard methods fail to leverage complementary information from structural and functional networks.

Method: Introduce NeuroKoop, a GNN framework that uses neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion to combine node embeddings from SBM and FNC graphs, learning a unified representation for PDE status; applied to ABCD adolescent cohort.

Result: Outperforms relevant baselines; more robust PDE classification; identifies salient brain connections bridging structure and function.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective multimodal integration via Koopman-based fusion, advancing understanding of PDE's neurodevelopmental impact and offering a generalizable approach for multimodal neuroimaging analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.
