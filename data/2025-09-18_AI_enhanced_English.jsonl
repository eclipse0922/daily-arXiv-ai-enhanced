Most existing image annotation software\nrequires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for\non-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This\nconstraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where\nreal-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly\ncommon. In this work, we introduce \\texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical\nuser interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,\nmicroscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is\ndesigned to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to\nprecisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial\ngraphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of\nB\\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with\nnon-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also\nintegrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for\nobject detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with\nhigh-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra\noperations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data\ncollection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in\nexperimental workflows.
