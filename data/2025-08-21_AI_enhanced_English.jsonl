Efficient target tracking in\ndynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and\npollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets\nthat drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is\na challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal\nvariations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative\npath planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with\ninitially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our\napproach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position\ndistributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target\ntracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our\nproposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to\nexisting methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning\nobjective.

In this\npaper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,\nwhich modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained\nvector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined\nproblem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that\nSGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide\nbounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an\napproximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.\nThe key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose\nthe sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we\nsystematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for\nasymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with\noptimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the\nvector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,\nimage datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGFM shifts guidance from modifying the vector field to sampling from a modified source distribution, enabling exact target distribution with exact sampling and providing Wasserstein-error bounds under approximations; validated on synthetic and real tasks.", "motivation": "To simplify and strengthen guidance for generative models by keeping the pre-trained vector field fixed and controlling the source distribution, enabling theoretical guarantees, flexible sampling, and compatibility with existing flow-matching methods.", "method": "Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) modifies the source distribution directly while preserving the pre-trained vector field.
