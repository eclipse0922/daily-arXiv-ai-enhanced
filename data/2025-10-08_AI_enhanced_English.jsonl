However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\\% on\nHigh Quality data and +10.5\\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.\nOur results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to\npreference alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "MADPO introduces instance-level margin-based reweighting for Direct Preference Optimization by first training a reward model to estimate preference margins, then adapting the DPO loss per sample with continuous weights that amplify hard pairs and dampen easy ones.", "motivation": "DPO's fixed temperature leads to suboptimal learning across diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies.
