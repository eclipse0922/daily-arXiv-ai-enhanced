### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF replaces a trained reward model with a general Oracle ranker and introduces GRPO_rank to optimize rank-based feedback, yielding stronger, more data-efficient fine-tuning for video-language models than traditional score-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs scale, collecting human preference data becomes costly. Current RLAIF relies on expensive reward models trained on video narratives; a general ranker and rank-based optimization can cut costs while maintaining or improving alignment with human preferences.

Method: Propose Oracle-RLAIF: use an Oracle ranker to rank candidate responses instead of scoring; develop GRPO_rank loss based on Group Relative Policy Optimization to optimize ordinal, rank-based feedback.

Result: Empirical results show Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs fine-tuned with existing methods across multiple video comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF enables flexible, data-efficient alignment of large multimodal video models using RL from rank rather than score, mitigating reliance on specialized reward models and advancing efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR presents a unified vision-to-action framework that reconstructs physically plausible, visually faithful human motion from monocular videos by integrating 3D grounding (pixel-as-ray), distillation from mocap experts, and reinforcement learning in a physics-based simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing kinematics-based, two-stage motion estimation methods often produce unrealistic artifacts due to lack of physics constraints and error accumulation; there is a need for a single framework that enforces physical plausibility while remaining visually aligned with input videos.

Method: Lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays via a pixel-as-ray strategy to provide global pose guidance; feed these rays along with local visual features from a pretrained encoder into a vision-conditioned control policy in a physics-based humanoid simulator; employ a distillation scheme from a mocap-trained expert to improve sample efficiency, followed by reinforcement learning with physics-based rewards to refine motion.

Result: PhysHMR achieves high-fidelity, physically plausible motions across diverse scenarios and outperforms prior methods in both visual accuracy and physical realism as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: A unified framework that combines soft global grounding, mocap-informed policy distillation, and physics-based RL can produce motion reconstructions that are both visually faithful and physically plausible, mitigating error accumulation from two-stage pipelines.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)
*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Intelligent fusion of human and machine judgments in face recognition can improve accuracy, with a large fusion zone where collaboration helps even when humans are less accurate than the machine; selection strategies yield better performance than using machines alone or all judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when human-human and human-machine collaboration improves face-recognition accuracy and to develop a practical framework (rules like PAR) for deploying intelligent fusion.

Method: Analyzed data from expert and non-expert face identifiers; examined both human-human and human-machine collaborations; quantified how baseline accuracy differences affect fusion benefits; derived the Proximal Accuracy Rule; identified a fusion zone; implemented intelligent fusion by selecting humans likely to improve a high-performing machine; compared performance to machine-alone and to all judgments; also explored a fully human system via graph theory.

Result: Fusion benefits increase as baseline accuracy difference decreases; PAR predicts fusion benefit across broad ability ranges; a large fusion zone exists where fusing improves accuracy even though the human trails the machine; intelligent fusion surpasses machine-alone and all judgments; a fully human system approximates average intelligent H-M performance, but intelligent H-M better mitigates impact of low-performing humans.

Conclusion: The study provides an evidence-based framework for integrating human judgment with AI in face identification, highlighting when and how to invoke human input to maximize accuracy and safety in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First work to quantify uncertainty in generative video models; introduces S-QUBED (a black-box UQ method with latent-space decomposition into aleatoric and epistemic), a calibration metric, and a UQ dataset; experiments show calibrated total uncertainty correlates with accuracy and can separate uncertainty components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models can hallucinate and lack uncertainty quantification, raising safety concerns. Unlike LLMs, there is no established UQ method for video models. This work aims to enable reliable uncertainty estimates and principled decomposition of uncertainty.

Method: Propose a robust correlation-based calibration metric with no stringent modeling assumptions. Introduce S-QUBED, a black-box UQ framework that leverages latent modeling to decompose predictive uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components. Use latent-space conditioning to separate uncertainty due to vague task specifications from model knowledge gaps. Provide a UQ dataset for benchmarking calibration in video models.

Result: S-QUBED yields calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with task accuracy and can effectively separate into aleatoric and epistemic components. Demonstrated on benchmark video datasets.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first uncertainty quantification framework for video models, including a calibration metric, a practical latent-space UQ method, and a benchmarking dataset, enabling safer deployment and future improvements in video generation under uncertainty.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEO is a training-free, backbone-independent method that optimizes the text embedding of a simple prompt in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to improve aesthetic quality, guided by a tripartite objective: aesthetic fidelity, embedding adherence, and prompt preservation, achieving state-of-the-art-like performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem: simple/un-curated prompts often yield suboptimal aesthetics in diffusion-generated images. Goal: enhance visual quality without retraining the model or changing its weights, maintaining a stable and efficient workflow.

Method: At inference time, treat the prompt embedding as optimizeable parameters. Use a tripartite objective: (1) aesthetic fidelity loss to improve image quality, (2) embedding adherence loss to ensure the optimization remains aligned with the optimized embedding, and (3) a prompt preservation term to limit divergence from the original prompt. The method is training-free and backbone-independent, i.e., it does not modify model weights and applies across different diffusion backbones.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show improved aesthetic quality, either surpassing or matching state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods.

Conclusion: PEO provides a simple, training-free, backbone-agnostic approach to boost aesthetics for simple prompts by optimizing their embeddings, with demonstrated competitive performance and broad applicability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Marker-less multi-camera ego-exo tracking system for accurate 3D hand pose capture in unconstrained environments and a synchronized multi-view dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets are largely captured in controlled lab settings, limiting environmental diversity and 3D annotation accuracy for hands in the wild; there is a need for robust 3D hand tracking in unconstrained environments.

Method: A lightweight back-mounted capture rig plus eight exocentric cameras and a user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset (providing two egocentric views) are used to build an ego-exo tracking pipeline that yields accurate 3D hand pose ground truth. The system collects synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand poses to create an annotated dataset.

Result: Rigorous evaluation confirms the quality of the 3D hand pose ground truth; the collected dataset demonstrates a significant reduction in the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The marker-less ego-exo system enables accurate 3D hand tracking in-the-wild and provides a valuable dataset to improve generalization in 3D hand pose estimation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time co-speech video synthesis by distilling a diffusion model into a few-step student model using input pose-conditioned sparse attention and an input-aware distillation loss, yielding faster inference and improved lip-sync and motion realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based co-speech video generation is accurate but slow due to long denoising chains and costly attention; real-time deployment requires faster, more sample-efficient models without sacrificing quality.

Method: Distill a multi-step diffusion video model into a lightweight student; apply input human pose conditioning to guide attention to relevant regions; use input-aware sparse attention aligned with pose keypoints to reduce computations and improve temporal coherence; introduce input-aware distillation loss to enhance lip synchronization and hand motion realism; integrate both to achieve real-time speed with improved visual quality.

Result: Real-time performance achieved with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods; extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed attention and distillation design.

Conclusion: Input-aware pose-conditioned diffusion distillation is effective for fast, high-quality co-speech video synthesis and supports practical deployment in video creation and virtual agents.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces FunLoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using functional, rank-1 LoRA for continual adaptation of deep generative models that avoids catastrophic forgetting and reduces training time and memory, outperforming diffusion-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual adaptation of deep generative models suffers from catastrophic forgetting and expensive retraining on synthetic data, which degrades long-term performance and is computationally costly.

Method: Proposes functional LoRA (FunLoRA): a conditioning mechanism using exclusively rank-1 matrices whose effective rank is incrementally increased via functions, enabling dynamic, task-specific conditioning. Applied as a PEFT method to flow-matching based models trained from scratch.

Result: Experiments show FunLoRA surpasses prior diffusion-based SOTA, achieving higher classification accuracy with lower memory footprint and faster sampling times.

Conclusion: FunLoRA provides a memory- and time-efficient solution to continual adaptation by avoiding forgetting while updating only on current-task data, offering a strong PEFT approach for generative models.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-field-of-view, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic light/sign recognition in the US using multi-source data and a three-layer defense stack with temporal voting; achieves state-of-the-art mAP and reduced ASR against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perception errors from digital and natural perturbations threaten AV safety; current models lack temporal continuity, multistatic sensing, and robustness to degradation.

Method: Assemble a multi-source dataset (aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, Texas videos); define four ODDs (highway, night, rainy, urban); align mid/long-term sequences; implement a unified three-layer defense: feature squeezing, defensive distillation, entropy-based anomaly detection, plus sequence-wise temporal voting; evaluate on anomaly detection task; test physical transferability via recapture probes.

Result: Unified Defense Stack achieves 79.8 mAP and 18.2% ASR; reduces high-risk misclassification to 32%; outperforms YOLOv8/9 and BEVFormer; demonstrates transferability.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness to both digital and natural degradations in traffic sign/light recognition, with strong performance across diverse conditions and potential for real-world deployment; further work could explore broader generalization and scalability.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

### [11] [Smart-GRPO: Smartly Sampling Noise for Efficient RL of Flow-Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02654)
*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO introduces an iterative, reward-guided approach to optimize noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching text-to-image models, yielding better rewards and higher image quality than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are deterministic and ill-suited for RL. Previous perturbations with random noise are inefficient and unstable, limiting RL-based improvements and human alignment.

Method: An iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions, enabling efficient RL in flow-matching frameworks.

Result: Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline perturbation methods across experiments.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, balancing efficient training with human-aligned, high-quality generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

### [12] [FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02691)
*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter is a fast, robust surface reconstruction method from free sparse images using end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, differentiable camera parameter estimation, and geometry-aware optimization; it uses a Transformer encoder and a self-splitting Gaussian head to initialize a dense scene and prunes floaters; achieves state-of-the-art results on DTU and Replica.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D geometry from sparse, uncalibrated views is challenging. Existing Gaussian splatting methods perform well with dense, calibrated views but degrade with sparse data due to limited overlap and overfitting. There is a need for a fast, robust pipeline that can reconstruct accurate surfaces from free sparse images.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline that uses a large Transformer to encode multi-view images, a self-splitting Gaussian head to generate a dense, geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization, contribution-based pruning to remove local floaters, and differentiable camera parameter optimization with depth and multi-view feature supervision during rapid optimization.

Result: FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter delivers fast, robust surface reconstruction from free sparse images by combining dense Gaussian initialization, learnable camera parameter estimation, and geometry-aware optimization to handle sparse-view challenges.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [13] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC introduces a multimodal motion synthesis framework that jointly models intention and visual priors, featuring a mixture-of-attention mechanism, evaluated on the Mo440H benchmark; it achieves substantial FID improvements and enables intention and vision-conditioned generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven motion synthesis currently lacks causal action semantics and visual grounding, limiting precision and personalization. Integrating intention modeling and visual priors can improve controllability and realism.

Method: Joint optimization of multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, plus a novel mixture-of-attention with adaptive scope to align conditional tokens with motion subsequences. A new Mo440H benchmark (440 hours across 21 datasets) supports training and evaluation. Finetuning with a lightweight text head enables efficient captioning and enables vision-conditioned generation; code is released.

Result: Finetuning reduces FID by 38.6% on HumanML3D and 34.6% on Mo440H; surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head; enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: MoGIC advances controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding by fusing intention modeling with visual priors and proposing a versatile mixture-of-attention mechanism, supported by the Mo440H dataset and released code for broader research and applications.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-adaptive control-point framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular video, using semantic/motion priors and spline trajectories to adapt density to motion complexity, improving quality and efficiency over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse control approaches reduce computation but allocate control points purely by geometry, causing static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. There is a need to align control density with motion complexity and leverage semantic/motion priors to guide allocation in dynamic regions of monocular scenes.

Method: Use patch-token-node correspondences derived from vision foundation models. Apply motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions and suppress redundancy in static backgrounds. Implement iterative voxelization and motion tendency scoring to enable flexible density adaptation. Replace MLP-based deformation fields with spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized from 2D tracklets for smoother, more stable motion representation and optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the fundamental mismatch between control-point allocation and motion complexity, enabling dynamic-density adaptation guided by semantic/motion priors and smoother spline-based temporal representations, thereby enhancing monocular dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

### [15] [Net2Net: When Un-trained Meets Pre-trained Networks for Robust Real-World Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02733)
*Weimin Yuan,Cai Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Net2Net fuses an untrained deep image prior with a supervised pre-trained denoiser (DRUNet) via regularization by denoising (RED) to adapt to real-world noise on a per-image basis, improving generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world noise is highly varied and difficult for handcrafted priors. Supervised DL methods require large labeled datasets and may not generalize across noise types or imaging conditions. An effective approach should adapt to each image while leveraging learned representations.

Method: A hybrid framework where an untrained network (DIP-based) adapts to the noise characteristics of each input image without labels, and a pre-trained network (DRUNet) provides robust denoising. Regularization by denoising (RED) links the two networks during optimization to regularize the output towards a denoised result.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that Net2Net achieves superior real-world noise removal, with improved generalization and robustness, especially when training data is limited.

Conclusion: Combining untrained and pre-trained models via RED yields a versatile denoising method that adapts to per-image noise while leveraging learned representations, enhancing performance across diverse noise patterns.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

### [16] [Retrv-R1: A Reasoning-Driven MLLM Framework for Universal and Efficient Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02745)
*Lanyun Zhu,Deyi Ji,Tianrun Chen,Haiyang Wu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1 presents an RL-enhanced multimodal LLM for universal retrieval, featuring an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, and a two-stage training paradigm (activation with a synthetic CoT dataset and RL with a curriculum reward) to achieve state-of-the-art performance, efficiency, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is strong interest in using RL to boost LLM reasoning, but applying methods like DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval is hindered by high token costs and instability; a specialized design is needed to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Introduce an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism to reduce token usage while preserving critical information; employ a retrieval-tailored synthetic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) dataset for an activation stage, followed by reinforcement learning using a curriculum reward to stabilize and improve optimization for retrieval tasks.

Result: Retrv-R1 attains state-of-the-art performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and training design—compression with inspection, synthetic-CoT activation, and curriculum-guided RL—enables RL-based LLMs to excel at multimodal universal retrieval with improved efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

### [17] [Bayesian Test-time Adaptation for Object Recognition and Detection with Vision-language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02750)
*Lihua Zhou,Mao Ye,Shuaifeng Li,Nianxin Li,Jinlin Wu,Xiatian Zhu,Lei Deng,Hongbin Liu,Jiebo Luo,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCA+ is a training-free Bayesian test-time adaptation method for vision-language models that uses a dynamic cache of class embeddings, scales, and priors to fuse the original predictions with cache-informed predictions, achieving state-of-the-art results on recognition and detection under distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time distribution shifts degrade vision-language models. Existing TTA methods are either computationally heavy due to backpropagation or only adapt likelihood while ignoring priors. A training-free approach that jointly adapts semantics and context via priors and uncertainty is needed.

Method: Introduce a dynamic cache that stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and adaptive priors derived from historical predictions. Treat adaptation as Bayesian inference by fusing the base VLM output with a cache-based prediction. The cache-based prediction combines a likelihood term (feature and scale similarity) and a prior term (evolving class distribution). Use uncertainty-guided fusion. The method is training-free (no backpropagation).

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks under distribution shifts, with efficient, real-time-capable operation.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides a unified, training-free TTA framework for both recognition and detection in vision-language models, improving semantic understanding and contextual confidence through dual adaptation and uncertainty-aware fusion.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

### [18] [Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760)
*Matthias Perkonigg,Patrick Rockenschaub,Georg Göbel,Adelheid Wöhrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HGCD-BT, a hierarchical generalized category discovery method that combines hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning to discover known and unknown brain tumor classes in histology images; achieves 28% accuracy gain on patch-level OpenSRH data and generalizes to slide-level WSI across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-class classifiers cannot capture unseen tumor types; unsupervised methods lack use of labelled data, while semi-supervised methods often assume all potential classes are represented. A hierarchical, semi-supervised approach is needed to reflect brain tumor taxonomy and enable discovery of unknown classes.

Method: Introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT) by integrating hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning and a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss, extending contrastive learning-based GCD.

Result: Significant improvement: +28% accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification on OpenSRH, especially for unseen tumor categories; shows generalizability to slide-level classification of H&E WSIs from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas across imaging modalities.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT demonstrates effective integration of hierarchical taxonomy with generalized category discovery, enabling discovery of unknown tumor types and generalization across imaging modalities, with potential to support intra-operative decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

*Xian Zhang,Zexi Wu,Zinuo Li,Hongming Xu,Luqi Gong,Farid Boussaid,Naoufel Werghi,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key is a training-free keyframe sampler for long-form videos that optimizes a unified Relevance–Diversity Max-Volume objective with a gating mechanism, enabling real-time, plug-and-play compatibility with VLMs and improved query-driven understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos pose challenges for vision–language models due to length and information density. Uniform sampling and rigid exclusion windows miss critical moments or short cues. There is a need for a method that balances query relevance and frame diversity in a training-free, efficient way that can adapt to weakly aligned queries.

Method: AdaRD-Key combines a query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity term to select informative, non-redundant frames. A lightweight relevance-aware gate switches to diversity-only mode when relevance is weak, ensuring broad coverage. The pipeline is training-free, real-time on a single GPU, and plug-and-play with existing VLMs.

Result: Experiments on LongVideoBench and Video-MME show state-of-the-art performance for long-form videos. The method is training-free, efficient, and compatible with existing VLMs, with code available publicly.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key provides an efficient, robust, training-free solution for query-driven long-form video understanding by jointly optimizing relevance and diversity, with a gating mechanism to handle weakly aligned queries and real-time inference on a single GPU.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

### [20] [Reasoning Riddles: How Explainability Reveals Cognitive Limits in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02780)
*Prahitha Movva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides an explainability-focused analysis of Vision-Language Models on rebus puzzles, introducing a 221-item annotated dataset and an evaluation framework to separate reasoning quality from answer accuracy, and shows prompting shapes cognitive strategies and performance, with strengths in visual composition but limits in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear cognitive processes in VLMs on lateral-thinking tasks; there is a need to move beyond accuracy metrics to understand reasoning patterns, biases, and failure modes, especially for complex puzzles like rebuses.

Method: Create a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories; develop an evaluation framework that separates reasoning quality from answer correctness; investigate three prompting strategies designed to elicit different explanatory processes and analyze their effects on cognitive approach and problem solving.

Result: Reasoning quality varies across puzzle categories; models show systematic strengths in visual composition while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism; prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explainability should be treated as an integral component of model performance, not merely a post-hoc addition; prompting can steer reasoning and reveal cognitive biases, underscoring the need for evaluation that accounts for explainability across diverse cognitive tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

TL;DR: A synthetic, cross-domain text-removal benchmark using complex backgrounds, object-aware placement, and vision-language model content to provide clean ground truth; addresses artifacts in SCUT-EnsText and enables robust evaluation; available on HuggingFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCUT-EnsText and similar datasets suffer from ground-truth artifacts, simplistic text backgrounds, and evaluation metrics that fail to capture removal quality; a versatile benchmark with clean ground truth is needed for out-of-domain generalization.

Method: Synthesize text on diverse, complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and VLM-generated content; produce paired images with and without text to create clean ground truth; ensure challenging removal scenarios; dataset hosted at HuggingFace.

Result: Introduction of a synthetic text removal benchmark applicable to non-scene-text domains; clean ground truth; publicly available dataset at the specified URL.

Conclusion: This benchmark mitigates limitations of existing datasets, enabling robust evaluation and cross-domain generalization for text removal methods.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

### [22] [Align Your Query: Representation Alignment for Multimodality Medical Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02789)
*Ara Seo,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Hyungjin Chung,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DETR-style detector improves multimodal medical object detection by aligning object-query representations with modality tokens through Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) and a short pretraining (QueryREPA), achieving modality-aware, class-faithful queries with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical object detection performance deteriorates when training with mixed modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces; there is a need for simple, detector-agnostic alignment methods to unify representations.

Method: Define modality tokens as compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality. Integrate these via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), which mixes object-query representations through self-attention to propagate modality context within the DETR-like query set; introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to modality tokens using a modality-balanced contrastive objective. The approach preserves DETR architectures with negligible latency and no architectural changes.

Result: Across diverse modalities trained together, the method consistently improves average precision (AP) with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, enabling more robust multimodality medical object detection.

Conclusion: Modality-aware, class-faithful object queries transfer effectively to downstream training, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality detection without changing DETR architectures.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

*Jingyuan Deng,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskCD masks the LVLM's image heads to create contrastive samples for decoding, reducing hallucinations while preserving general capabilities, demonstrated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b across several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) cause outputs that contradict input visuals/text. Existing strategies like contrastive decoding and attention manipulation have limitations: constructing good negative samples is hard and attention-based edits can be unstable or overly sensitive. A stable, architecture-aligned method is needed to curb hallucinations without sacrificing capabilities.

Method: Identify and mask the image heads within LVLMs to generate contrastive samples used during decoding (contrastive decoding). This masking creates targeted negative samples from the image-facing components, guiding the model away from hallucinations while preserving general multimodal capabilities.

Result: Empirical evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b across benchmarks CHAIR, POPE, AMBER, and MME show MaskCD effectively alleviates hallucinations and maintains broad capabilities of LVLMs.

Conclusion: MaskCD provides a stable, architecture-aligned approach to mitigating LVLM hallucinations, with promising results and publicly available resources (GitHub).

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

*Bing Li,Jiaxin Chen,Dongming Zhang,Xiuguo Bao,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream compressed video action recognition framework (MEACI-Net) that enhances motion representations and cross-modal fusion via Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA), achieving improved accuracy and efficiency on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the coarse and noisy dynamics inherent in compressed videos and the insufficient fusion of heterogeneous RGB and motion modalities, by leveraging motion cues (motion vectors/residuals) and targeted cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion Enhancement (MEACI-Net), consisting of: (1) a motion stream with a multi-scale block plus a denoising module to improve representation learning; (2) Selective Motion Complement (SMC) module to provide spatio-temporally attentive local motion features for RGB; (3) Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) module to selectively augment features from both modalities to enhance fusion. Two-stream architecture (RGB and motion) with compressed video inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 show that MEACI-Net effectively improves recognition performance and achieves better efficiency compared to baselines, demonstrating strong cross-modal interaction under compressed-video settings.

Conclusion: MEACI-Net offers a robust solution for compressed video action recognition by addressing coarse dynamics and modality fusion challenges through motion enhancement and attentive cross-modal interactions, with demonstrated gains on standard benchmarks and potential applicability to resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

*Patrick Sandoz,Antoine N. André,Guillaume J. Laurent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VERNIER is an open-source phase processing tool that enables fast, robust 6-DOF pose estimation from pseudo-periodic patterns, achieving nanometer/nanoradian resolution with appropriate magnification by using a phase-based local thresholding algorithm that is robust to noise, defocus, and occlusion; it provides pattern design guidance and demonstrates results on synthetic and experimental images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation at small scales requires reliable 6-DOF measurement with nanometer and microradian resolutions over large ranges. Existing fiducial markers are limited, so the authors develop open-source phase-processing-based methods (VERNIER) to improve robustness and accuracy across microscopy applications.

Method: VERNIER uses phase processing of pseudo-periodic patterns. It includes a phase-based local thresholding algorithm for robustness to noise, defocus, and occlusion. The workflow covers multiple pattern types to suit different needs, and the implementation is demonstrated on synthetic and experimental images. The paper also provides guidelines for selecting pattern designs and microscope magnifications relative to desired performance.

Result: The approach is reported to be robust to noise, defocus, and occlusion. Pattern-encoding enables centimeter-range measurements, while phase processing enables nanometer-scale resolution. The paper presents synthetic and experimental validations and an open-source implementation.

Conclusion: VERNIER offers a fast, reliable pose measurement solution for nanoscale microscopy based on phase processing of pseudo-periodic patterns. It includes practical guidelines for pattern design and magnification choices and is available as open-source software, suitable for various microscopy applications.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

TL;DR: Proposes Med-K2N, a K-to-N cross-modal medical image generation framework that adaptively fuses multi-modal inputs and preserves modality identity, using three modules (PreWeightNet, ThresholdNet, EffiWeightNet) and a CMIM constraint, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical demand for flexible, robust reconstruction of missing imaging modalities across diverse tasks. Key challenges include modeling heterogeneous modality contributions, filtering noisy information to maintain fusion quality, and preserving modality identity across multiple outputs. The authors also draw inspiration from sequential frame paradigms and clinicians’ progressive workflows to treat multi-modal data as progressively integrated frames.

Method: Introduce Med-K2N with three collaborative modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for adaptive filtering of modalities, and EffiWeightNet for computing effective modality-task weights. Implement a Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) to enforce causal constraints between generated images and target modality descriptions via vision-language modeling. Treat multi-modal data as sequential frames and apply quality-driven selection for progressive fusion, learning weights for modality-task pairs, and memorizing beneficial fusion patterns.

Result: Experimental results show that Med-K2N outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins across multiple benchmarks. The authors provide source code for replication.

Conclusion: The framework offers adaptive, progressive fusion of multi-modal medical data with identity-consistent outputs, addressing heterogeneity, noisy fusion, and multi-output consistency. It holds promise for flexible clinical modality reconstruction and can be extended with more modalities or tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

### [27] [ELMF4EggQ: Ensemble Learning with Multimodal Feature Fusion for Non-Destructive Egg Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02876)
*Md Zahim Hassan,Md. Osama,Muhammad Ashad Kabir,Md. Saiful Islam,Zannatul Naim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal ensemble framework ELMF4EggQ uses external features (image, shape, weight) to classify egg grade and freshness, achieving 86.57% and 70.83% accuracy respectively on a 186-sample brown egg dataset; claims first non-invasive ML assessment of internal quality and releases a labeled dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive, rapid, and accurate assessment of egg quality is essential for safety, standards, and efficiency in poultry production. Existing internal quality measurements are destructive; leveraging external attributes via ML can infer internal quality.

Method: Construct a publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs with external features (image, shape, weight) and internal-labeled quality (via yolk index and Haugh unit). Extract deep features from external images using pretrained CNNs (ResNet152, DenseNet169, ResNet152V2), apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, use SMOTE for augmentation, and train multiple ML classifiers. Fuse modalities via ensemble voting to predict egg grade and freshness.

Result: Multimodal ensemble outperforms image-only and tabular baselines, achieving 86.57% accuracy for grade classification and 70.83% for freshness on the proposed dataset; code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: This work is, to our knowledge, the first to apply ML for internal egg quality assessment using only external, non-invasive features and to release a corresponding labeled dataset. The approach shows promise for non-destructive quality assessment and promotes reproducibility through open data and code.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting
transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

### [28] [One Patch to Caption Them All: A Unified Zero-Shot Captioning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02898)
*Lorenzo Bianchi,Giacomo Pacini,Fabio Carrara,Nicola Messina,Giuseppe Amato,Fabrizio Falchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-ioner introduces a patch-centric zero-shot captioning framework that uses dense patch representations to describe arbitrary regions without region-level supervision, achieving state-of-the-art results on zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot captioners rely on global image representations and produce only whole-image captions, limiting region-level captioning and scalability. A patch-centric approach could enable describing arbitrary regions without paired region annotations.

Method: Switch from image-centric to patch-centric captioning by treating individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregating them to describe arbitrary regions (from single patches to non-contiguous areas or full images). Use text-aligned patch features and analyze factors that enable latent captioners to work in this setup; identify dense, meaningful visual features (e.g., DINO) as crucial.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot dense captioning, region-set captioning, and a new trace captioning task. Patch-wise representations outperform baselines and competitors, highlighting the effectiveness of patch-level semantic representations for scalable caption generation.

Conclusion: Patch-level semantic representations enable scalable, region-aware captioning in a zero-shot setting and depend critically on dense patch features; this framework broadens zero-shot captioning to arbitrary regions without region-level supervision.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

*Laith Nayal,Hadi Salloum,Ahmad Taha,Yaroslav Kholodov,Alexander Gasnikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free OoD segmentation method using InternImage features, K-Means clustering, and logit confidence to separate ID/OoD; achieves strong AP on RoadAnomaly (50.02) and ADE-OoD (48.77) with InternImage-L, beating several baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is critical for safety. Foundation models offer rich features but OoD detection in segmentation is underexplored; this work investigates zero-shot OoD separation without outlier supervision.

Method: Extract features from the InternImage backbone, apply K-Means clustering to identify OoD-like clusters, and use confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to separate ID from OoD. The approach is training-free and does not use outlier labels.

Result: RoadAnomaly: 50.02 Average Precision; ADE-OoD with InternImage-L: 48.77 Average Precision. The method surpasses several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: A minimal-assumption, training-free approach can leverage foundation-model features to detect OoD regions in semantic segmentation, indicating a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation without extra data or supervision.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

### [30] [Don't Just Chase "Highlighted Tokens" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual Holistic Context Retention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02912)
*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV offers a holistic, crop-aware token pruning framework for multimodal LLMs that distributes pruning across spatial crops to preserve global visual context, outperforming attention-first pruning, especially at high pruning ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention-first token pruning tends to keep semantically similar tokens, causing representational collapse and large performance drops when many tokens are discarded. A method that maintains global context and diverse information with aggressive pruning is needed.

Method: HoloV is a plug-and-play pruning framework that adaptively distributes the pruning budget across multiple spatial crops, selecting tokens from diverse views to preserve global context rather than local saliency. It requires no special training and integrates with existing MLLMs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art pruning approaches across tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. Example: LLaVA1.5 with HoloV retains 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: A holistic, crop-based token pruning strategy effectively reduces token count while preserving task-relevant information, yielding superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs and generalizing across models and tasks.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

### [31] [Zero-Shot Robustness of Vision Language Models Via Confidence-Aware Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02913)
*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAW (Confidence-Aware Weighting) improves zero-shot robustness of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) against adversarial attacks via two components: (1) a Confidence-Aware loss that emphasizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by aligning frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on adversarial inputs. It achieves stronger robust and clean accuracy with less memory, outperforming PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR on TinyImageNet and 14 other datasets under AutoAttack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often incur high memory costs or trade off clean/generalization. There is a need for a memory-efficient method that boosts both clean accuracy and robust performance without harming generalization in zero-shot settings.

Method: Two components: (1) Confidence-Aware loss that upweights uncertain adversarial examples by scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, focusing training on hard cases; (2) feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on adversarial inputs, maintaining alignment under attack.

Result: CAW outperforms recent methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, across TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets, while using less memory.

Conclusion: CAW provides a memory-efficient, effective approach to enhance zero-shot robustness of vision-language models against adversarial attacks without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

### [32] [Multimodal Carotid Risk Stratification with Large Vision-Language Models: Benchmarking, Fine-Tuning, and Clinical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02922)
*Daphne Tsolissou,Theofanis Ganitidis,Konstantinos Mitsis,Stergios CHristodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou,Konstantina Nikita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs can aid multimodal carotid plaque risk assessment when paired with structured data, but face modality and risk-task gaps; domain-adapted LoRA models (e.g., LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna) improve stroke risk stratification, achieving competitive performance with CNN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve transparent, interpretable risk assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging with clinical, demographic, lab, and protein biomarker data using LVLMs.

Method: Evaluate open-source LVLMs (general and medically tuned) in zero-shot settings; design interview-style diagnostic sequences; domain-adapt ultrasound with LoRA (LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna); fuse multimodal tabular data as text; compare to CNN baselines on same dataset.

Result: Zero-shot: many LVLMs fail to identify imaging modality/anatomy; poor risk classification. LoRA-adapted model substantially improves stroke risk stratification; adding multimodal tabular data boosts specificity and balanced accuracy; performance competitive with CNN baselines.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise for ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction with multimodal data, but require calibration, domain adaptation, and robust data integration; still limited in modality recognition and risk-task performance; future work should focus on clinical translation.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

*Xiaoyan Kui,Qianmu Xiao,Qqinsong Li,Zexin Ji,JIelin Zhang,Beiji Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight FDA-VAE for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis that decouples shared vs independent features via symmetric latent distributions; introduces Y-shaped bidirectional training; improves efficiency and synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to separate shared and phase-specific features in multi-phase CE MRI; existing deep autoencoder-based methods are parameter-inefficient and lack interpretable training strategies.

Method: FDA-VAE encodes input and target into two latent distributions symmetric around a standard normal; decouples shared and independent features; Y-shaped bidirectional training for interpretability.

Result: Significant reduction in parameters and inference time compared to end-to-end deep autoencoders; improved synthesis quality.

Conclusion: FDA-VAE provides efficient, interpretable feature separation for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

### [34] [TIT-Score: Evaluating Long-Prompt Based Text-to-Image Alignment via Text-to-Image-to-Text Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02987)
*Juntong Wang,Huiyu Duan,Jiarui Wang,Ziheng Jia,Guangtao Zhai,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LPG-Bench introduces a long-prompt T2I benchmark and the TIT metric (T2I-T2I? actually text-to-image-to-text) for evaluating long prompts, showing TIT aligns better with human judgments than existing metrics; 7.31% absolute gain for TIT-Score-LLM; resources released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with long, detailed prompts; existing evaluation metrics poorly correlate with human preferences on long prompts. A dedicated long-prompt benchmark and a zero-shot consistency metric are needed to better assess and guide T2I alignment.

Method: Create LPG-Bench with 200 long prompts (avg >250 words). Generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models. Obtain comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Propose TIT (text-to-image-to-text) consistency metric with TIT-Score (score-based) and TIT-Score-LLM (LLM-based). Evaluate correlation with human judgments and compare against CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc.

Result: Existing T2I alignment metrics show poor consistency with human preferences on long prompts. TIT-Score-LLM achieves 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. TIT variants provide superior alignment with human judgments. LPG-Bench and TIT methods are shown to offer deeper insights for long-prompt T2I evaluation; resources will be publicly available.

Conclusion: A combined LPG-Bench and TIT framework provides a more reliable, long-prompt–aware evaluation for T2I models, guiding future model development and yield opportunities for improved alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

### [35] [Towards Scalable and Consistent 3D Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02994)
*Ruihao Xia,Yang Tang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data+model framework for 3D editing that achieves cross-view consistent, structure-preserving edits without 3D masks, via the 3DEditVerse dataset and the 3DEditFormer transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing demands local geometry/appearance edits with cross-view consistency, preserved structure, and fine-grained control. Existing methods are slow, introduce distortions, or rely on manual 3D masks that are error-prone. A scalable dataset and a structure-preserving model are needed.

Method: Data: 3DEditVerse—largest paired 3D editing benchmark with 116,309 training pairs and 1,500 test pairs, created by pose-driven geometric edits and foundation-model-guided appearance edits to ensure edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic alignment. Model: 3DEditFormer—a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer that uses dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating to disentangle editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise edits without auxiliary 3D masks.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Dataset and code will be released (Project link provided).

Conclusion: Sets a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing by pairing a large, high-quality dataset with a structure-preserving model, enabling accurate, consistent edits without manual 3D masks.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

### [36] [Geometry Meets Vision: Revisiting Pretrained Semantics in Distilled Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03104)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry-grounded semantic features in radiance fields provide finer geometric detail but do not improve semantic localization or pose inversion; visual-only semantics remain more versatile. A two-stage SPINE inversion is proposed, but geometry grounding can reduce pose accuracy; future work should craft geometry-grounding strategies that preserve versatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether geometry-grounded semantics improve geometry-aware tasks and radiance field inversion beyond visual-only semantics (e.g., CLIP, DINO) across localization and pose-estimation challenges.

Method: Compare geometry-grounded vs visual-only backbones for semantic features in Gaussian Splatting/neural radiance fields; evaluate semantic fidelity, object localization, and radiance field inversion; propose SPINE framework with coarse semantics-driven inversion followed by fine photometric optimization.

Result: Geometry-grounded features exhibit finer structural details but do not significantly improve semantic localization; pose estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features; SPINE enables radiance-field inversion without an initial guess; visual-only features offer greater versatility for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Visual-only semantic features are more versatile for downstream robotics tasks; geometry-grounded semantics provide geometric detail but require better integration strategies to avoid hurting performance; future work should develop geometry-grounding methods that enhance pose and inversion performance without sacrificing generality.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

*Sara Mobsite,Renaud Hostache,Laure Berti Equille,Emmanuel Roux,Joris Guerin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cloudy Sentinel-2 data hinder land cover segmentation; cloud injection and radar–optical fusion improve performance; injecting NDIs mitigates downsampling; results show modest gains on cloud-free and substantial gains under clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds in tropical regions degrade optical imagery for land cover semantic segmentation; need to quantify impact and explore radar data fusion and feature-preserving strategies.

Method: Develop a cloud injection algorithm to simulate realistic cloud cover; fuse Sentinel-1 radar with optical imagery; introduce a lightweight NDIs injection into final decoding layers to retain spatial details; evaluate on DFC2020 with U-Net and DeepLabV3.

Result: NDI injection yields 1.99% (U-Net) and 2.78% (DeepLabV3) gains on cloud-free imagery; under cloudy conditions, Sentinel-1 fusion yields significant gains across models compared to optical data alone.

Conclusion: Radar–optical fusion mitigates cloud-related performance losses; the NDIs injection helps preserve spatial details with minimal computation; together, these approaches improve LCS in cloud-prone regions.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

### [38] [Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135)
*Gen Li,Bo Zhao,Jianfei Yang,Laura Sevilla-Lara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV introduces an interaction-centric video generation framework that eliminates the need for dense mask annotations by using a decoupled two-stage pipeline: (1) predict plausible motion trajectories for the actor and object, (2) generate video conditioned on these trajectories. It offers intuitive control (target object, action descriptions, spatial cues) and provides two benchmarks for human-object interaction and robotic manipulation, reporting superior realism and controllability over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a strong demand for realistic interaction-centric videos to support embodied intelligence, robot learning, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods rely on dense mask annotations that are expensive and impractical for real-world use, making it hard to model complex, dynamic interactions. Mask2IV aims to remove this bottleneck while preserving controllability.

Method: A decoupled two-stage pipeline. Stage 1 predicts plausible motion trajectories for both the actor and the object; Stage 2 generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. The framework does not require dense mask annotations and supports intuitive control by letting users specify the target object and guide motion via action descriptions or spatial cues. The authors also curate two benchmarks spanning diverse action/object categories for human–object interaction and robotic manipulation, used to train and evaluate the approach.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior visual realism and controllability compared with existing baselines, across the proposed benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mask2IV advances interaction-centric video generation by removing the need for dense masks, enabling controllable interaction dynamics, and providing standardized benchmarks for systematic evaluation in human–object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

TL;DR: PocketSR provides ultra-lightweight RealSR with LiteED VAE replacement, online annealing pruning, and feature distillation; 146M params; 4K 0.8s; competitive with SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image SR on edge devices demands high quality while maintaining low latency; current large generative models are impractical; propose lightweight generative RealSR.

Method: Replace heavy VAE with LiteED to cut 97.5% parameters; apply online annealing pruning to U-Net to shift from heavy to light priors; use multi-layer feature distillation to preserve knowledge during pruning; analyze each component.

Result: Model size 146M; processes 4K images in 0.8 seconds; performance on par with SOTA single-step and competitive with multi-step RealSR models; shows practical edge deployment.

Conclusion: PocketSR demonstrates feasible, efficient, high-quality RealSR on edge devices; the design choices offer insights for future research in lightweight generative SR.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEve introduces a self-curated prompt suite to evaluate multi-event text-to-video generation, studying OpenSora and CogVideoX; key insight is that early denoising intervention and block-wise model layers control event transitions, informing future multi-event conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of analysis on how multi-event prompts affect event shifting in T2V generation, and to establish an evaluation framework for temporal control in multi-event videos.

Method: Develop MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event T2V; perform a systematic study on two model families (OpenSora and CogVideoX); conduct extensive experiments focusing on denoising steps and block-wise model layers to understand when/where event transitions are controlled.

Result: Findings show that early intervention in denoising steps and the configuration of block-wise layers are crucial for enabling clean multi-event video generation; demonstrates the importance of prompt timing and architecture in multi-event conditioning; provides insights applicable to future models.

Conclusion: Understanding the locus of event control is essential for multi-event T2V; MEve offers a valuable evaluation framework; results point to design considerations (early denoising, layer-wise conditioning) for improving future multi-event video generation models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,

### [42] [What Drives Compositional Generalization in Visual Generative Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03075)
*Karim Farid,Rajat Sahay,Yumna Ali Alnaggar,Simon Schrodi,Volker Fischer,Cordelia Schmid,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study shows discrete vs continuous training objectives and conditioning depth jointly shape compositional generalization in image/video generation; augmenting discrete models (e.g., MaskGIT) with a continuous JEPA-based auxiliary objective improves compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is essential for visual generative models, but its enabling factors are not fully understood. The paper aims to identify design choices that positively or negatively affect compositional generalization in image and video generation.

Method: Controlled experiments that vary (1) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution and (2) how much conditioning information about the constituent concepts is provided during training. The study also demonstrates that relaxing MaskGIT's discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance for discrete models.

Result: Two key factors influence compositional generalization: (i) the discreteness vs continuity of the training objective, and (ii) the extent to which conditioning conveys information about the constituents during training. Additionally, introducing a continuous JEPA-based auxiliary objective to discrete models like MaskGIT improves compositional performance.

Conclusion: Design choices in objective type and conditioning materially impact compositional generalization in image/video generation. For discrete models, combining a discrete loss with a continuous JEPA-based objective can enhance compositional generalization, offering a practical route to improve performance on compositional tasks.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

### [43] [Latent Diffusion Unlearning: Protecting Against Unauthorized Personalization Through Trajectory Shifted Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03089)
*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a latent-space perturbation defense for text-to-image diffusion models that makes training samples unlearnable for personalization by shifting the diffusion denoising trajectory in latent diffusion models, without sacrificing visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect raw data from unauthorized model inversion, IP theft, and unwanted personalization by making samples resistant to downstream diffusion-model personalization while preserving perceptual quality.

Method: Introduce a model-based perturbation in the latent space of latent diffusion models. The approach alternates between denoising and inversion and shifts the starting point of the denoising trajectory in the diffusion process, producing perturbed inputs that remain visually faithful but resist inversion and personalization.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows improved imperceptibility (about 8–10% across PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness (about 10% average across five adversarial settings) against state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: Latent-space perturbations integrated into LDMs can provide practical, imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation, offering a viable approach to safeguard sensitive data in diffusion-model ecosystems.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

### [44] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete uses geometry-guided diffusion with a dual-branch architecture and target-aware masking to enable reference-driven image completion with strong geometric consistency, achieving large PSNR gains over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based image completion approaches rely solely on diffusion priors and lack explicit geometric cues (e.g., camera pose, depth). When target viewpoints differ from references, results can be misaligned or implausible. There is a need for 3D structural guidance to enforce geometric consistency in completed regions.

Method: A geometry-conditioned diffusion framework with two branches: (1) a target-branch that synthesizes missing regions from a masked target, and (2) a geometry-branch that extracts geometric features from projected point clouds. These branches share information via joint self-attention. The method also uses target-aware masking by projecting the target view into each reference to identify occluded areas and mask them during training, guiding the model to leverage useful cues. This yields a unified, geometry-aware diffusion process for image completion.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows GeoComplete achieves about 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, indicating significantly better geometric accuracy while preserving high visual quality.

Conclusion: Integrating geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion with target-aware masking provides a robust framework for geometry-conditioned image completion, outperforming prior image-only approaches in both alignment and quality.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HVGC + BridgeDiT for Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV), disentangling captions to avoid modal interference and using Dual CrossAttention in a dual-tower diffusion transformer to synchronize video and audio, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address modal interference from using a single shared caption for video and audio and unclear cross-modal interaction mechanism; need robust cross-modal info exchange to ensure semantic and temporal alignment.

Method: HVGC framework generates disentangled video and audio captions from text; BridgeDiT is a dual-tower diffusion transformer with Dual CrossAttention to facilitate bidirectional information exchange between modalities and captions, enabling synchronization.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks with human evaluations show state-of-the-art on most metrics; ablations validate contributions; code/checkpoints to be released.

Conclusion: HVGC + BridgeDiT effectively mitigate interference and enable synchronization; the approach advances T2SV research; release of resources will aid reproducibility.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR introduces a brain-inspired, two-branch reconstruction pipeline that splits the visual cortex into Structural and Semantic regions, extracting structural priors and CLIP-based semantics to guide a diffusion model for improved image reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural scene reconstruction from brain activity is limited by low-level feature heterogeneity and high-level semantic entanglement. A hierarchy-inspired approach aims to disentangle structure and semantics to improve reconstruction quality.

Method: The model divides the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions. The Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors. The Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image.

Result: HAVIR enhances both structural and semantic aspects of reconstructions, performing better than existing models, especially in complex scenes.

Conclusion: A cortical-hierarchy inspired two-branch framework can improve brain-to-image reconstructions by explicitly disentangling structural and semantic information and guiding diffusion-based synthesis.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Motivation: Accurate human mobility modeling is essential for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management, and there is a need to capture both consistent daily routines and variability in behavior while being scalable.

Method: A probabilistic topological framework (Markovian Reeb Graphs) that integrates individual- and population-level mobility structures to learn Patterns of Life from baseline data and generate future trajectories.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Urban Anomalies (Atlanta and Berlin) using Jensen-Shannon Divergence shows high fidelity at both population- and agent-level metrics while being data- and compute-efficient.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, general framework for realistic trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpineMed presents SpineMed-450k, a large, vertebral-level, multimodal spine dataset with an accompanying SpineBench evaluation framework, built via clinician-guided two-stage LLM generation. Fine-tuning on this data improves vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities, surpassing baseline LVLMs, with clinician-assessed diagnostic utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for level-aware, multimodal spine datasets and benchmarks to support accurate vertebral-level decision-making across X-ray, CT, and MRI. Current progress is hindered by non-traceable instruction data and spine-specific benchmarks.

Method: Curate SpineMed-450k from textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation (draft and revision). Develop SpineBench as a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. Evaluate recent LVLMs on SpineBench; fine-tune a model on SpineMed-450k.

Result: LVLMs show systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. A model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k achieves consistent, significant improvements across level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning tasks. Clinician assessments confirm diagnostic clarity and practical utility of the outputs.

Conclusion: SpineMed provides a scalable, clinically-grounded resource for vertebral-level multimodal reasoning, and SpineBench offers a clinically relevant evaluation. The approach yields improved model performance and demonstrated real-world utility in spine diagnostics.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

TL;DR: UniShield is a multi-agent unified system for detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering adaptive, interpretable reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forgery detectors are domain-specific and poorly generalizable; there is a need for an integrated framework that can adapt to multiple forgery types and domains to preserve information integrity and security.

Method: A two-agent architecture: a perception agent that analyzes image features to select suitable detectors, and a detection agent that combines multiple expert detectors into a unified framework and produces interpretable forgery reports across domains (image manipulation, document manipulation, DeepFake, AI-generated images).

Result: Extensive experiments show UniShield achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both domain-specific detectors and existing unified approaches, with strong practicality, adaptability, and scalability.

Conclusion: UniShield provides an effective, scalable solution for cross-domain forgery detection and localization, enabling robust integrity verification in real-world diverse scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Motivation: Relightable 3D reconstruction under novel lighting without costly per-illumination optimization or full light transport, enabling realistic and efficient relighting from multi-view captures.

Method: Sample appearances under diverse lighting environments to build a training dataset; train a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) conditioned on environment lighting; employ a dual-branch network to separately encode general lighting effects and specularities; enable fast, feed-forward relighting without per-illumination optimization.

Result: Evaluated on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets, achieving state-of-the-art improvements on most metrics; demonstrated effective results on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: ROGR provides an efficient and accurate relighting framework for 3D objects under arbitrary environment maps, eliminating the need for per-illumination optimization or explicit light transport during inference.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

### [51] [Dynamic Prompt Generation for Interactive 3D Medical Image Segmentation Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03189)
*Tidiane Camaret Ndir,Alexander Pfefferle,Robin Tibor Schirrmeister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training strategy for interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation that uses dynamic volumetric prompt generation and content-aware adaptive cropping to make efficient use of the image encoder, while simulating realistic user interactions during training and enabling single-GPU learning. Initial weights are from nnInteractive, with evaluation on a foundation-models competition showing competitive Dice and surface-distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for interactive 3D segmentation struggle with volumetric awareness and limited interactive capabilities. Efficiently training to handle sequential user refinements on 3D data on limited hardware is a key challenge.

Method: Train a model with dynamic volumetric prompts and content-aware adaptive cropping to maximize encoder utility; simulate realistic user interaction patterns during training; address sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU; initialize from nnInteractive weights.

Result: On the Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation competition, the approach achieved an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized surface distance of 0.6614, and reported AUC metrics of 2.4799 (Dice) and 2.5671 (NSD).

Conclusion: The proposed strategy yields competitive quantitative performance for interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation and demonstrates effective use of prompt dynamics and cropping to drive efficient training on limited hardware.

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that
can iteratively refine predictions based on user prompts. Current foundation
models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive
capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric
prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of
the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models
for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates
strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized
surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice)
and 2.5671 (NSD).

*Denis Zavadski,Nikita Philip Tatsch,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQGAN introduces a quantized image autoencoder by integrating Product Quantization (PQ) into the VQGAN framework, achieving substantial reconstruction gains and enabling efficient diffusion-based image generation, with guidance on hyperparameters and dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve reconstruction quality and efficiency for latent representations in high-fidelity image generation, and extend discrete latent quantization to diffusion-based pipelines.

Method: Incorporate Product Quantization into the VQGAN pipeline (PQGAN), analyze interactions among codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation; treat vector and scalar quantisation as special cases; validate via integration with pre-trained diffusion models.

Result: Significant performance gains: PSNR improved to 37dB (vs 27dB baseline); reductions of FID, LPIPS, and CMMD by up to 96%; uncovering that PQ and VQ react oppositely to embedding dimension scaling; provide hyperparameter guidance; enables faster and/or higher-resolution generation when integrated with diffusion models.

Conclusion: PQ is a strong extension for discrete latent representations in image synthesis, and PQGAN offers substantial reconstruction improvements and practical benefits when paired with diffusion models, including faster generation or higher output resolution at no extra cost.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

*Junchao Huang,Xinting Hu,Boyao Han,Shaoshuai Shi,Zhuotao Tian,Tianyu He,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory Forcing introduces a geometry-indexed spatial memory framework for autoregressive video diffusion, pairing targeted training protocols with memory modules to boost long-term spatial consistency and generative quality under limited context, while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under finite context windows, purely temporal memory struggles to maintain spatial consistency across revisits, while rich spatial memory risks degrading new-scene generation. The work seeks to balance temporal exploration with spatial reuse.

Method: Propose Memory Forcing with (1) Hybrid Training to separate exploration (temporal memory) from revisits (spatial memory), (2) Chained Forward Training using model rollouts to create larger pose variations and promote spatial memory usage, (3) Point-to-Frame Retrieval to map visible points to their source frames, and (4) Incremental 3D Reconstruction to maintain and update an explicit 3D cache, all built on a geometry-indexed spatial memory.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, with maintained computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Conclusion: Memory Forcing provides a practical, scalable framework for robust world modeling in autoregressive video diffusion, leveraging both temporal and spatial cues to sustain coherence over long horizons without sacrificing new-scene fidelity.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

*Luca Collorone,Matteo Gioia,Massimiliano Pappa,Paolo Leoni,Giovanni Ficarra,Or Litany,Indro Spinelli,Fabio Galasso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonSTeR is a unified Motion-Scene-Text Retrieval model that embeds motion, text, and scene into a shared latent space for robust cross-modal retrieval, enabling zero-shot tasks and validated by human-aligned scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of tools to evaluate and leverage the alignment between skeletal motion, textual intention, and scene context; a unified higher-order representation can enable flexible retrieval across modalities.

Method: Build a shared latent space by combining unimodal and cross-modal representations, capturing higher-order relations among motion, text, and scene; validate via retrieval benchmarks, a human study, and zero-shot tasks (in-scene object placement, motion captioning); release code and models.

Result: MonSTeR outperforms trimodal models that rely only on unimodal representations; retrieval scores align with human preferences; latent space enables zero-shot in-scene object placement and motion captioning.

Conclusion: MonSTeR demonstrates effective joint modeling of motion, scene, and text, enabling versatile, robust retrieval and downstream tasks, with user-aligned validation and open-source resources.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free test-time defense that uses stochastic resonance via small input translations to bolster robustness against adversarial perturbations, without extra training or modules, applicable across architectures and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome information loss from feature filtering/smoothing; provide universal, training-free defense that works across vision tasks, including dense prediction.

Method: Apply small translational perturbations to the input, align the resulting feature embeddings, and aggregate them to produce a final prediction; this closed-form transformation requires no additional network components or fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, generic test-time defense for stereo matching and optical flow; recovers up to 68.1% of accuracy loss in classification, 71.9% in stereo matching, and 29.2% in optical flow under various attacks.

Conclusion: The approach is training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic, offering versatile, practical defense across tasks with minimal overhead.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: Mixer: a randomized neural network with hyperspherical embeddings and a dual-branch module to capture intra- and inter-channel texture relationships, delivering strong results on texture benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elevate architecture-level aspects of randomized networks for texture representation, addressing the gap where previous work focused on cross-information prediction rather than architectural innovations.

Method: Proposes Mixer, which uses hyperspherical random embeddings and a dual-branch learning module to model intra- and inter-channel relationships, aided by a novel optimization formulation for rich texture representations.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multiple pure texture benchmarks show promising/interesting results, indicating the approach's potential in texture representation tasks.

Conclusion: Mixer advances the architectural design of randomized networks for texture learning and sets the stage for future refinements; source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code
will be available upon publication.

*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RULER tokens and Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improve GUI grounding by giving explicit spatial cues and balanced width-height encoding, yielding consistent gains on high-resolution displays across ScreenSpot datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI grounding via vision-language models struggles with patch-to-pixel mapping at unseen resolutions. Implicit coordinate generation fails to extrapolate to high-res screens, causing accuracy drops and failures in GUI automation.

Method: Introduce RULER tokens as explicit coordinate markers to reference gridline-like positions in the visual input, allowing the model to adjust locations rather than generate from scratch. Pair this with Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) to ensure width and height dimensions are encoded with equal emphasis, addressing asymmetry in standard positional schemes. Integrate into existing VLM-based grounding pipelines and evaluate on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro.

Result: Consistent gains in grounding accuracy across ScreenSpot variants, with the largest improvements observed on high-resolution interfaces, indicating better generalization to unseen resolutions and platforms.

Conclusion: Providing explicit spatial guidance through RULER tokens and balanced spatial encoding via I-MRoPE yields more reliable GUI grounding and automation across diverse resolutions, reducing failures when extrapolating to high-resolution displays.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

TL;DR: LEAML: a label-efficient adaptation framework for multimodal LLMs in specialized domains that uses pseudo QA pairs and selective neuron updates, achieving better VQA performance with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs perform poorly on out-of-distribution, domain-specific tasks (e.g., medical imaging) due to scarce labeled data; a label-efficient approach leveraging unlabeled data is needed.

Method: Generate domain-relevant QA pairs from unlabeled images with a QA generator regularized by caption distillation; selectively update neurons most relevant to QA to efficiently acquire domain knowledge during distillation.

Result: In GI endoscopy and sports VQA, LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision.

Conclusion: LEAML provides effective label-efficient domain adaptation for MLLMs by combining pseudo QA data and targeted parameter updates, improving performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML
framework.

### [59] [Local Routing on a Convex Polytope in R^3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02856)
*Sreehari Chandran,R. Inkulu*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Presents a geometry-based routing scheme on convex 3D polytopes that preprocesses per-vertex tables to route between any two vertices with small amortized storage and a provable stretch bound on path length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable distributed routing on polyhedral surfaces (like networked meshes on a polytope) with guaranteed routing decisions using local information and header data, while keeping per-vertex memory small and ensuring near-shortest paths.

Method: Preprocess the convex polytope P (n vertices) to compute routing tables at every vertex. The preprocessing runs in O(n + min(n^3, 1/epsilon^7)) time. Each vertex stores O(min(n, 1/epsilon^{3/2})) bits amortized. The boundary ∂P is partitioned into 1/epsilon^3 geodesic cells of equal size; D bounds the maximum diagonal length within any cell; theta_m is half the minimum angle between neighboring boundary edges. Routing uses the local table at the current vertex and the packet header to select the next hop; the path length is bounded by (8+epsilon)/sin(theta_m) * (D + d(s,t)).

Result: A full preprocessing-based routing scheme on convex polytopes supporting routing between arbitrary vertex pairs with per-vertex storage and a provable stretch factor depending on geometric parameters. The algorithm guarantees a polynomial-time preprocessing and a deterministic bound on the route length relative to the true geodesic distance plus a cell-related term.

Conclusion: The paper delivers a scalable, local-routing scheme on convex polyhedra with deterministic guarantees: small per-vertex storage, polynomial preprocessing, and a provable stretch bound that scales with geometric conditions of the polytope.

Abstract: Given a convex polytope $P$ defined with $n$ vertices in $\mathbb{R}^3$, this
paper presents an algorithm to preprocess $P$ to compute routing tables at
every vertex of $P$ so that a data packet can be routed on $P$ from any vertex
of $P$ to any other vertex of $P$. At every vertex $v$ of $P$ along the routing
path, until the packet reaches its destination, the next hop is determined
using the routing tables at $v$ and the information stored in the packet
header. In $O(n+\min(n^3, \frac{1}{\epsilon^7}))$ time, the preprocessing
algorithm computes a routing table at every vertex of $P$ of amortized size
$O(\min(n, \frac{1}{\epsilon^{3/2}}))$ bits. If the optimal shortest distance
between $s$ and $t$ on $P$ is $d(s, t)$, then the routing path produced by this
algorithm has length at most $\frac{8+\epsilon}{\sin{\theta_m}}(D+d(s,t))$.
Here, $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is an input parameter, $D$ is the maximum length of
the diagonal of any cell when $\partial P$ is partitioned into
$\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}$ geodesic cells of equal size, and $\theta_m$ is half the
minimum angle between any two neighbouring edges of $P$ on $\partial P$.

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data augmentation with GANs and SMOTE improves extreme value forecasting with Conv-LSTM/BD-LSTM; SMOTE shows consistent gains; Conv-LSTM is strong for periodic data, BD-LSTM for chaotic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme value forecasting is challenging due to imbalanced tail events. Augmenting data with GANs/SMOTE aims to boost deep learning performance for multistep forecasts and extreme-region accuracy, using relevance-based extreme incorporation.

Method: Build an augmentation framework using GANs and SMOTE, apply Conv-LSTM and BD-LSTM for multi-step ahead forecasting, compare augmentation methods, evaluate accuracy overall and at extremes, and assess computational efficiency. Introduce relevance-function-based strategies for incorporating extreme values.

Result: SMOTE-based augmentation consistently provided superior adaptability and improved performance across short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM excelled on periodic/stable data, while BD-LSTM performed better on chaotic/non-stationary sequences; augmentation strategies varied in efficiency.

Conclusion: Data augmentation with SMOTE and GANs can improve extreme value forecasting with deep learning. SMOTE is particularly robust across settings; different architectures offer complementary strengths, suggesting careful pairing of augmentation strategy with data characteristics and possibly relevance-based extreme handling.

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpenTSLM introduces Time Series Language Models that treat time series as a native modality, enabling reasoning over multi-time-series data. Two architectures—SoftPrompt and Flamingo—achieve strong results on clinical time-series tasks, with memory advantages for Flamingo and competitive performance even at 1B params, and all resources are open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs typically struggle with time-series data, yet clinical settings require integrating long, heterogeneous temporal data for actionable insights. There is a need for scalable architectures that natively handle time-series within LLMs without resorting to treating them as static text.

Method: Propose OpenTSLM family with two architectures: (1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, implicit time-series modeling by prepending learnable time-series tokens to text via soft prompting; (2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo, explicit time-series modeling via cross-attention to fuse time-series with text. Evaluate on three CoT datasets (HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, ECG-QA-CoT) against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots. Comparison includes parameter-efficient setups (and 1B-parameter scales). Memory analysis shows SoftPrompt scales poorly with sequence length; Flamingo offers stable memory. Clinician expert reviews assess reasoning on ECG-QA. All code, data, and models are open-source.

Result: OpenTSLM models outperform baselines across tasks, achieving 69.9 F1 on Sleep-CoT and 65.4 on HAR-CoT (vs 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models). Even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o on these tasks (scores 15.47 and 2.95). Flamingo matches SoftPrompt in overall performance and better handles longer sequences, with memory advantages over SoftPrompt (SoftPrompt ~110 GB vs Flamingo ~40 GB VRAM for ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B). Expert clinician reviews corroborate strong reasoning in ECG-QA.

Conclusion: Incorporating time series as a native modality within LLMs yields substantial gains for multimodal clinical reasoning, with two viable architectures offering trade-offs between explicit modeling and parameter efficiency. The approach scales to long sequences and is supported by open resources, enabling further research in time-series-capable LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

*Lin Chen,Jun Chen,Minghui Qiu,Shuxin Zhong,Binghong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer uses a structure-aware, physics-informed two-stage pipeline to reconstruct high-res rainfall from radar; treats radar structure as a prior; achieves >13% MAE improvement on two public datasets via Structure-to-Point Mapper and Geo-Aware Rain Decoder with a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial interpolation methods based on AWS or satellite/radar data often smooth out sharp rainfall structures and miss localized extremes. A physics-informed approach that leverages radar-derived structural priors and bridges aloft hydro-meteors with ground-level precipitation can improve reconstruction fidelity for flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis.

Method: Two-stage architecture: (1) Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall via a bidirectional mapping; (2) Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the semantic transformation during descent (melting, evaporation) using a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. The system is evaluated on two public datasets (RAIN-F Korea 2017-2019; MeteoNet France 2016-2018) and compared against state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: Consistent improvements over baselines; reduction in MAE by over 13.31%; enhanced structural fidelity of reconstructed rainfall fields.

Conclusion: RainSeer demonstrates the viability of interpreting radar reflectivity as a structural prior for reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields. The two-stage, physics-informed approach improves fidelity and may benefit flood forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

### [63] [How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02453)
*Parth Asawa,Alan Zhu,Matei Zaharia,Alexandros G. Dimakis,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advisor Models are lightweight RL-tuned policies that steer black-box foundation models in-context on a per-input basis, improving adaptability, transferability, and robustness compared to static prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static prompts fail to adapt to diverse inputs, users, and environments. There is a need for per-instance control and environment-aware customization for black-box models.

Method: Train a small policy (advisor) using reinforcement learning to emit natural-language steering instructions in-context before the black-box model; leverage environment reward signals to shape behavior; evaluate across reasoning and personalization domains; test transferability of advisors across different black-box models and assess robustness to out-of-distribution inputs.

Result: Advisor models outperform static prompt optimizers; learn environment dynamics; improve downstream task performance; demonstrate transfer across black-box models; achieve specialization while retaining OOD robustness.

Conclusion: Dynamic, environment-aware optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising approach for personalization and environment-adaptable AI; advisors act as parametric, environment-specific memory enabling enhanced capabilities without changing model weights.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

### [64] [Market-Based Data Subset Selection -- Principled Aggregation of Multi-Criteria Example Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02456)
*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A market-based data selector using an LMSR cost-function prediction market prices each training example by utility, with signals as traders, a single liquidity knob, topic normalization, and a per-token price rule to manage token budgets. A diversity head improves coverage. The approach yields a maximum-entropy, convex aggregation framework with interpretable knobs, achieving competitive or parity performance with low overhead on GSM8K and AGNews while improving balance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting a small, useful subset of training data is hard due to heterogeneous utility signals (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) and ad hoc weighting. A unified, principled framework with interpretable controls and low compute is desirable for reliable data curation.

Method: Model training data selection via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR). Signals act as traders pricing each example. A single liquidity parameter controls market concentration; topic-wise normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled with a price-per-token rule rho = p / ell^gamma, where gamma induces a length bias. A lightweight diversity head boosts coverage. Coverage is quantified via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. Theoretical result shows LMSR implements maximum-entropy aggregation with exponential weighting and a convex objective. Empirical evaluation on GSM8K (60k-token budget) and AGNews (kept=5-25%) demonstrates competitive performance with low overhead and improved balance/stability.

Result: The market with diversity matches strong single-signal baselines on GSM8K while reducing seed variance and incurring less than 0.1 GPU-hours of selection overhead. On AGNews, the market with light balancing delivers competitive accuracy with improved balance and stability.

Conclusion: A unified, principled data curation framework under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification, leveraging multi-signal signals with LMSR-based pricing and diversity-aware calibration.

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

### [65] [Assessing the Potential for Catastrophic Failure in Dynamic Post-Training Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02457)
*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-training quantization can drastically fail under certain input distributions; using knowledge distillation and RL, the paper finds detrimental network-policy pairs causing large accuracy drops (10-65%), contrasting with more robust setups; highlights vulnerability hotspots and safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ reduces compute and memory but may degrade performance depending on inputs; safety-critical deployments require understanding worst-case behavior and robustness of quantized models.

Method: Formulates a joint knowledge-distillation and reinforcement-learning framework to learn a network and bit-width policy that maximize worst-case failure under quantization; conducts systematic experiments to identify vulnerable configurations and analyze input distribution effects.

Result: Demonstrates existence of detrimental network-policy pairs with substantial accuracy degradation (10-65%), while some robust configurations show <2% drop; provides initial mapping of high-risk input regimes; confirms need for caution.

Conclusion: PTQ robustness must be studied more rigorously; safety considerations should guide deployment; future work should investigate characterization of failure modes and defenses against extreme PTQ-induced failures.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

*Ashish Jha,Salman Ahmadi-Asl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE is a streaming data-subset selection method using a Frequent Directions sketch to maintain gradient geometry with constant memory, enabling a two-pass, GPU-friendly training pipeline that retains competitive accuracy with reduced compute and memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and energy intensive; there is a need for memory-efficient, scalable data-subset selection that preserves gradient information without storing large gradient or pairwise similarity matrices.

Method: Maintain a Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry in O(ℓ D) memory. Stream gradients, compute a consensus direction, and score examples by alignment of their sketched gradients with this consensus. Select a subset to train, avoiding N×N pairwise similarities and explicit N×ℓ gradient storage. Two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline with deterministic FD guarantees; analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within the principal sketched subspace.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with small kept-rate budgets while achieving competitive accuracy relative to full-data training and recent subset baselines, while reducing end-to-end compute and peak memory. It offers a practical, constant-memory alternative that reduces resource usage and complements pruning/model compression.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a practical, constant-memory approach for efficient training that scales to large datasets and complements existing efficiency techniques like pruning and model compression.

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

### [67] [Uncertainty-Guided Model Selection for Tabular Foundation Models in Biomolecule Efficacy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02476)
*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uncertainty-guided ensembling with TabPFN improves siRNA efficacy prediction by using model uncertainty (IQR) to select low-uncertainty models; the approach can outperform naive ensembling and even single models, showing uncertainty as a label-free heuristic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective model ensembling in-context learning for biomolecule efficacy prediction without ground-truth labels by leveraging model uncertainty as a selection criterion.

Method: Apply TabPFN with simple sequence-based features to an siRNA knockdown efficacy task. Compute the predicted inter-quantile range (IQR) as a measure of model uncertainty. Form an ensemble by selecting models with the lowest mean IQR and averaging their predictions. Compare against naive ensembling and a single model trained on all data.

Result: The low-IQR ensemble achieves superior predictive performance compared to naive ensembling and a single-model baseline. The TabPFN model with simple sequence features can outperform specialized state-of-the-art predictors on this task. The model’s predicted IQR negatively correlates with true prediction error, supporting its use as a label-free uncertainty signal.

Conclusion: Uncertainty information from in-context learners provides a powerful, label-free heuristic for selecting models in ensembling for biomolecule efficacy predictions, enabling improved performance without access to ground-truth labels.

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Litespark proposes targeted architectural and algorithmic optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers to boost pretraining efficiency, achieving 2x-6x training throughput and 55%-83% energy reduction on 3B and 30B Llama models (SlimPajama-627B). The approach claims model- and hardware-agnostic applicability and extends to post-training stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is prohibitively time- and energy-intensive, requiring months of compute and large electricity consumption. There is a need to increase MFU (Model FLOPs Utilization) to reduce wasted compute while preserving compatibility with standard transformers.

Method: Introduce Litespark with architectural and algorithmic optimizations focused on transformer attention and MLP layers to improve MFU. Optimizations are designed to be model- and hardware-agnostic and compatible with existing transformer implementations. Benchmarking conducted on 3B and 30B Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset across multi-node H200 GPUs.

Result: Substantial performance gains reported: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and 55%-83% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 clusters for 3B and 30B Llama models on SlimPajama-627B.

Conclusion: Optimizations are claimed to be model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad

*Rafael Rodriguez-Sanchez,Cameron Allen,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACF is a contrastive learning method that discovers independently controllable latent factors from high-dimensional observations, enabling factorized MDP structure without prior knowledge; it recovers ground-truth controllable factors on Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey and consistently outperforms baseline disentanglement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between sample-efficient factored-MDP methods and deep RL by learning a factored latent representation directly from observations, without assuming a known factorization.

Method: Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF) uses a contrastive objective to identify latent state components that actions can influence independently. It leverages sparsity (each action affects only a subset of variables) so the rest follow the environment dynamics, enabling learning from pixel data and recovering controllable factors from observations.

Result: ACF recovers the ground-truth controllable factors on three benchmarks with known factored structure and consistently outperforms baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Conclusion: ACF demonstrates that controllable latent factors can be discovered from high-dimensional observations, enabling factored representations and potential sample-efficiency gains without requiring a priori factorization; promising for integrating factored MDP ideas with deep RL.

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

*Shaifalee Saxena,Alan Williams,Rafael Fierro,Alexander Scheinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid ES-DRL controller improves robustness and tracking for time-varying nonlinear systems; validated numerically and for automatic tuning of LANL accelerator's LEBT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL can leverage large datasets for fast control but is brittle when system dynamics change rapidly; bounded extremum seeking (ES) handles time-varying systems with unknown control directions but can be slow and prone to local minima. A hybrid approach could combine fast learning with robustness to variation.

Method: Proposes a hybrid controller that combines model-independent bounded ES with deep reinforcement learning. DRL leverages historical data to drive the system to a desired setpoint, while bounded ES provides robustness to time variations and uncertain control directions. Demonstrated through numerical study on a general time-varying system and a case of automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) section at LANL's linear accelerator.

Result: The ES-DRL hybrid outperforms each component alone, with performance exceeding the sum of its parts (superadditive). Demonstrated on a general time-varying system and applied to automatic tuning of the LANL LEBT, showing improved robustness and rapid convergence.

Conclusion: The ES-DRL hybrid is a promising approach for robust, data-driven control of time-varying nonlinear systems, validated numerically and in a high-energy physics accelerator context; suggests potential for broader applications and future real-time implementations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

*Jiangnan Li,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT is equivalent to inverse RL; it learns a dense token-level reward and can be augmented with RL (Dense-Path REINFORCE) to outperform plain SFT on instruction-following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret supervised fine-tuning as reward learning, enabling granular credit assignment and leveraging expert demonstrations for RL improvements.

Method: Prove that SFT objective is a special case of inverse Q-learning; derive a baseline-relative dense reward from the SFT model; extract this reward; apply Dense-Path REINFORCE to fine-tune; evaluate on instruction-following benchmarks.

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE consistently outperforms original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: SFT should be viewed as a reward-learning process, not just imitation; dense reward signals enable new ways to leverage demonstrations and improve policy via RL.

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a residual-learning framework that trains across multiple crossbar tiles to offset low-precision (≈4-bit) weight updates in analog in-memory computing; achieves linear convergence and outperforms prior methods with moderate hardware overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between memristor devices' limited update precision (~4-bit) and the need for accurate on-chip training, avoiding heavy noise mitigation and energy costs associated with higher-precision schemes.

Method: Sequentially learning on multiple crossbar tiles (residual learning) to compensate residual errors from low-precision weight updates; provides theoretical analysis showing optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and linear convergence; validates on standard image classification benchmarks; includes cost analysis of hardware overhead.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings; demonstrates linear convergence; shows moderate hardware overhead verified by cost analysis.

Conclusion: Residual multi-tile training enables effective on-chip learning with limited-state memristive devices, offering improved accuracy with acceptable hardware costs and indicating practical viability for AIMC in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Spectral Geodesic Flow Matching (SFMG) to generate graphs by embedding input and target graphs via spectral eigenmaps into continuous manifolds, modeling geodesic flows between embeddings, and matching distributions along these flows for scalable graph synthesis; achieves competitive performance with substantial speedups and generalizes to unseen scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph generation methods often align spectrum or degree profiles but neglect the eigenvector geometry and global structure, limiting expressive power and scalability.

Method: Embed graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds using spectral eigenmaps; define geodesic flows between embeddings; perform distribution matching along these flows to produce output graphs.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art on graphlet, degree, and spectral metrics across benchmarks; up to 30× speedup compared to diffusion-based models; scales efficiently and generalizes to unseen graph scales.

Conclusion: Integrates spectral geometry with flow matching to provide a scalable, geometry-aware graph generational framework beyond eigenvalue alignment.

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

*Imran Thobani,Javier Sagastuy-Brena,Aran Nayebi,Jacob Prince,Rosa Cao,Daniel Yamins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) as the strictest, bidirectional mapping to compare model activations and brain responses across subjects; demonstrates its ability to reveal mechanistic details and support TDANNs without sacrificing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus on how to compare artificial model activations with brain data. A principled, cross-subject mapping framework is needed to assess both predictive accuracy and mechanistic validity of brain models.

Method: Define IATC as the minimal, invertible function class to map neural responses between subjects. Apply bidirectional IATC-based transforms to link a candidate model's responses with brain data in three settings: simulated neural networks, mouse subjects, and human subjects; evaluate both predictive accuracy and mechanistic specificity.

Result: IATC captures detailed neural mechanisms (e.g., nonlinear activation functions) and enables accurate model-brain predictions while maintaining high specificity to distinguish mechanisms. It can separate response patterns across brain areas while aligning same-area responses across subjects, showing no inherent tradeoff between predictive power and mechanistic identifiability. TDANNs receive new supporting evidence under IATC-guided comparisons.

Conclusion: IATC offers a principled framework for model-brain comparisons, clarifying previous findings about DL models in neuroscience and improving on prior methods. It strengthens the case for TDANNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for integrated representation learning, risk prediction, and subtype identification in longitudinal wearable sleep data, enabling interpretable temporal explanations of risk.

Method: Proposes AttentiveGRUAE: a gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder with attention; a binary classifier head for end-of-period depression prediction; and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) over the latent embeddings for soft clustering. Trained jointly with multi-objective loss on daily behavioral features from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019) and validated on cross-year data (332 participants, GLOBEM 2020-2021).

Result: Outperforms baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablations in clustering quality (silhouette 0.70 vs 0.32–0.70) and depression classification (AUC 0.74 vs 0.50–0.67) on the primary cohort; external validation shows cluster reproducibility (silhouette 0.63) and moderate AUC (0.61); temporal attention highlights sleep-related differences and identifies salient windows aligned with changes in sleep regularity, offering interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: A multi-task, attention-enhanced latent representation learning framework yields compact, informative embeddings that support clustering, outcome prediction, and interpretable temporal analysis in longitudinal wearable sleep data, with evidence of generalization across cohorts.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

*Yam Eitan,Moshe Eliasof,Yoav Gelberg,Fabrizio Frasca,Guy Bar-Shalom,Haggai Maron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOD-GNN enhances GNN expressivity by leveraging high-order derivatives of the base MPNN, processed by a second GNN, achieving WL-aligned expressivity with efficient derivative computation; connects to Subgraph GNNs and structural encodings, and shows strong benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN expressivity lags behind theoretical capabilities; derivatives of node features offer a natural, underexplored resource to augment expressive power and overcome oversmoothing/oversquashing limitations.

Method: Compute high-order derivatives of node features from a base MPNN to produce structure-aware embeddings, which are then processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Develop a sparse, parallelizable message-passing algorithm to compute high-order derivatives, establish theoretical expressivity alignment with the WL hierarchy, and relate the approach to Subgraph GNNs and common structural encodings.

Result: The architecture's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy; demonstrates strong performance on standard graph-learning benchmarks; maintains computational efficiency by exploiting graph sparsity and parallelism; reveals deep connections to Subgraph GNNs and structural encoding schemes.

Conclusion: HOD-GNN offers a principled, scalable route to boost GNN expressivity by exploiting derivatives, bridging theoretical expressivity results with practical performance, and unifying it with related expressive graph representation strategies.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

*Ahmed Hendawy,Henrik Metternich,Théo Vincent,Mahdi Kallel,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MINTO uses the minimum of the Target and Online networks to bootstrap Q-values, combining stability with faster learning. It reduces overestimation bias and acts as a simple plug-in for many RL algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between stable targets (slow-moving) and fast but unstable bootstrapping by leveraging a minimum-based target to stabilize learning while speeding it up.

Method: The target for bootstrapping is computed as the minimum of the online network's estimate and the target network's estimate, instead of using one of them alone. This MINimum target is used in standard Bellman backups and can be integrated into various value-based and actor-critic algorithms with minimal overhead.

Result: MINTO consistently yields faster and more stable value function learning across diverse benchmarks, reduces overestimation bias associated with online bootstrapping, and shows improvements across online/offline RL and discrete/continuous action spaces.

Conclusion: MINTO is a simple, effective, and broadly applicable plug-in update rule that improves stability and learning speed in value-based and actor-critic RL methods.

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-augmented, physically interpretable mass-conserving MCP models can match LSTM-based performance for CONUS-scale hydrology, illustrating the value of theory-informed, parsimonious architectures that encode mass conservation and varying process dominance across regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML-based large-sample hydrology has not consistently yielded gains in physical understanding; there is a need for physically grounded, interpretable models that adapt to regional process dominance and preserve mass balance across catchments.

Method: Deploy Mass-Conserving Perceptron (MCP)–based catchment-scale models of varying complexity, improved by ML components, and evaluate across CONUS with attribute masks for snow regime, forest cover, and climate zone; compare against LSTM benchmarks; analyze how model complexity should match the dominant hydrological processes.

Result: Physically interpretable MCP-based models achieved performance comparable to data-driven LSTM models; performance is improved when model complexity is matched to the prevailing hydrological regime, highlighting the value of process-aware architectures.

Conclusion: Supports a theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, favoring parsimonious, interpretable architectures that encode mass conservation and spatially/temporally varying process dominance, and enabling future models that generalize across diverse hydro-climatic conditions.

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

### [80] [MINERVA: Mutual Information Neural Estimation for Supervised Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02610)
*Taurai Muvunzaa,Egor Kraev,Pere Planell-Morell,Alexander Y. Shestopaloff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MINERVA is a neural mutual-information-based feature selection method with a two-stage learning process that decouples representation learning from selection, capable of capturing higher-order feature-target dependencies and showing strong results on synthetic and fraud datasets, including exact-solution capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard filter methods rely on pairwise dependencies and miss higher-order interactions between features and the target, limiting feature selection effectiveness for complex dependency structures.

Method: Approximate mutual information between features and targets using neural networks; optimize a loss function augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers; employ a two-stage pipeline separating representation learning from feature selection; evaluate feature subsets as an ensemble to capture complex relationships.

Result: The approach captures complex feature-target relationships (including higher-order interactions) more effectively, improves generalization, and demonstrates strong empirical performance on synthetic data and real-world fraud datasets, with claims of achieving exact solutions in some settings.

Conclusion: MINERVA provides a novel, MI-based feature selection framework that handles higher-order dependencies and improves generalization through a decoupled, two-stage design, validated by synthetic and fraud-data experiments.

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot tabular imputation with a pre-trained transformer (TabImpute) that is fast, accurate, and requires no fitting, outperforming 11 baselines on MissBench across 42 OpenML datasets and 13 missingness patterns, aided by a 100x speedup from entry-wise featurization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data is pervasive in tabular datasets; existing imputation methods vary widely in performance and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. There is no universally robust default imputation method for real-world domains.

Method: Extends TabPFN into TabImpute by (i) employing entry-wise featurization enabling ~100× speedups, (ii) creating a synthetic training pipeline with realistic missingness patterns, and (iii) evaluating on MissBench—a benchmark spanning 42 OpenML datasets and 13 missingness patterns across medicine, finance, and engineering.

Result: TabImpute demonstrates robust, competitive performance against 11 established imputation methods across MissBench, with substantial speedups and zero-shot applicability (no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at inference).

Conclusion: TabImpute provides an accurate, fast default imputation for tabular data, enabling zero-shot imputations without fitting and hyperparameter tuning at inference, and sets a new practical baseline evaluated on diverse real-world domains.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and
time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, no default imputation method exists.
Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,
showcasing TabImpute's robust performance compared to $11$ established
imputation methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperAdaLoRA speeds up AdaLoRA training for parameter-efficient fine-tuning by using a hypernetwork to generate SVD-based update components, enabling dynamic rank via pruning and resulting in faster convergence without sacrificing performance; shows broad applicability to other LoRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address slow convergence and high computational overhead of AdaLoRA caused by fixed-rank updates and per-step SVD, by learning update parameters through a hypernetwork to enable dynamic rank allocation.

Method: Replace direct optimization of SVD factors (P, Λ, Q) with an attention-based hypernetwork that generates these parameters; prune the hypernetwork outputs to determine singular-value-based rank; validate across datasets and models and extend to other LoRA-based approaches.

Result: Faster convergence without sacrificing performance; robust across multiple datasets/models; demonstrates broad applicability to other LoRA approaches.

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA provides a faster, more adaptable approach to PEFT with SVD-based updates, leveraging hypernetworks for rapid parameter generation and dynamic rank allocation.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizes drive-by sensing by tuning a 2-axle vehicle's tyre suspension to maximize damage-detection sensitivity, using AAE-based reconstruction and Kriging-based optimization; finds effective vehicle-bridge frequency ratios and advocates a purpose-built inspection vehicle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drive-by bridge health monitoring is promising but performance is constrained by vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the sensing platform could significantly improve damage sensitivity and reliability.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning with adversarial autoencoders (AAE) to reconstruct frequency-domain acceleration responses; optimization of tyre-suspension mass and stiffness via minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage-index distributions for healthy and damaged states; Kriging meta-model to efficiently approximate the objective and identify optimal configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional parameter spaces.

Result: Optimal vehicle frequency ratios relative to the bridge's first natural frequency lie between 0.3 and 0.7; resonance proximity yields poor detection; lighter vehicles require even lower natural frequencies for optimal sensing; the study provides the first formal optimization of the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and proposes a purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Conclusion: The work constitutes a foundational step in optimizing the sensing platform for drive-by health monitoring, showing that vehicle-structure interaction can be tuned to enhance damage sensitivity and guiding future design of inspection vehicles.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TutorBench provides a 1,490-sample, rubric-driven benchmark to evaluate LLM-based tutoring across adaptive explanations, feedback, and hint generation; results show current frontier models underperform with max ~56% and under 60% in key tutoring skills, highlighting room for improvement and Claude's relative strength in active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As students adopt LLMs for learning, there is a need for models that accurately diagnose student needs, adapt explanations, offer personalized guidance, and provide actionable feedback. The authors create TutorBench to rigorously evaluate these core tutoring skills.

Method: Introduce TutorBench dataset; 1,490 samples, high-school/AP-level; three tasks; sample-specific rubrics; LLM-judge automatic evaluation; evaluate 16 frontier LLMs; analyze strengths/weaknesses by model family.

Result: No frontier model scores above 56%; all less than 60% pass rate on tutoring-skill rubrics; Claude excels at active learning but lags in other tasks; reveals substantial room for improvement in tutoring capabilities.

Conclusion: TutorBench offers a comprehensive, unsaturated benchmark to drive development of next-gen AI tutors; future work likely to improve across adaptive explanations, feedback, and hint generation.

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

### [85] [Topological Invariance and Breakdown in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02670)
*Yongyi Yang,Tomaso Poggio,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training with a broad class of permutation-equivariant rules induces a bi-Lipschitz neuron mapping and topological constraints on neuron distributions; a topological critical learning rate eta* separates a topology-preserving (low eta) from a topology-simplifying (high eta) regime, implying a two-phase learning process influenced by edge-of-stability, with universality across architectures and losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how optimization dynamics and permutation-equivariant learning rules constrain neuron topology and expressivity, and to connect these constraints to recent edge-of-stability phenomena.

Method: Theoretical analysis showing that gradient-based training induces a bi-Lipschitz mapping between neurons, with topology of the neuron manifold constrained during training. Identification of a topological critical point eta* separating topology-preserving and topology-simplifying regimes. Demonstration that the results hold across architectures and losses, emphasizing a universal topological framework for deep learning.

Result: For learning rates below eta*, training preserves all topological structure of the neuron distribution; for rates above eta*, the neuron manifold courses through topological simplifications, reducing expressivity. The dynamics can be viewed as two phases: smooth optimization under topological constraints, followed by drastic topological simplifications. The theory does not depend on specific architectures or loss functions, enabling universal application of topological methods.

Conclusion: The work provides a universal, architecture- and loss-agnostic topological lens on deep learning, predicting a two-phase training dynamic tied to a topological critical point and aligning with the edge-of-stability phenomenon; this suggests topological methods as broadly applicable tools for understanding and guiding modern neural nets.

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

*Zeyu Yang,Tianyi Zhang,Jianwen Xie,Chuan Li,Zhaozhuo Xu,Anshumali Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exponents in GenAI weights show low-entropy concentration across models and modalities, enabling a near-FP4.67 compression limit. The paper proposes Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless, entropy-aware FP8 framework with GPU-optimized decoding, achieving up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput gains on models up to 671B parameters, with no change in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GenAI models scale to hundreds of billions of parameters, efficient low-precision formats are crucial. The authors identify exponent concentration as a universal, statistically grounded property, motivating a lossless FP8 design that avoids dequantization overhead and preserves numerical stability.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical and empirical study of exponent entropy under alpha-stable distributions induced by SGD, deriving tight entropy bounds for exponents and establishing a compression limit near FP4.67. They design Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8) with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding, and validate on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters.

Result: ECF8 achieves up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration with perfectly lossless computations (no deviation in model outputs) across evaluated models.

Conclusion: Exponent concentration appears to be a statistical law of trained GenAI models, enabling a principled path to lossless, low-precision FP design in the FP8 era and motivating practical FP8 formats like ECF8.

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Motivation: To deepen understanding of neural operator learning, provide explanations of prediction processes, and improve generalization by incorporating physical principles.

Method: Classify neural operators into two types; propose explanations for prediction, demonstrate hidden physical pattern learning, introduce a simple dual-space multi-scale model achieving SOTA, and discuss need for physics-informed frameworks.

Result: Neural operators can learn hidden physical patterns; existing explanations work only in limited cases; a dual-space multi-scale model achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows strong potential; dual-space models merit further study.

Conclusion: A generalizable explanation method is still needed; principled physics-incorporation into neural operators is crucial for better generalization and uncovering more physical phenomena.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

*Meng Xu,Jiao Liu,Yew Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoSpeak merges genetic programming with large language models to warm-start, explain, and transfer GP heuristics, boosting efficiency and interpretability in dynamic scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address interpretability, convergence speed, and cross-task transferability of complex GP heuristics in dynamic, large-scale optimization.

Method: A hybrid framework: learn from high-quality GP heuristics; extract transferable knowledge; use LLMs to generate warm-start populations, translate GP trees into natural-language explanations, and enable knowledge transfer across related tasks; evaluate on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling with single and multi-objective variants.

Result: EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, accelerates evolution, and yields human-readable reports, improving usability and trust.

Conclusion: Integrating GP with LLMs yields transparent, adaptable, and task-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization.

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

### [89] [Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models via Intermediate Distribution Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02692)
*Gautham Govind Anil,Shaan Ul Haque,Nithish Kannen,Dheeraj Nagaraj,Sanjay Shakkottai,Karthikeyan Shanmugam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes shaping diffusion-model outputs with reward-based objectives, showing that RAFT variants can be viewed as PPO-like GRAFT; introduces P-GRAFT to modulate intermediate-noise levels; proposes inverse noise correction to improve flow models without explicit rewards; reports improvements across text-to-image, layout, molecule, and unconditional image generation, notably boosting Stable Diffusion 2 metrics and reducing FLOPs for better FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models capture training data distributions but may need alignment with downstream tasks. Direct reward-based training is challenging due to intractable marginal likelihoods; there is a need for practical methods that integrate reward shaping with diffusion training to improve task-specific performance.

Method: Unify RAFT variants as GRAFT and show they implicitly perform PPO with reshaped rewards; propose P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels; introduce inverse noise correction to improve flow models without explicit rewards; conduct extensive experiments across text-to-image generation, layout generation, molecule generation, and unconditional image generation, applying methods to Stable Diffusion 2.

Result: Demonstrates that RAFT/GRAFT approximates PPO with reshaped rewards; P-GRAFT yields more effective fine-tuning via intermediate-noise shaping; explains bias-variance tradeoffs motivating the approach; inverse noise correction improves flow models absent explicit rewards; in T2I benchmarks on Stable Diffusion 2, achieves notable improvements in VQAScore relative to the base model; reports an 8.81% relative improvement; for unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction yields better FID at lower FLOPs per image.

Conclusion: A unified view of RAFT variants as GRAFT recasts diffusion fine-tuning as a PPO-like process with reward shaping; P-GRAFT and inverse noise correction offer improved performance and efficiency across diverse generation tasks, supported by empirical results and a bias-variance explanation.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

### [90] [RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695)
*Kai Fukazawa,Kunal Mundada,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAMAC is a risk-aware offline RL framework that pairs an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic to optimize a risk-sensitive, multimodal objective, yielding improved tail risk (CVaR@0.1) while maintaining strong returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In safety-critical offline RL, we need high returns with low lower-tail risk. Prior risk-averse methods are conservative and restrict policy expressiveness, leaving a gap for rich, multimodal policies.

Method: RAMAC introduces an expressive generative actor coupled with a distributional critic. It differentiates a composite objective that combines distributional risk with a behavior cloning loss via the generative path, enabling risk-sensitive learning in multimodal settings. The framework is instantiated with diffusion and flow-matching actors.

Result: Empirically, RAMAC achieves consistent gains in CVaR@0.1 while maintaining strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks; code is provided. 

Conclusion: RAMAC enables risk-sensitive learning with expressive multimodal policies in offline RL, addressing the gap between risk-averse conservatism and policy expressiveness; the approach yields better tail-risk performance without sacrificing overall returns.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight Temporal-Spatial Transformer IDS (TSLT-Net) for drone networks achieving near-perfect multiclass and binary intrusion detection with minimal resources on ISOT drone data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drones face growing cybersecurity threats and current intrusion detection systems struggle with adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability in dynamic, resource-constrained drone environments. There is a need for a lightweight, unified model that can capture both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic to enable real-time defense.

Method: Introduce TSLT-Net, a unified Temporal Spatial Transformer-based intrusion detection architecture. It uses self-attention to model temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline, and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single model. Designed for edge deployment and evaluated on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset (≈2.3M labeled records).

Result: TSLT-Net achieves 99.99% accuracy in multiclass intrusion detection and 100% accuracy in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a tiny footprint (0.04 MB memory, 9722 trainable parameters). This indicates strong performance with low resource requirements, suitable for real-time edge deployment in mission-critical UAV systems.

Conclusion: TSLT-Net is presented as an effective and scalable solution for real-time drone cybersecurity, offering high accuracy with minimal resource use and applicability to edge devices. While promising, validation on additional datasets and scenarios would help establish generalizability across diverse drone networks.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Conclusion: CST AFNet is a powerful and scalable solution for real-time cyber threat detection in complex IoT/IIoT environments, enhancing security for cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized modern
industries by enabling smart automation and real time connectivity. However,
this evolution has also introduced complex cybersecurity challenges due to the
heterogeneous, resource constrained, and distributed nature of these
environments. To address these challenges, this research presents CST AFNet, a
novel dual attention based deep learning framework specifically designed for
robust intrusion detection in IoT networks. The model integrates multi scale
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex

*Nicholas Lourie,He He,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an asymptotic theory for hyperparameter loss surfaces and a random-search–based method to infer their structure, enabling confidence intervals and estimation of effective hyperparameters, with a code release at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameters greatly influence model capabilities, but exhaustive search is infeasible for modern large models. Understanding the loss surface and its asymptotic regime can guide cross-scale design and enable extrapolation and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Develop a theory that reveals a simple structure as one approaches the optimum. Introduce a novel random-search technique to uncover the asymptotic regime. Show the best random-search scores follow a new distribution whose parameters are the surface’s defining features. Derive an asymptotic law for random search and link it to empirical convergence.

Result: A new set of tools: (1) confidence intervals for the best possible performance, (2) a method to infer the effective number of hyperparameters, and (3) an asymptotic law for random search that explains convergence. Code and tools are released at https://github.com/nicholaslourie/opda.

Conclusion: These tools enable new analyses of hyperparameter landscapes, including extrapolating random-search behavior and assessing the fundamental limits of tuning across scales.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

*Yuxuan Wang,Haixu Wu,Yuezhou Ma,Yuchen Fang,Ziyi Zhang,Yong Liu,Shiyu Wang,Zhou Ye,Yang Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an "accuracy law" for deep time series forecasting: the minimum achievable forecasting error scales exponentially with the complexity of window-wise patterns; validated on 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters; used to identify saturated benchmarks and guide training for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting inherently has a non-zero error lower bound due to partial observability and uncertainty. Unlike image recognition, pursuing 100% accuracy is unrealistic, so it is valuable to estimate an upper bound on performance to guide research focus and benchmark design.

Method: Train and evaluate over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters. Analyze window-wise properties in the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm. Establish and validate an exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error and window-wise pattern complexity. Formulate the accuracy law and demonstrate its utility for identifying saturated tasks and for devising effective training strategies for large time series models.

Result: The proposed accuracy law successfully identifies saturated tasks on widely used benchmarks and yields an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering a principled direction for future research.

Conclusion: By recognizing a fundamental upper bound on forecasting accuracy linked to window-wise pattern complexity, the work reframes objectives in deep time series forecasting, helps avoid saturated benchmarks, and informs dataset/model design and training protocols for future studies.

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

*Nishanth Shetty,Madhava Prasath,Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Biologically grounded multiplicative updates from geometric Brownian motion yield log-normal weights and new multiplicative denoising score-matching, enabling score-based generative modeling on non-negative data; validated on MNIST-like datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge gap between standard gradient descent and biological learning by enforcing Dale's law; derive multiplicative updates that yield log-normal weight distributions; extend score-based modeling to non-negative data via multiplicative denoising score-matching.

Method: Model starts from the SDE of geometric Brownian motion; discretizes the reverse-time SDE to obtain a multiplicative update; connects this to exponential gradient descent under Dale's law; introduces a new multiplicative denoising score-matching formalism that subsumes Hyvärinen's loss for non-negative data; trains score-based models on image data and generates samples starting from a log-normal density.

Result: Derivation shows the reverse-time GBM discretization produces multiplicative updates matching the sampling-based exponential gradient; introduces a multiplicative score-matching scheme; demonstrates generative capability on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Kuzushiji; claims this is the first biologically inspired generative model with GBM-based multiplicative updates.

Conclusion: Biological constraints can inspire multiplicative learning rules leading to log-normal weight distributions; multiplicative score matching extends score-based generation to non-negative data; results suggest a viable biologically plausible alternative for generative modeling.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

*Tianxiang Zhao,Youqing Wang,Jinlu Wang,Jiapu Wang,Mingliang Cui,Junbin Gao,Jipeng Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC) using hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA) to jointly augment node- and edge-level embeddings and adaptively weight contrastive pairs, improving clustering accuracy on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CAGC methods mainly rely on node-level augmentation and treat all contrastive pairs equally, neglecting edge-level information and the interactions between node- and edge-level augmentations across granularities, which limits discriminability.

Method: Introduce a framework that simultaneously performs node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations to establish a unified similarity criterion for contrastive learning. Use discriminative similarity to guide edge augmentation. Employ CSADA, using high-confidence pseudo-labels to identify all contrastive sample pairs and apply a weight modulation function to differentiate treatment of hard vs easy positives/negatives. The HCA and CSADA modules reinforce each other in a loop to boost discriminability.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show RAGC outperforms several state-of-the-art CAGC methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving clustering quality.

Conclusion: RAGC effectively enhances discriminability in attributed graph clustering by jointly leveraging node- and edge-level augmentations and adaptive weighting of contrastive pairs, validated through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

*Junyi Chen,Chuheng Du,Renyuan Liu,Shuochao Yao,Dingtian Yan,Jiang Liao,Shengzhong Liu,Fan Wu,Guihai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenFlow is a preemptive, cache-aware streaming LLM serving system that improves responsiveness and throughput in real-time token streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time LLM interactions require fast, steadily generated text; current non-preemptive scheduling and reactive memory management cause underutilization and limited parallelism during bursts, hurting user experience.

Method: TokenFlow introduces preemptive request scheduling guided by real-time token buffer occupancy and consumption rate, plus proactive KV cache management that transfers data between GPU and CPU in the background and overlaps I/O with computation to reduce preemption overhead.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200) shows up to 82.5% higher effective throughput (considering actual user consumption) and up to 80.2% reduction in P99 TTFT, without sacrificing overall token throughput.

Conclusion: Preemptive scheduling combined with proactive KV caching substantially improves streaming performance for real-time LLM interactions, enhancing responsiveness and resource efficiency under bursty workloads.

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome label scarcity in HAB monitoring and enable scalable, global mapping by integrating diverse satellite data with self-supervised learning.

Method: Fuse reflectance from VIIRS, MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE with TROPOMI SIF; apply self-supervised representation learning and hierarchical deep clustering to produce interpretable HAB severity/speciation classes.

Result: Demonstrates strong agreement with total phytoplankton and key HAB taxa (Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., Pseudo-nitzschia spp) across Gulf of Mexico and Southern California (2018–2025), enabling label-free HAB mapping and exploratory hierarchical embeddings.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable approach to operationalize self-supervised learning for global aquatic biogeochemistry and HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised machine learning framework for detecting and
mapping harmful algal bloom (HAB) severity and speciation using multi-sensor
satellite data. By fusing reflectance data from operational instruments (VIIRS,
MODIS, Sentinel-3, PACE) with TROPOMI solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), our
framework, called SIT-FUSE, generates HAB severity and speciation products
without requiring per-instrument labeled datasets. The framework employs
self-supervised representation learning, hierarchical deep clustering to
segment phytoplankton concentrations and speciations into interpretable
classes, validated against in-situ data from the Gulf of Mexico and Southern
California (2018-2025). Results show strong agreement with total phytoplankton,
Karenia brevis, Alexandrium spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements. This
work advances scalable HAB monitoring in label-scarce environments while
enabling exploratory analysis via hierarchical embeddings: a critical step
toward operationalizing self-supervised learning for global aquatic
biogeochemistry.

*Hugo Ninou,Jonathan Kadmon,N. Alex Cayco-Gajic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-gradient curl-like terms can coexist with gradient-based learning; in some networks they stabilize and perform similarly to gradient descent, in others they destabilize or even speed learning by escaping saddles; architecture dictates outcomes; suggests robust learning with diverse rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether biological learning may rely on non-gradient dynamics and how such curl terms affect learning performance and stability.

Method: Analytical study of a student-teacher feedforward network, introducing non-gradient dynamics via rule-flipped plasticity; examine stability of solution manifolds under varying curl strength; identify critical thresholds and architectural dependencies.

Result: Small curl terms preserve gradient-like behavior; beyond a critical curl strength, stability losses occur, potentially causing chaotic learning; in some settings curl terms can speed up learning by escaping saddles.

Conclusion: Diverse learning rules can support robust learning beyond strict gradient descent; curl dynamics challenge normative gradient-based theories; architecture plays key role in whether non-gradient terms aid or hinder learning.

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

### [100] [A Granular Study of Safety Pretraining under Model Abliteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02768)
*Shashank Agnihotri,Jonas Jakubassa,Priyam Dey,Sachin Goyal,Bernt Schiele,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Abliteration is evaluated on SmolLM2-1.7B safety checkpoints to see whether common safety interventions survive inference-time edits. Across 20 systems, original vs abliterated, 100 prompts (harmful/harmless) are judged as Refusal or Non-Refusal by multiple judges; judge fidelity checked on a labeled subset; model-self-refusal detection is explored; results highlight robustness of data-centric safety components, the influence of judge selection on evaluation, and a practical protocol for safety assessment with inference-time edits. Code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-weight LLMs enable inference-time edits that could undermine safety interventions (e.g., refusal or metatag training). The study investigates how such edits affect safety behavior, aiming to quantify robustness, evaluator bias, and to provide a practical evaluation protocol.

Method: Apply a lightweight projection called model abliteration to remove refusal-sensitive directions across 20 Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B. For each system (original and abliterated), issue 100 prompts (balanced harmful/harmless). Classify outputs as Refusal or Non-Refusal by multiple judges; validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. Probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Analyze checkpoint-level robustness of data-centric safety components, quantify the impact of judge selection on outcomes, and outline a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code: https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/safety_pretraining

Result: The study provides checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components stay robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for safety assessments that incorporate inference-time edits.

Conclusion: Abliteration is a practical, lightweight technique to test the persistence of safety interventions under inference-time edits. Evaluations must account for potential judge bias and component robustness; the work offers actionable protocol guidance and open-source code for practitioners.

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

### [101] [Optimal Rates for Generalization of Gradient Descent for Deep ReLU Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02779)
*Yuanfan Li,Yunwen Lei,Zheng-Chu Guo,Yiming Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GD with deep ReLU nets can attain near-minimax generalization rates similar to kernel methods; achieves rate approximately tilde O( L^4 (1 + γ L^2) / (n γ^2) ), i.e., polynomial in depth and matching O(1/(n γ^2)) up to depth factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge between gradient-descent generalization of deep nets and kernel minimax rates; address suboptimal rates and depth-exponential dependence in prior work.

Method: Analyze gradient descent dynamics under NTK separability assumption; derive excess risk bound by balancing optimization and generalization errors; introduce activation-pattern control near a reference model to sharpen Rademacher complexity bounds.

Result: Excess risk bound tilde O( L^4 (1+ γ L^2) /( n γ^2) ), aligning with SVM-type rate up to depth factors; demonstrates polynomial depth dependence.

Conclusion: Provides optimal rates for GD with deep ReLU networks and new technique for activation-pattern control; strengthens connection between GD in deep nets and kernel regimes.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

### [103] [Relevance-Aware Thresholding in Online Conformal Prediction for Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02809)
*Théo Dupuy,Binbin Xu,Stéphane Perrey,Jacky Montmain,Abdelhak Imoussaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a relevance-based update mechanism for Online Conformal Prediction thresholds in time series to yield tighter intervals while preserving coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCP threshold updates optimize only validity (coverage) and ignore how relevant or informative the interval is, leading to abrupt changes and potentially wider intervals under distribution shifts.

Method: Replace the binary in/out evaluation with a flexible class of relevance functions that quantify the interval's relevance using the ground truth, shaping the threshold update to be smoother and more informative while maintaining long-run coverage guarantees.

Result: Empirical results on real-world datasets show tighter prediction intervals with maintained coverage compared to existing OCP methods.

Conclusion: Relevance-based threshold updates improve the informativeness of OCP intervals without compromising validity, offering a practical enhancement for time-series uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

### [104] [Dissecting Transformers: A CLEAR Perspective towards Green AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02810)
*Hemang Jain,Shailender Goyal,Divyansh Pandey,Karthik Vaidhyanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CLEAR, a fine-grained, component-level energy measurement method for LLM inference, showing attention blocks burn more energy per FLOP and energy cost is not well aligned with FLOPs; provides baselines across 15 models and 4 architectures to enable energy-efficient transformer design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference dominates AI energy consumption; existing sustainability studies rely on coarse, model-level metrics and ignore fine-grained component costs; need granular measurement to guide component-level optimizations.

Method: Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR) to synchronize microsecond-scale component execution with millisecond-scale energy sensors; evaluate 15 models across four architecture types; ensure low component-energy variance (<9.5%) and capture >90% of total energy at the component level.

Result: Found that attention blocks consume significantly more energy per FLOP, indicating energy cost does not scale with FLOPs; established detailed component-level energy baselines and demonstrated the feasibility of capturing most of the energy in individual components across diverse models.

Conclusion: FINE-GRAINED component-level energy baselines enable targeted optimizations to build energy-efficient transformers; FLOPs alone are insufficient to estimate energy cost at the component level; results motivate architecture-level and component-level optimizations to reduce energy consumption.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

### [105] [Mitigating Spurious Correlation via Distributionally Robust Learning with Hierarchical Ambiguity Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02818)
*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical extension of Group DRO to handle inter- and intra-group distribution shifts, with new minority-shift benchmarks, achieving robustness and strong standard performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning often fails under distribution shifts due to spurious correlations; while Group DRO guards against shifts across predefined groups, it remains vulnerable to intra-group (within-group) distributional shifts, especially in minority groups with few samples.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical extension of Group DRO that models uncertainty at multiple levels (inter-group and intra-group) via expanded ambiguity sets; propose benchmark settings that simulate minority-group distribution shifts; evaluate robustness and standard accuracy.

Result: Empirically, the method achieves strong robustness under minority distribution shifts where existing robust methods fail, and also attains superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Broadening the ambiguity set to capture multi-level distributional uncertainties improves robustness to distribution shifts; this work emphasizes addressing intra-group shifts and advances spurious-correlation research.

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

*Martino Bernasconi,Andrea Celli,Riccardo Colini-Baldeschi,Federico Fusco,Stefano Leonardi,Matteo Russo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A template to adapt stochastic online-learning algorithms to the random-order model, preserving regret and yielding improved bounds across several tasks; in random order, online classification learnability is governed by VC dimension, not Littlestone, revealing a separation from adversarial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile stochastic learners with the random-order online-learning model, where finite-time non-stationarity can degrade performance despite asymptotic i.i.d.-like behavior, and to understand learnability in online classification under random order.

Method: Introduce a general adaptation template that transforms stochastic-learning algorithms to work in the random-order setting without sacrificing regret guarantees. Apply this template to (i) prediction with delays, (ii) online learning with constraints, (iii) bandits with switching costs, and (iv) online classification, analyzing learnability under random order (VC vs Littlestone).

Result: The adaptation preserves regret guarantees while improving bounds in several settings (delays, constrained online learning, switching-cost bandits). In online classification, learnability under random order is characterized by VC dimension rather than Littlestone dimension, indicating a fundamental separation from the general adversarial model.

Conclusion: A simple, general template effectively tames the random-order model, retaining stochastic regret guarantees and revealing a key dimension-theoretic boundary: VC dimension governs online-classification learnability under random order, distinct from Littlestone and adversarial settings.

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

### [107] [FlexiQ: Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization for Latency/Accuracy Trade-Offs in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02822)
*Jaemin Kim,Hongjun Um,Sungkyun Kim,Yongjun Park,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexiQ is an adaptive mixed-precision quantization framework that selectively quantizes channels by value-range, uses an efficient bit-lowering method to reduce quantization error, and dynamically adjusts the low-bitwidth channel ratio to handle real-time workload fluctuations, achieving better accuracy and latency trade-offs with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware accelerators (NPUs/GPUs) are costly, and real-time workload fluctuations make static quantization inefficient. A dynamic, per-channel mixed-precision approach can save resources while maintaining accuracy and throughput.

Method: Apply low-bitwidth computation selectively to feature channels with small value ranges; introduce an efficient bit-lowering technique to minimize quantization errors; dynamically adjust the proportion of channels quantized to low-bitwidth in real time; implement a mixed-precision runtime on a custom NPU and GPUs; evaluate on eleven convolution- and transformer-based vision models.

Result: Average 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning; outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization methods; 50% 4-bit model incurs only 0.6% accuracy loss while delivering 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model when compared to the 8-bit baseline; latency overhead is minimal on both NPU and GPUs, confirming hardware efficiency and performance gains.

Conclusion: FlexiQ enables more accurate and hardware-efficient mixed-precision inference under fluctuating workloads by adaptively allocating low-bitwidth channels with low overhead, yielding favorable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

*Makram Chahine,Philipp Nazari,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-training Hankel-based model order reduction for State Space Models—start large, shrink during training to smaller, efficient models while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle long sequence modeling with SSMs by balancing expressivity and computational cost; standard SSMs' update costs scale with state dimension; need principled dimensionality reduction with performance guarantees.

Method: Use Hankel singular value analysis to measure state energy and perform balanced truncation to a smaller representation during training; apply to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs (Linear Recurrent Units) and extendable to selective models; identify high-influence state dimensions and preserve them while discarding low-energy modes during training.

Result: In-training reduction accelerates optimization and preserves expressivity; compressed models retain task-critical structure lost when training directly at small dimension.

Conclusion: A large-to-small training strategy for SSMs yields computational efficiency without sacrificing performance; shrinking during training maintains performance while reducing runtime costs.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

*Steve Hong,Samuel Belkadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframe Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models as an iterative, diffusion-like refinement process that builds a latent pyramid and reconstructs it in few coarse-to-fine steps; identifies three design choices that drive efficiency and fidelity; validates via controlled experiments and highlights extensions to graphs and probabilistic weather forecasting, with diffusion-tool integration while keeping few-step, scale-parallel generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect VAR with modern denoising diffusion methods, understand what drives fidelity and speed, and broaden VAR’s applicability to other domains (graphs, weather) while enabling practical diffusion-like interfaces.

Method: Propose a deterministic forward process that constructs a Laplacian-like latent pyramid and a learned backward process that reconstructs it through a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. Cast prediction as discrete classification over learned code indices. Partition the task by spatial frequency. Conduct controlled experiments to quantify each factor’s impact on fidelity and speed. Discuss extensions to permutation-invariant graph generation and probabilistic, ensemble-style weather forecasting. Propose interfaces for VAR to leverage diffusion tools while retaining few-step generation.

Result: Isolate three contributing factors to performance: refining in a learned latent space, discrete code-index classification, and spatial-frequency partitioning. Demonstrate that these choices explain efficiency and fidelity gains; show the framework generalizes to graphs and weather forecasting and can leverage diffusion ecosystems for practical tools.

Conclusion: A unified framework that links VAR with diffusion approaches, enabling efficient, few-step generation and broad applicability, while preserving the benefits of scale-parallel generation and offering practical diffusion-based interfaces for VAR.

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

### [110] [Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear Models for Interpretable Personalized Health Prediction from Multimodal Lifelog Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02835)
*Dohyun Bu,Jisoo Han,Soohwa Kwon,Yulim So,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable, subject-adaptive sparse linear framework (SASL) for personalized health prediction that matches black-box models with far fewer parameters, using OLS with subject interactions, backward feature elimination, regression-then-thresholding for ordinal targets, and LightGBM gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to predict personalized health outcomes from multimodal lifelog data with models that are both accurate and interpretable. State-of-the-art deep nets and gradient-boosted ensembles struggle with interpretability and fail to capture strong inter-individual variability in lifelog signals.

Method: SASL couples ordinary least squares regression with subject-specific interactions to separate global vs. individual effects. It uses iterative backward feature elimination via nested F-tests to produce a sparse, robust model. For ordinal outcomes, it applies regression-then-thresholding to optimize macro-F1. When predictions are challenging, it selectively gates outputs from compact LightGBM models based on confidence to boost accuracy without sacrificing interpretability.

Result: On the CH-2025 dataset (≈450 daily observations from 10 subjects), the SASL-LightGBM hybrid achieves predictive performance comparable to sophisticated black-box methods while using significantly fewer parameters and offering greater transparency, enabling actionable clinical insights.

Conclusion: The SASL framework provides an interpretable, personalized prediction approach that balances accuracy and interpretability. Its hybrid integration with LightGBM demonstrates that competitive performance can be achieved without sacrificing transparency, making it attractive for clinical and practical deployment.

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

*Vijay Babu Pamshetti,Wei Zhang,Sumei Sun,Jie Zhang,Yonggang Wen,Qingyu Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Karma is a knowledge-guided, frequency-aware dual-stream model for battery health prognostics that combines signal decomposition with a physics-informed degradation function and particle-filter-based uncertainty quantification, achieving substantial error reductions over state-of-the-art on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven battery prognostics struggle with nonlinear degradation, noise, and capacity regeneration when predictions must be reliable long-term. Integrating domain knowledge with learning and adaptive frequency analysis aims to improve robustness, physical consistency, and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Decompose battery signals into multiple frequency bands. Use a dual-stream deep learning architecture: one stream captures long-term low-frequency degradation, the other models short-term high-frequency dynamics. Model degradation with a double exponential function guided by empirical knowledge. Optimize knowledge parameters with particle filters to ensure physical consistency and quantify uncertainty.

Result: Experiments show Karma reduces prognostic errors by 50.6% and 32.6% compared with state-of-the-art on two mainstream datasets, indicating robustness and generalizability.

Conclusion: Karma offers a robust, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware framework for battery health prognosis, integrating knowledge-guided modeling with frequency-adaptive learning to enhance safety and reliability in battery management.

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Motivation: The field relies on RL with ground-truth rewards to improve reasoning in LLMs, but ground-truth rewards are costly or unavailable. Test-Time RL (TTRL) mitigates this by using majority-vote rewards yet still requires heavy online RL and incurs high computation. There is a need for a lightweight, offline alternative that matches regularized optimal policies.

Method: RoiRL proposes offline iterative reinforcement learning that optimizes weighted log-likelihood objectives rather than maintaining and updating a reference model. This eliminates the need for online interactions and enables stable training with lower memory and compute. It targets the same regularized optimal policies as online methods.

Result: Empirical results show RoiRL trains 2.5x faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: RoiRL provides a scalable, label-free pathway to self-improving LLMs by removing the dependence on online RL and reference models, achieving faster training with better or comparable reasoning performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

### [113] [DMark: Order-Agnostic Watermarking for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02902)
*Linyu Wu,Linhao Zhong,Wenjie Qu,Yuexin Li,Yue Liu,Shengfang Zhai,Chunhua Shen,Jiaheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark is the first watermarking framework tailored for diffusion-based language models, achieving high detection rates (92.0–99.5% at 1% FPR) while preserving text quality, and outperforming naive adaptations of autoregressive watermarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Watermarking methods designed for autoregressive LMs fail on diffusion-based LLMs because diffusion decoding is non-sequential; tokens can be finalized in arbitrary orders, breaking causal watermark designs. There is a need for watermarking approaches that align with diffusion decoding to enable reliable detection and robustness.

Method: Introduce three complementary strategies: (1) predictive watermarking uses model-predicted tokens when actual context is unavailable; (2) bidirectional watermarking leverages forward and backward dependencies inherent to diffusion decoding; (3) predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both to maximize detection strength. Evaluations span multiple diffusion-based LLMs.

Result: DMark achieves detection rates of 92.0–99.5% at 1% false positive rate, with maintained text quality. It is robust to text manipulations and substantially outperforms naive adaptations of existing watermarking methods (49.6–71.2% detection at 1% FPR).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models and provides a practical, robust framework for watermarking diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

*Tharuka Kasthuri Arachchige,Veselka Boeva,Shahrooz Abghari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FeDABoost introduces AdaBoost-inspired, dynamic client weighting and focal-loss-based boosting in Federated Learning to improve fairness under non-IID data, achieving competitive accuracy on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR-10 compared with FedAvg and Ditto.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-IID data in Federated Learning causes fairness and performance gaps across clients. There is a need for both smarter aggregation and targeted local training to help underperforming clients contribute more effectively to the global model.

Method: FeDABoost combines a dynamic boosting mechanism (adjusting local training emphasis via the focal loss parameter) with an adaptive gradient aggregation strategy that assigns higher weights to clients with lower local error rates (inspired by Multiclass AdaBoost SAMME). The framework is evaluated on MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR-10 and compared against FedAvg and Ditto.

Result: The approach yields improved fairness and competitive performance relative to the baselines on the three benchmarks.

Conclusion: FeDABoost demonstrates that integrating AdaBoost-inspired client weighting with focal-loss-based boosting can effectively enhance fairness in non-IID FL, achieving a balance between improved equitable contributions and strong overall performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end Cell-MNN learns a locally linear ODE in latent space to model cellular differentiation, enabling scalable, interpretable gene interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling cellular differentiation with the surge of single-cell data requires scalable, interpretable models that reveal explicit gene interactions and avoid expensive preprocessing.

Method: An encoder-decoder architecture where the latent dynamics are a locally linearized ODE; end-to-end training (besides PCA preprocessing); the model learns biologically meaningful gene interactions; evaluated on single-cell benchmarks and across multiple datasets with joint training; interactome validation against TRRUST.

Result: Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, scales better to larger datasets, enables joint training across multiple datasets, and learns interpretable gene interactions validated against the TRRUST database.

Conclusion: Cell-MNN provides a scalable, interpretable mechanistic framework for cellular differentiation, offering competitive performance while exposing explicit gene interactions that align with known databases.

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

*Juan Sebastian Rojas,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents risk-aware continual RL using ergodic risk measures; shows classical risk measures are incompatible with continual learning and validates the approach with an empirical case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend continual reinforcement learning beyond risk-neutral objectives by optimizing long-run reward-based measures of performance, and address the incompatibility of classical risk-measure theory with the continual setting.

Method: Formalize risk-aware continual RL, demonstrate incompatibility of existing risk measures, introduce a new class of ergodic risk measures compatible with continual learning, and provide a case study with empirical evaluation.

Result: Theoretical finding: classical risk measures do not fit continual RL; proposal of ergodic risk measures for continual learning; empirical case study supporting the appeal and soundness of the proposed measures.

Conclusion: Ergodic risk measures offer a compatible and promising framework for risk-aware continual RL, enabling robust lifelong adaptation.

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

*Aydin Javadov,Samir Garibov,Tobias Hoesli,Qiyang Sun,Florian von Wangenheim,Joseph Ollier,Björn W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A retrieval-informed, stochastic sparse sampling framework for variable-length medical time series that weights per-window predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregates them in probability space to produce convex, explainable series-level scores; shows competitive iEEG performance across centers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical time series are sparse, noisy, and highly variable in length; existing stochastic sampling or retrieval-based methods alone improve robustness but lack integrated explainability; there is a need for a transparent, retrieval-informed classifier for variable-length signals.

Method: Extend stochastic sparse sampling to retrieval-informed classification by weighting window-level predictions with within-channel similarity and aggregating them into probability-space scores, yielding an explicit evidence trail for explainability.

Result: Competitive iEEG classification across four medical centers, with improved transparency and potential for reliable, explainable clinical time series analysis.

Conclusion: The approach delivers explainable, convex series-level scores with an explicit evidence trail while maintaining strong performance, supporting retrieval-informed classification for variable-length medical time series in clinical practice.

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

*Akriti Sharma,Dogan Altan,Dusica Marijan,Arnbjørn Maressa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transfer learning improves shaft power prediction for ships by pretraining on high-frequency data and fine-tuning on low-frequency noon reports, achieving notable error reductions across sister, similar, and different vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce fuel costs and improve vessel performance through accurate shaft-power prediction, while addressing the scarcity and cost of high-quality sensor data by leveraging readily available noon reports as an alternative data source.

Method: Pretrain a model on high-frequency vessel data; fine-tune on low-frequency daily noon reports from other vessels; evaluate on sister vessels, a similar vessel, and a different vessel to assess generalization.

Result: MAPE reductions of 10.6% (sister vessels), 3.6% (similar vessel), and 5.3% (different vessel) compared with a model trained only on noon report data.

Conclusion: Transfer learning across vessels can enhance shaft-power prediction while reducing reliance on high-frequency data, suggesting a data-efficient pathway for energy optimization in shipping; broader validation and exploration of data sources could strengthen claims.

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end IB-based graph neural network BrainIB++ identifies informative brain-region subgraphs from rs-fMRI to diagnose schizophrenia, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability across multi-cohort datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliance on manual feature engineering in ML for brain imaging; bridge interpretability gap in deep learning to produce actionable brain biomarkers for psychiatric diagnosis.

Method: Proposes BrainIB++, an end-to-end graph neural network that uses the information bottleneck principle to extract the most informative subgraphs/regions during training; evaluates against nine baseline methods on three schizophrenia datasets; links subgraphs to known clinical biomarkers.

Result: Outperforms nine baseline brain-network classifiers; generalizes to unseen data; subgraphs align with visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition networks, supporting interpretability.

Conclusion: BrainIB++ offers a scalable, interpretable diagnostic framework that couples IB with GNNs to yield data-driven, clinically relevant brain biomarkers for schizophrenia, with potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

*Santanu Subhash Rathod,Francesco Ceccarelli,Sean B. Holden,Pietro Liò,Xiao Zhang,Jovan Tanevski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A context-aware flow matching framework (ContextFlow) improves trajectory inference from spatially resolved omics data by integrating local tissue organization and ligand-receptor patterns into a transition prior for optimal transport, outperforming existing methods on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tissue dynamics (development, regeneration, disease progression, treatment response) requires reliable inference of cellular trajectories from longitudinal, spatial omics data. Existing flow-matching methods lack biological context, potentially yielding less meaningful trajectories.

Method: ContextFlow builds a transition plausibility matrix that encodes local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns, and regularizes the optimal transport objective with these contextual priors to infer spatiotemporal trajectories from longitudinal spatial omics data.

Result: Across three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods on multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Conclusion: Incorporating biological context into trajectory inference yields more statistically consistent and biologically meaningful trajectories, offering a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from spatially resolved omics data.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and
response to treatment. We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow
matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of
structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,
ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

*Dong-Dong Wu,Jiacheng Cui,Wei Wang,Zhiqiang She,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMIS is a unified likelihood-based framework for training diffusion models under imprecise supervision. It decomposes the objective into a generative component that models imprecise-label distributions and a classification component that uses a diffusion classifier to infer class posterior probabilities, aided by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. It yields robust, high-quality, and class-discriminative samples across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often rely on large-scale datasets with noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels. This imprecise supervision causes condition mismatch and degrades generation quality. There is a need for a principled framework that training diffusion models robustly under such supervision.

Method: Derive an objective via likelihood maximization and decompose it into two components: (1) a generative component modeling imprecise-label distributions, and (2) a classification component using a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities. Efficiency is enhanced by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. The framework is evaluated across diverse forms of imprecise supervision.

Result: DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples across tasks such as image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation, demonstrating robustness to imprecise supervision.

Conclusion: DMIS provides a principled, unified approach to training diffusion models under imprecise supervision and improves robustness and sample quality across varied forms of noisy labeling.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised evaluation framework for model generalization under distribution shift; leverages confidence and dispersity signals; hybrid metrics beat single-signal metrics; nuclear norm of the prediction matrix is a robust, versatile metric for both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation, even with class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess model performance and rank models when labeled test data are unavailable, enabling practical, deployment-stage evaluation under distribution shifts.

Method: Systematically benchmark confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across diverse architectures and datasets and shift types; introduce and advocate the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix as a core, robust metric for unsupervised evaluation in both dataset-centric and model-centric settings.

Result: Hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics in both evaluation settings; nuclear norm provides robust and accurate performance signals across tasks, including real-world datasets, and remains reliable under moderate class imbalance.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, generalizable framework for unsupervised model assessment in deployment, with the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix highlighted as a strong, scalable metric for evaluating generalization under distribution shift.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

*Tianqi Liu,Kairui Fu,Shengyu Zhang,Wenyan Fan,Zhaocheng Du,Jieming Zhu,Fan Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHORD enables personalized, resource-aware on-device sequential recommendation via channel-wise mixed-precision quantization guided by cloud-based auxiliary hypernetworks. It achieves personalization and efficiency without on-device retraining, using 2-bit-per-channel encoding to reduce communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying reranking models on diverse mobile devices requires both personalization and computational efficiency. Quantization alone can hurt accuracy on user-specific preferences, while on-device finetuning is expensive. There is a need for device-cloud collaboration that personalizes quantization and adapts to resource constraints.

Method: CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and uses cloud auxiliary hypernetwork modules to identify user-specific critical parameters via multi-granularity (layer, filter, element) sensitivity analysis. It applies channel-wise mixed-precision quantization on-device without backpropagation, enabling dynamic adaptation and faster inference. Communication overhead is minimized by encoding quantization strategies with 2 bits per channel.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets with SASRec and Caser backbones show CHORD achieves improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity for on-device sequential recommendation.

Conclusion: CHORD demonstrates that device-cloud collaborative, mixed-precision quantization can deliver personalized, efficient, retraining-free on-device recommendations across heterogeneous hardware and backbones, with low communication costs.

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BO is powerful but relies on hand-tuned surrogates/acquisitions; there is a need for generalizable, sample-efficient optimization across diverse landscapes in derivative-free settings.

Method: Offline reinforcement learning trained on optimization trajectories from 12 BO variants; scale pretraining with millions of synthetic Gaussian process (GP)-based functions spanning 2D to 20D to learn transferable optimization policies.

Result: ZeroShotOpt exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on unseen benchmarks and matches or surpasses the sample efficiency of leading global optimizers, including BO; provides a reusable foundation for future extension.

Conclusion: Introduces a versatile, pretrained foundation model for global optimization that reduces reliance on hand-tuned hyperparameters and hyperparameter tuning, with open-source code, dataset, and model for community use.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributional offline IRL method that learns reward and return distributions using first-order stochastic dominance to integrate distortion risk measures, yielding distribution-aware policies and improved imitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IRL typically recovers deterministic rewards or matches only expected returns, which misses uncertainty and risk preferences in expert behavior.

Method: Jointly model uncertainty over reward functions and full return distributions; minimize first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) violations to embed distortion risk measures into policy learning, enabling distribution-aware policies.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo tasks show recovery of expressive reward representations and state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: Distributional IRL with FSD constraints enables richer behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation by learning both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies.

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and compare off-policy actor-critic methods in parameterized action spaces to determine trade-offs in speed, stability, and performance, and to assess whether PA spaces can reduce the need for recurrent architectures in complex action settings.

Method: Benchmark SAC, GAC, and TQC in parameterized-action spaces, focusing on discrete actions linked to continuous action-parameter spaces. Use Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 benchmarks.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC

*Mingfeng Fan,Jiaqi Cheng,Yaoxin Wu,Yifeng Zhang,Yibin Yang,Guohua Wu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-decoder DRL model (UD3RL) for CETSP that decouples node selection and waypoint determination, uses k-NN subgraph interactions, and REINFORCE training to generalize across problem sizes and radius types, outperforming conventional methods in quality and speed with robustness to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CETSP extends TSP with a neighborhood visitation criterion, making it NP-hard and challenging for standard DRL methods. There is a need for models that can handle variable neighborhood radii and scale across problem sizes while maintaining solution quality and efficiency.

Method: Formulates CETSP as an MDP with discretization. Proposes UD3RL, consisting of an adapted encoder, a node-decoder for selecting the next node, and a loc-decoder for determining a waypoint within a neighborhood. Includes a k-NN subgraph interaction mechanism to improve spatial reasoning during location decoding. Trains the unified model with a customized REINFORCE algorithm to generalize across problem sizes and different radius types (constant and random).

Result: UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both solution quality and runtime. It shows strong generalization across problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, and is robust to dynamic environments.

Conclusion:  UD3RL provides a unified, scalable DRL framework for CETSP that effectively handles the neighborhood-based visitation criterion, with strong generalization and robustness across variations in size, distribution, and radius, indicating its broad potential for related neighborhood-based routing problems.

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First known algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters under differential privacy, achieving strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale U.S. population datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein barycenters are useful summaries of distributions but their computation on sensitive data raises privacy concerns; differential privacy is needed to protect individual data points.

Method: Develop and empirically evaluate differential privacy algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters; validate on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale population data.

Result: Demonstrates high-quality private barycenters with favorable accuracy-privacy tradeoffs across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Differentially private computation of Wasserstein barycenters is feasible and effective, enabling privacy-preserving transport-based analysis with broad applicability.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under
differential privacy. Empirically, on synthetic data, MNIST, and large-scale
U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

### [129] [Lightweight Transformer for EEG Classification via Balanced Signed Graph Algorithm Unrolling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03027)
*Junyi Yao,Parham Eftekhar,Gene Cheung,Xujin Chris Liu,Yao Wang,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, interpretable transformer-like model for EEG-based epilepsy detection that unrolls a spectral denoising algorithm on balanced signed graphs, using a Lanczos-based low-pass filter with learnable cutoff, achieving competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Epilepsy detection from EEG is challenging due to intrinsic anti-correlations in brain signals. Balanced signed graphs provide a principled, interpretable structure to model such anti-correlations, enabling efficient spectral filtering and classification.

Method: Unroll a spectral denoising algorithm on signals on a balanced signed graph (no odd-length negative cycles). Map the balanced signed Laplacian to a positive graph via a similarity transform. Implement an ideal low-pass filter on the mapped graph using Lanczos approximation, with the cutoff learned from data. Use two balanced-signed-denoiser branches that learn posterior class probabilities; evaluate reconstruction errors for binary EEG classification.

Result: The method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep learning models while using dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The approach yields a lightweight, interpretable, transformer-like architecture for graph-structured EEG data, leveraging balanced signed graphs and spectral denoising with learned filters to effectively distinguish epilepsy patients from healthy controls.

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

*Liyang Xie,Haoran Zhang,Zhendong Wang,Wesley Tansey,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Score distillation enables few-step diffusion-based protein backbone generation, achieving ~20x sampling speed while preserving design quality compared to the teacher model (Proteina).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and flow-based generative models produce high-quality protein backbones but are slow due to hundreds of reverse-diffusion steps. There's a need for scalable, large-scale protein design, which requires faster sampling without sacrificing designability, diversity, or novelty.

Method: Adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD) to train few-step protein backbone generators. Key components include multistep generation and inference-time noise modulation. The approach distills knowledge from a pretrained teacher (Proteina) into a lightweight, few-step generator to reduce sampling iterations while maintaining performance.

Result: The distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold speedup in sampling time, with designability, diversity, and novelty comparable to the Proteina teacher model.

Conclusion: Score distillation can make diffusion-based protein design practical at large scale by significantly reducing inference cost, enabling high-throughput in silico design while preserving generation quality and designability.

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

*Soohaeng Yoo Willow,Tae Hyeon Park,Gi Beom Sim,Sung Wook Moon,Seung Kyu Min,D. ChangMo Yang,Hyun Woo Kim,Juho Lee,Chang Woo Myung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with a joint energy-forces negative log-likelihood loss (NLL_JEF) to quantify uncertainty in atomistic ML potentials, enabling robust active learning, OOD detection, and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is essential for reliability in MLPs, especially for active learning, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in large-scale atomistic simulations.

Method: Develops Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body message passing and a joint energy-force NLL loss that explicitly models uncertainties in energies and interatomic forces. Benchmarks multiple Bayesian approaches (deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation, SWA-Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and Laplace approximation), uses BALD for active learning, and evaluates uncertainty prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and energy/force predictions.

Result: NLL_JEF yields superior accuracy compared to conventional NLL losses. Among Bayesian methods, deep ensembles, SWA-Gaussian, online Newton variants, and Laplace approximations provide competitive uncertainty estimates and enable effective active learning; BALD-based sampling outperforms random or energy-based sampling.

Conclusion: Bayesian equivariant neural networks offer a powerful framework for uncertainty-aware MLPs in atomistic simulations at scale, enabling uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and calibration without sacrificing competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

*Yoontae Hwang,Stefan Zohren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT) uses path signatures and a signature-augmented attention to enable end-to-end, risk-aware asset allocation; it outperforms baselines on daily S&P 100 data, underscoring the value of geometry-aware methods in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address objective mismatch and error amplification in deep-learning forecasters for portfolio allocation by learning directly with risk-aware objectives and by embedding financial inductive biases.

Method: Propose path signatures to provide a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented attention mechanism that encodes financial biases (e.g., lead-lag effects); train end-to-end to optimize a risk-aware objective; evaluate on daily S&P 100 data; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Result: SIT decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, with notable gains over predict-then-optimize models.

Conclusion: Portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems.

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

### [133] [Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086)
*Marc Lelarge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A chain of GNNs iteratively refines node-pair similarities to solve graph alignment, achieving large gains and solving regular graphs where others fail; complements optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph alignment is NP-hard and standard GNNs struggle to beat classical optimization methods; need models that exploit global structure and iterative refinement.

Method: Train a sequence of GNNs where each network refines similarity matrices produced by previous networks; uses a node-pair architecture that processes node pairs to capture global structural patterns; during inference, a bootstrap effect leverages discrete ranking information about alignment quality from prior iterations.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks show over 3x accuracy improvements over existing methods; uniquely solve regular graphs where competing approaches fail; when combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on graph alignment benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chained GNNs with a node-pair design and iterative refinement substantially improve graph alignment performance, bridging the gap between ML-based approaches and traditional optimization, and are effective as a post-processing booster to conventional solvers.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

### [134] [Adaptive Node Feature Selection For Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03096)
*Ali Azizpour,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An intervention-based, permutation-driven feature selection for GNNs that identifies and drops unnecessary node features during training, producing dynamic feature importance scores and broad applicability across architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-structured data exhibit complex dependencies between node features and graph topology, making classical feature-importance metrics unreliable. A model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training is needed.

Method: During training, permute feature values and monitor the change in validation performance to assess each feature's contribution. The method returns feature importance scores after training and tracks how relevance evolves as features are dropped, with theoretical grounding linking GNN performance to node data–graph structure relationships.

Result: Empirical results show the approach is flexible across different GNN architectures and adaptable to more challenging graph learning settings; it also enables monitoring whether feature elimination is effective and enables evaluation of other metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed intervention-based, permutation-driven feature selection for GNNs provides a versatile, interpretable mechanism to identify and drop irrelevant features during training, yielding dynamic relevance scores and broad applicability across architectures and tasks.

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

*Irene Tenison,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Fahim Kawsar,Mohammad Malekzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBet is a gradient-free layer selection method that uses Betti Numbers to analyze activation-space topology from forward passes, ranking layers by learning capacity to enable on-device retraining without labels or gradients; across 16 model/dataset pairs it yields about +5% accuracy versus gradient-based baselines and ~40% memory reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pre-trained networks on edge/mobile devices under strict compute/memory limits is crucial. Gradient-based on-device retraining across all layers is prohibitively costly, and existing layer-retraining approaches often require labels, full backprop, or server-side meta-training.

Method: Compute topological features (Betti Numbers) of activation spaces for each layer using forward passes. Rank layers by their learning capacity and selectively retrain high-impact layers without using labels or gradients.

Result:  evaluated on sixteen model/dataset pairs; AdaBet achieves an average 5% improvement in classification accuracy over gradient-based baselines and reduces peak memory usage by about 40%.

Conclusion: AdaBet provides a practical, gradient-free, label-free approach for efficient on-device adaptation by selecting high-learning-capacity layers, lowering memory footprint while maintaining or improving accuracy; shows promise for constrained devices.

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

TL;DR: A ConvLSTM-based model that uses historical headways and planned terminal headways to predict spatiotemporal headway propagation along an entire metro line, enabling real-time dispatch decisions without heavy simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance service reliability, resource utilization, and passenger satisfaction by forecasting headway dynamics and enabling evaluation of terminal-headway strategies in real time.

Method: Develop a ConvLSTM framework that ingests historical headway data and planned terminal headways to forecast future headways across all stations. Include a flexible simulator of dispatcher strategies (e.g., even headways, observed terminal departures patterns) to assess impacts without full-scale simulations.

Result: The model achieves promising headway predictions on a large urban metro dataset and supports efficient evaluation of dispatching strategies, offering actionable insights for real-time decision-making.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computationally efficient tool for optimizing dispatching strategies, improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

*Flavio Giorgi,Matteo Silvestri,Cesare Campagnano,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a pipeline that uses both large and small Language Models to craft counterfactual narratives for explaining model decisions, with distillation and refinement to empower smaller models, and a lightweight evaluation method to check alignment with ground truth, aiming to improve reasoning and practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI seeks accessible, accurate explanations of model decisions. Counterfactual explanations are promising but often technical; this work aims to democratize them by generating natural-language narratives and by distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller, deployable models, accompanied by a simple evaluation to ensure fidelity.

Method: 1) Train/generate counterfactual narratives using both large and small Language Models. 2) Apply knowledge distillation and a refining mechanism so small models retain robust reasoning and narrative quality. 3) Introduce a simple evaluation metric to assess whether narratives align with factual and counterfactual ground truth. 4) Evaluate on practical use cases to show improved reasoning and deployment viability of student models.

Result: The approach is claimed to enhance reasoning capabilities and practical performance of student models, with small LMs achieving behavior comparable to larger LMs and narratives aligning with ground-truth in the evaluation method, enabling more accessible, real-world explanations.

Conclusion: A narrative-based, distillation-driven pipeline can make counterfactual explanations from AI models more understandable to non-experts while preserving reasoning quality and deployability, addressing both interpretability and practicality in Explainable AI.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

*Dhruv Rohatgi,Abhishek Shetty,Donya Saless,Yuchen Li,Ankur Moitra,Andrej Risteski,Dylan J. Foster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new test-time sampling method, VGB, uses probabilistic backtracking guided by a verifier to robustly combine language models with process verifiers, mitigating error amplification and outperforming baselines. The approach is theoretically grounded via connections to Sinclair-Jerrum random walks and shows improvements on synthetic and real tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the opaque algorithmic design space and high costs of learning high-quality verifiers, and to mitigate catastrophic failures caused by small verifier errors during generation.

Method: Propose VGB, a process-guided test-time sampling algorithm that views autoregressive generation as a random walk on a tree of partial generations. Backtracking occurs probabilistically and is guided by the verifier and base model. The approach generalizes the Sinclair-Jerrum random walk from approximate counting literature and provides theoretical grounding. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real language modeling tasks.

Result: VGB outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics across both synthetic and real language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: Process-guided backtracking offers provably better robustness to verifier errors and connects LM decoding with the Sinclair-Jerrum random-walk literature, showing promise for robust test-time generation when using verifiers.

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High-rate quantization theory is used to analyze mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression, showing how many tiny input-space regions with constant predictors affect approximation and learning errors; the paper derives 1D and multi-D error formulations, bounds, and learning properties, highlighting a tradeoff governed by the number of experts.

Motivation: Provide theoretical insight into MoE regression models by leveraging high-rate quantization concepts, to quantify approximation error, guide segmentation/expert design, and understand learning behavior.

Method: Model MoE as a segmentation of the input space into regions, each region served by a single-parameter (constant) expert with zero inference cost. Under the assumption of a large number of small regions, derive (i) 1D test/error minimizers for segmentation and experts; (ii) an upper bound on test error for multi-dimensional inputs and its minimization; analyze learning of expert parameters given a fixed segmentation and derive their statistical properties.

Result: Formulates the test error and its minimizers in 1D; provides an upper bound for the test error in multi-D settings; characterizes the statistical learning properties of the expert parameters; theoretical and empirical results illustrate how the approximation-estimation tradeoff in MoE learning scales with the number of experts.

Conclusion: The central finding is that the MoE learning tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors is controlled by the number of experts: more experts reduce approximation error but increase estimation error, implying a need to balance model complexity for optimal performance.

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

### [140] [Calibrated Uncertainty Sampling for Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03162)
*Ha Manh Bui,Iliana Maifeld-Carucci,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a calibration-error–aware acquisition function for pool-based active learning that first estimates calibration error (under covariate shift) and queries samples with the highest calibration error, improving calibration and generalization for DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of model uncertainty is crucial in active learning, especially for deep neural networks where uncertainty estimates are poorly calibrated. Uncalibrated uncertainty can degrade AL performance and generalization.

Method: Introduce a kernel calibration error estimator under covariate shift and use it to rank unlabeled samples by their expected calibration error. The acquisition function selects high-calibration-error samples, followed by leveraging DNN uncertainty for labeling. The authors provide formal results showing bounded calibration error on the pool and unseen test data and demonstrate empirical improvements.

Result: Empirically outperforms baseline acquisition functions by achieving lower calibration error and better generalization across pool-based AL scenarios.

Conclusion: Calibration-aware acquisition in active learning can substantially improve both calibration and generalization of DNN-based classifiers, and the proposed estimator provides a principled approach under covariate shift.

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

### [141] [Why Do We Need Warm-up? A Theoretical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03164)
*Foivos Alimisis,Rustem Islamov,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Warm-up improves training because a generalized L0,L1-smoothness condition explains faster convergence of gradient descent when the learning rate is gradually increased; theory plus experiments show benefits for language and vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled theoretical foundation for learning rate warm-up, a widely used heuristic, by introducing a generalized smoothness condition that bounds curvature as a function of sub-optimality and has desirable closure properties.

Method: Define and analyze an L0,L1-smoothness generalization; prove upper and lower convergence bounds for gradient descent with a warm-up schedule under this condition; show that the condition holds for common neural architectures with MSE and cross-entropy losses; conduct empirical validation on language and vision tasks.

Result: Under the generalized smoothness assumption, gradient descent with warm-up converges faster than with fixed step-size; theoretical bounds align with observed training speedups; experiments on language and vision models corroborate practical benefits.

Conclusion: Warm-up schedules are theoretically justified under the L0,L1-smoothness framework and practically beneficial, offering insight into when and why to use warm-up and guiding future optimization strategies.

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

*Irene Tenison,Anna Murphy,Charles Beauville,Lalana Kagal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FTTE is a semi-asynchronous federated learning framework for edge devices that uses sparse updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on age and variance to mitigate stragglers and resource constraints. It achieves faster convergence, lower on-device memory, and reduced communication payloads, while maintaining target accuracy comparable to or better than existing semi-asynchronous baselines across large-scale, heterogeneous networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable scalable, real-world FL on resource-constrained edge devices by addressing memory, energy, and communication bottlenecks, as well as straggler delays and heterogeneity that hinder traditional synchronous/asynchronous FL.

Method: Introduce FTTE (Federated Tiny Training Engine): a semi-asynchronous FL framework using sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation that accounts for both the age and variance of client updates. Validate across diverse models/data distributions with up to 500 clients and up to 90% stragglers.

Result: FTTE achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower on-device memory usage, and 69% reduction in communication payload versus synchronous FL (FedAVG); consistently reaches comparable or higher target accuracy than semi-asynchronous baselines (e.g., FedBuff) in challenging regimes.

Conclusion: FTTE represents a practical and scalable solution for real-world FL on heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge devices, demonstrating robust performance in the presence of stragglers and network heterogeneity.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

### [143] [Q-Learning with Shift-Aware Upper Confidence Bound in Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03181)
*Ha Manh Bui,Felix Parker,Kimia Ghobadi,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware Q-learning UCB algorithm for non-stationary RL; it detects distribution shifts via a transition density, improves uncertainty estimates, and achieves better regret than QUCB both theoretically and empirically, including a real COVID-19 hospital allocation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary RL under distribution shifts can render standard Q-learning UCB suboptimal after shifts. There is a need for shift detection and robust exploration-exploitation strategies that maintain good performance across changing environments.

Method: Develop Density-QUCB (DQUCB), which uses a transition density function to detect distribution shifts and integrates the shift likelihood into the uncertainty estimation of Q-learning UCB. The approach is applicable to finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted MDPs and maintains model-free computational efficiency. An oracle version is analyzed for regret improvements.

Result: Theoretically, oracle DQUCB achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, DQUCB attains lower regret than QUCB baselines across multiple RL tasks and a real-world COVID-19 patient hospital allocation task implemented with Deep-Q-learning.

Conclusion: DQUCB provides a shift-aware, efficient, model-free RL method that improves regret performance under distribution shifts, with demonstrated effectiveness on synthetic tasks and a real-world healthcare allocation problem.

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

*Wanjia Zhao,Qinwei Ma,Jingzhe Shi,Shirley Wu,Jiaqi Han,Yijia Xiao,Si-Yuan Chen,Xiao Luo,Ludwig Schmidt,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM-Physics offers a DAG-based, process-level physics evaluation with symbolic equivalence checks and theoretical guarantees, aligning with expert scoring and exposing LLM reasoning limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics benchmarks traditionally report only final answers, missing reasoning trails. Existing stepwise methods rely on heuristics or linear assumptions, reducing reliability and diagnostic value. There is a need for a principled, interpretable, process-focused evaluation for complex physics reasoning.

Method: Represent solutions as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas to explicitly encode causal dependencies among intermediate steps. Prove the optimality of this DAG representation and scoring policy. Develop a fully rule-based symbolic equivalence matcher to validate formulae across diverse formulations without heuristic judgments.

Result: The framework better aligns with human expert scoring than prior benchmarks. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent physics reasoning failures; step-level scoring provides diagnostic insight and signals for model training.

Conclusion: PRISM-Physics provides a principled, theoretically grounded foundation for process-level evaluation in physics, enabling deeper reasoning capabilities and guiding model development with structural rigor and symbolic validation.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

### [145] [Superposition disentanglement of neural representations reveals hidden alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03186)
*André Longon,David Klindt,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Superposition of features may distort representational alignment metrics; disentangling superposition improves cross-model/brain alignment assessments and is necessary to reveal true representation similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representational alignment metrics compare information across networks or brains, but the superposition hypothesis posits that neurons can carry multiple features. This can confound alignment measurements, especially if different models encode the same features with different linear combinations, leading to underestimation of true similarity.

Method: The authors develop a theory for how strict permutation-based alignment metrics depend on superposition. They test it by training sparse autoencoders to disentangle superposition in toy models, and then assess alignment (semi-matching, soft-matching, and linear regression) in DNN→DNN and DNN→brain settings in the visual domain.

Result: Toy-model alignment scores increase when base neurons are replaced by sparse overcomplete latent codes. Similar increases are observed for DNN↔DNN and DNN↔brain linear regression alignment in the visual domain, suggesting that superposition can obscure true alignment and that disentangling it reveals higher, more accurate similarity.

Conclusion: Superposition disentanglement is necessary for mapping metrics to accurately uncover true representational alignment across networks and brains; failure to account for superposition may lead to underestimating shared representations.

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

### [146] [Estimation of Resistance Training RPE using Inertial Sensors and Electromyography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03197)
*James Thomas,Johan Wahlström*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wearable-based ML estimation of RPE during bicep curls; random forest best with ~41% exact accuracy and ~86% within ±1 RPE; EMG adds marginal benefit; eccentric repetition time is key predictor; generalizability challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized feedback, safer resistance training, and injury prevention by estimating RPE from wearable sensors.

Method: Collected a custom dataset of 69 sets (>1000 repetitions) during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls. Extracted statistical features from inertial and EMG sensors. Evaluated multiple ML models; random forest achieved highest performance; compared inertial alone vs inertial+EMG; assessed exact accuracy and ±1 RPE accuracy; analyzed feature importance.

Result: Random forest achieved 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% ±1 RPE accuracy. EMG provided slight improvement over inertial-only; data quality and placement sensitivity may limit effectiveness. Eccentric repetition time emerged as the strongest predictor.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation; highlights challenges for improving generalizability and accuracy; suggests focus on data quality, sensor placement, and possibly feature engineering to boost model performance.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

### [147] [Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199)
*Qiwei Di,Kaixuan Ji,Xuheng Li,Heyang Zhao,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Best-of-Majority (BoM), a new inference strategy that fuses majority voting and Best-of-N (BoN) for LLM prompts under Pass@k; BoM restricts candidates to high-frequency responses in N samples and selects top-k, achieving minimax-optimal regret with N ≥ ~Ω(C*). It outperforms MV and BoN on math problems and remains robust as N grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference strategies (majority voting, Best-of-N) do not scale well with the sampling budget N or the decision horizon k in Pass@k settings. There is a need for an inference rule that combines their strengths and maintains performance when increasing resources.

Method: Propose BoM with a pivotal step: filter the N sampled responses to those with high frequency, then choose the top-k rewards from this restricted set. The authors provide a theoretical analysis showing regret O(ε_opt + sqrt(ε_RM^2 C*/k)) when N = Õ(C*), and prove a matching lower bound, establishing minimax optimality. They also provide experiments on math problems comparing BoM to MV and BoN.

Result: BoM achieves minimax-optimal regret in Pass@k inference with a sampling budget N on the order of C*. It does not degrade with larger N and outperforms both majority voting and BoN in empirical math tasks.

Conclusion: BoM effectively blends the strengths of MV and BoN, providing robustness to resource scaling and theoretical optimality guarantees, with practical improvements demonstrated in math problem solving.

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

### [148] [To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03207)
*Yuda Song,Dhruv Rohatgi,Aarti Singh,J. Andrew Bagnell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates when privileged expert distillation helps RL under partial observability, showing that benefits depend on latent dynamics stochasticity and that the best latent policy for acting is not always the best to distill; it proposes guidelines for using privileged information to improve sample efficiency in POMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability makes learning policies difficult; privileged information (latent states) can separate perception from action, enabling faster, more stable learning. However, distillation from privileged signals has failure modes; understanding when and how to use it can improve policy learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a simple perturbed Block MDP model to capture latent dynamics, plus controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks. The study contrasts approximate decodability with belief contraction to explain when privileged distillation helps, and investigates whether the optimal latent policy is the best to distill.

Result: Findings show that the trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL depends on the stochasticity of latent dynamics, aligned with the theoretical notions of decodability vs belief contraction. Additionally, the latent policy that is optimal for acting is not necessarily the best to distill. These results yield practical guidelines for exploiting privileged information to improve policy learning in partially observable domains.

Conclusion: Privileged information can improve data efficiency and learning performance in POMDPs, but its effectiveness is conditioned on latent dynamics, and naive distillation of the truly optimal latent policy may be suboptimal. The work calls for principled guidelines to leverage privileged states in real-world RL tasks.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

*Guanhua Huang,Tingqiang Xu,Mingze Wang,Qi Yi,Xue Gong,Siheng Li,Ruibin Xiong,Kejiao Li,Yuhao Jiang,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg) preserves valuable low-probability tokens during RLVR by regularizing toward a filtered heuristic proxy, enabling longer stable on-policy exploration and achieving state-of-the-art math benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR improves large language models' reasoning but faces a training bottleneck: performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, indicating loss of exploration. Prior entropy-focused methods may amplify irrelevant tokens and destabilize training. This work identifies that valuable low-probability exploratory tokens—'reasoning sparks'—tend to be eliminated during RLVR, hindering exploration.

Method: Introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Construct a heuristic proxy distribution by filtering out presumed noise tokens and renormalizing over the remaining candidates. Regularize the policy toward this proxy using a soft target (via KL divergence) to amplify low-probability 'reasoning sparks' and shield them from elimination. Enable stable on-policy training for roughly 1,000 steps, where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.

Result: Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps (a regime where baselines collapse). This sustained exploration yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving 60.17% average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of 2.66% over prior methods.

Conclusion: Low-probability Regularization effectively preserves valuable low-probability exploratory tokens during RLVR, improving both exploration quality and final performance, with the method releasing code at the provided link.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

TL;DR: XR-based planning toolkit (ERUPT) enables interactive motion planning in immersive XR, with dynamic environment editing, MoveIt integration, real-time path visualization, and deployment to physical robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial understanding and natural interaction in robot motion planning by leveraging immersive XR to manipulate environments and plan safer, more intuitive paths.

Method: Develop ERUPT as an XR system integrated with MoveIt, allowing users to create/reconfigure environments, manipulate objects, visualize planned robot paths in VR/AR, and deploy to physical robots.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility: users can visualize, adjust, and verify robot motions in XR with collision-free visualization in virtual space, and deploy planned paths to real robots.

Conclusion: ERUPT shows promise for intuitive, safe XR-assisted planning with real-world deployment; future work could explore quantitative user studies, performance, and scalability.

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the
scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates
with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion
planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or
augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing
users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot.
Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired
behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions
within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in
the real world.

TL;DR: A language-guided, Gaussian-splat-based driving scene editor (SIMSplat) enables intuitive object-level edits and predictive multi-agent motion to generate realistic scenarios, demonstrated on Waymo data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving simulators struggle with realistic, flexible editing and can't easily incorporate natural-language prompts; need for intuitive, controllable scene manipulation to create diverse, realistic traffic scenes.

Method: Introduce SIMSplat, a language-aligned Gaussian splatting framework that maps natural language prompts to Gaussian-reconstructed scene representations; supports querying of road objects, adding objects, editing trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians, and uses multi-agent motion prediction to refine paths for realistic interactions.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluation on Waymo dataset showing extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across scenarios; demonstrates realistic interactions and the feasibility of language-driven, object-level edits.

Conclusion: SIMSplat provides an effective, intuitive tool for driving-scene editing via language prompts, combining object-level manipulation with predictive motion; it offers flexible editing and realistic generation across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise

including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles

### [152] [U-LAG: Uncertainty-Aware, Lag-Adaptive Goal Retargeting for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02526)
*Anamika J H,Anujith Muraleedharan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Modular, uncertainty-aware mid-execution goal retargeting (U-LAG/UAR-PF) improves robustness to perception lag and pose shifts in robot manipulation by retargeting goals between perception and control; evaluated on a Shift x Lag benchmark across pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual delays, noise, and stale observations degrade manipulation; existing retargeting methods (motion retargeting, visual servoing) are not designed for in-flight goal re-aiming; a first-class, pluggable retargeting module can improve robustness without changing low-level controllers.

Method: Introduce U-LAG with UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals that maximize expected progress; implement a pluggable retargeting interface between perception and control; validate on a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion with in-plane shifts (0–10 cm) and perception lag (0–400 ms).

Result: UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully under shift and lag compared with a no-retarget baseline, achieving higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple safeguards further improve stability.

Conclusion: UAR-PF enables lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; provides a pluggable retargeting interface; and offers a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation across diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

TL;DR: A sim-to-real imitation learning framework using world models that blends online imitation pretraining in simulation with offline finetuning to overcome data coverage limits in offline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline imitation learning struggles with limited coverage from scarce expert data; simulators can provide richer interactions to bootstrap learning.

Method: Use world models in a sim-to-real loop, perform online imitation pretraining via simulation, then offline finetuning on real data; benefits from online data to improve coverage and transfer robustness.

Result: Significant gains over offline baselines: at least 31.7% higher success in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: This framework improves robustness and generalization during domain transfer and mitigates performance degradation during finetuning, enabling better imitation with limited real data.

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited
amount of real-world expert data. Existing offline imitation methods often
struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation
learning. Our sim-to-real framework is based on world models and combines
online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online
interactions, our approach alleviates the data coverage limitations of offline
methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

*Mohammad Abtahi,Navid Mojahed,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven bilinear Koopman MPC for mobile robots in dynamic environments that outperforms nonlinear MPC by solving a QP in lifted space, capturing nonlinear dynamics and collision constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, safe path planning for mobile robots in dynamic environments requires handling nonlinear dynamics and collision constraints with low computation; linear Koopmanizations often miss nonlinear state–input couplings, limiting performance.

Method: Apply extended dynamic mode decomposition to input–state data to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations; show bilinear models capture nonlinear state–input couplings and quadratic terms; formulate a quadratic program for path planning in the lifted space; implement in an MPC framework for dynamic obstacles.

Result: Open-loop analysis shows only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture the necessary nonlinear couplings and quadratic terms for collision avoidance; linear realizations fail. The approach finds the safe optimal action and runs approximately 320x faster than a nonlinear MPC operating in the original state space.

Conclusion: Bilinear Koopman realizations offer a promising path to linearize highly nonlinear optimal control problems with nonlinear state and input constraints, achieving computational efficiency similar to linear problems and enabling efficient MPC-based planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SubSense is a VR-haptic framework that adds non-invasive haptic feedback to a 1-DOF underwater manipulator, paired with glove-based feedback, to improve teleoperation of ROVs; validated with experiments and user studies; outperforms traditional 2D-visual interfaces, especially for delicate tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROV teleoperation relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive sensory feedback, leading to poor situational awareness in complex subsea environments. The paper motivates the development of multisensory, intuitive interfaces to enhance remote operation accuracy and safety.

Method: Develop SubSense, a VR-haptic framework with a non-invasive feedback interface attached to a 1-DOF manipulator, paired with the operator's glove to provide haptic feedback and grasp status. Integrate end-to-end software to manage control inputs and render immersive camera views via VR. Validate through comprehensive experiments and user studies.

Result: The system demonstrates improved effectiveness over conventional teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Multisensory feedback in immersive VR environments significantly enhances remote situational awareness and mission performance, suggesting more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in field trials.

Conclusion: Multisensory VR-haptic integration for underwater teleoperation is promising for improving situational awareness, precision, and usability, enabling more intuitive control and broader adoption of ROVs in challenging subsea environments.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual

*Harsh Gupta,Xiaofeng Guo,Huy Ha,Chuer Pan,Muqing Cao,Dongjae Lee,Sebastian Sherer,Shuran Song,Guanya Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UMI-on-Air presents Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP) to transfer general manipulation skills learned from unconstrained handheld demonstrations to constrained robotic embodiments like aerial manipulators. By coupling a high-level diffusion policy with a low-level, embodiment-specific controller and injecting gradient feedback from the controller into diffusion sampling, the approach yields embodiment-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories at test time, enabling plug-and-play adaptation across diverse embodiments with improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A major gap exists between demonstrations collected with unconstrained, human-guided systems (UMI) and the dynamics of constrained robots (e.g., aerial manipulators). This mismatch leads to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. There is a need for embodiment-aware transfer that preserves generality while ensuring feasibility on deployment devices.

Method: Train a high-level UMI policy from unconstrained demonstrations and couple it at inference with a low-level embodiment-specific controller (tracking cost). During diffusion sampling, incorporate gradient feedback from the controller’s tracking cost to steer trajectory generation toward dynamically feasible modes for the target embodiment, enabling test-time, plug-and-play adaptation. Validate on long-horizon, high-precision aerial manipulation tasks and compare to unguided diffusion baselines.

Result: Out-of-distribution issues are mitigated; improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under disturbances for long-horizon aerial manipulation tasks compared to unguided baselines. Demonstrates deployment in unseen environments using wild UMI demonstrations, signaling scalable generalization across diverse constrained embodiments.

Conclusion: Embodiment-aware diffusion with test-time gradient feedback enables practical cross-embodiment generalization of manipulation skills. The approach provides a plug-and-play mechanism for adapting high-level policies to specific embodiments, improving feasibility and robustness in constrained robotic systems.

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

*Mobin Habibpour,Alireza Nemati,Ali Meghdari,Alireza Taheri,Shima Nazari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time semantic RGB-D SLAM method for dynamic environments that detects moving objects and preserves a static map, using semantic cues, EKF-based dynamic object handling, and a generative inpainting network, achieving ~22 FPS on a GTX 1080 and competitive localization on dynamic TUM sequences with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard visual SLAM assumes a static world and degrades in dynamic scenes, limiting robustness in many robotics applications (e.g., social robots). There is a need for methods that can distinguish dynamic from static elements and maintain accurate localization and mapping in real time.

Method: The approach integrates deep-learning-based semantic segmentation into a SLAM pipeline to identify dynamic objects, uses an Extended Kalman Filter to detect transiently idle dynamic objects, and employs a generative network to fill missing regions caused by moving objects. The system is modular, implemented on ROS, and achieves around 22 frames per second on a GTX 1080. It is evaluated on dynamic sequences from the TUM RGB-D benchmark, comparing localization error against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieves competitive localization accuracy with near-real-time performance on dynamic sequences, outperforming or matching several state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a static map for robust camera tracking. The code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic information and dynamic-object handling into SLAM enables robust operation in dynamic environments and can be implemented in a modular, real-time ROS framework, making dynamic SLAM practical for applications such as social robotics.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

*Taha Shafa,Yiming Meng,Melkior Ornik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An algorithm ensures a system with unknown dynamics can track a piecewise linear trajectory by locally learning dynamics via small perturbations, computing a provably reachable set under those local models, and synthesizing control to reach a guaranteed reachable state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle abrupt, critical changes in system dynamics where full model knowledge is unavailable, enabling reliable trajectory following without pre-identified dynamics.

Method: 1) Apply small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current state. 2) Compute the set of states that are provably reachable using the locally learned dynamics and their maximum growth-rate bounds. 3) Synthesize a control action that navigates the system to a guaranteed reachable state.

Result: The paper demonstrates that it is possible to follow a set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable despite not knowing the system dynamics.

Conclusion: A local-learning, reachability-based control approach can guarantee navigation along a piecewise linear path even under abrupt dynamics changes, providing robustness to model uncertainty.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a
piecewise linear trajectory without prior knowledge of the system dynamics.
Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

*Qun Yang,Soung Chang Liew*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A ROS-compatible 'hold-and-hit' communication-control framework enables robust, untethered multi-robot rigid formation navigation over wireless networks, with intra-cycle optimization to track curvilinear paths under nonholonomic constraints; validated via simulations and real experiments showing low inter-robot distance and orientation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable, wireless, untethered multi-robot formation navigation on microprocessor platforms, especially for complex curvilinear paths, addressing delays, packet loss, and nonholonomic constraints; existing works lack a comprehensive ROS-friendly solution.

Method: Introduce a hold-and-hit framework that synchronizes robot actions across discrete-time control cycles, robust to network delays and packet loss; pair with intra-cycle optimization to closely follow curvilinear paths under nonholonomic constraints; implemented on ROS; validated through simulations (S-shaped path with four-robot square) and real-world experiments.

Result: Simulations show superiority over two existing approaches in maintaining a four-robot square along an S-shaped path; real-world experiments yield inter-robot distance error within ±0.069 m and inter-robot orientation error within ±19.15 degrees at a fixed linear velocity of 0.1 m/s.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, ROS-compatible solution for precise and reliable multi-robot rigid formation navigation over wireless networks, effectively handling delays, packet loss, and nonholonomic constraints, suitable for practical deployment on microprocessor platforms.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A trajectory-generation framework that synthesizes high-density, diverse, and realistic driving scenarios by grid-based environment representation and behavior-aware planning, improving dataset balance and downstream trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving trajectory benchmarks suffer from a long-tail distribution, underrepresenting high-density, safety-critical maneuvers; this limits model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations.

Method: Convert continuous road environments into a structured grid for fine-grained path planning, conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Develop behavior-aware generation via rule-based decision triggers combined with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints to synthesize high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions.

Result: On Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2, the approach substantially increases agent density and behavioral diversity while maintaining motion realism and scenario-level safety. The synthetic data also improves downstream trajectory-prediction models, especially in challenging high-density scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates long-tail biases by generating realistic, diverse, and dense driving scenarios, enabling better generalization and safer evaluation, with clear benefits for downstream tasks and benchmarking.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

### [161] [A $1000\times$ Faster LLM-enhanced Algorithm For Path Planning in Large-scale Grid Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02716)
*Junlin Zeng,Xin Zhang,Xiang Zhao,Yan Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: iLLM-A* is an enhanced LLM-assisted path-planning algorithm for large-scale grid maps, combining optimized A*, incremental LLM learning, and selective waypoint pruning to achieve massive speedups and memory savings over LLM-A* while improving path quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale grid-map path planning suffers from high search time and memory usage. While LLM-based approaches like LLM-A* help, they still face bottlenecks (e.g., excessive reasoning and suboptimal waypoint generation). An improved method is needed to boost efficiency and reduce resource consumption without sacrificing path quality.

Method: iLLM-A* consists of three mechanisms: (1) optimization of A* to reduce search effort and memory footprint; (2) incremental learning to guide the LLM in generating high-quality, consistent waypoints across maps; (3) waypoint selection strategy to choose an appropriate subset of waypoints for A* that preserves path quality while lowering computational cost. The workflow: LLM proposes candidate waypoints; select subset via the strategy; apply A* between neighboring waypoints; compose full path.

Result: Compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* achieves more than 1000× speedup on average and up to 2349.5× in extreme cases, saves up to 58.6% of memory, and yields shorter paths with lower length variance.

Conclusion: iLLM-A* effectively mitigates the bottlenecks of LLM-A* for large-scale grid-map planning, offering substantial speed and memory benefits while improving path quality, indicating strong potential for scalable planning tasks.

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage caption-guided reranking for cross-modal drone navigation improves retrieval by generating captions for top candidates and refining ranking, yielding ~5% Recall gains and winning top-2 in RoboSense 2025 Track 4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Baseline cross-modal retrieval struggles with fine-grained semantic alignment in complex aerial scenes; robust, language-guided retrieval across drones, satellites, and ground cameras is essential for practical robotic navigation.

Method: Stage 1: use baseline to obtain top-20 coarse ranking. Stage 2: generate captions for those candidates using a Vision-Language Model; compute multimodal similarity between captions and the textual query to re-rank and refine results.

Result: Achieves consistent 5% improvement on Recall@1, Recall@5, Recall@10 across metrics; ranked TOP-2 in the RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge.

Conclusion: Caption-derived semantic refinement bridges visual content and natural language, offering tangible gains for cross-view retrieval in real-world robotic navigation; the approach is effective and practical.

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

*Tianyu Li,Yihan Li,Zizhe Zhang,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: We present a framework to generate force-informed simulated data from a single human demonstration and combine it with a compliant policy to improve vision-based imitation learning for contact-rich manipulation tasks; validated on real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuomotor policies struggle with contact-rich manipulation that requires careful compliance and force handling. Data scarcity for force-aware imitation learning and the sim-to-real gap motivate a data-efficient, force-informed approach.

Method: Generate force-informed data in simulation from a single human demonstration; train a visuomotor policy on synthetic data and couple it with a compliant (force-aware) policy to improve contact handling; validate on real-world tasks.

Result: The learned policy exhibits reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions in real-robot tasks (e.g., non-prehensile block flipping and bi-manual object moving), outperforming baselines that ignore force information.

Conclusion: Force-informed, simulation-derived data combined with compliant control improves robustness of visuomotor policies for contact-rich manipulation, enabling data-efficient training validated on real robots.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a

### [164] [Work Zones challenge VLM Trajectory Planning: Toward Mitigation and Robust Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02803)
*Yifan Liao,Zhen Sun,Xiaoyun Qiu,Zixiao Zhao,Wenbing Tang,Xinlei He,Xinhu Zheng,Tianwei Zhang,Xinyi Huang,Xingshuo Han*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematic study of Visual Language Models for work-zone trajectory planning shows a high failure rate (68%), and introduces REACT-Drive, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that uses past failure patterns as constraints and code, guided by retrieval, to substantially improve planning accuracy and speed; validated on ROADWork and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between powerful multimodal VLMs and reliable trajectory planning in work zones with irregular layouts, temporary controls, and dynamic geometry.

Method: Identify common failure patterns through subgraph mining and clustering, validate eight patterns via human verification; develop REACT-Drive that converts prior failures into constraint rules and planning code, and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve similar cases to guide new planning scenarios.

Result: Mainstream VLMs fail in 68.0% of cases. REACT-Drive reduces average displacement error by ~3x compared with VLM baselines on ROADWork using Qwen2.5-VL, and achieves the fastest inference time (~0.58s vs ~17.90s for fine-tuning). Real-vehicle tests across 15 work-zone scenarios demonstrate practicality.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs with retrieval-augmented guidance effectively addresses work-zone trajectory planning challenges, enabling safer, faster, and more reliable planning in dynamic and irregular environments.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

*Andreas Christou,Elliot Lister,Georgia Andreopoulou,Don Mahad,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Closed-loop FES controller adaptively modulates stimulation based on real-time toe clearance, maintaining dorsiflexion with lower stimulation than open-loop across walking conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-loop FES with fixed stimulation can cause overstimulation (fatigue, discomfort) or understimulation (reduced dorsiflexion and higher fall risk). An adaptive, closed-loop approach could improve effectiveness, comfort, and long-term adherence.

Method: Developed a closed-loop FES controller that adjusts stimulation in real time according to toe clearance. The system was tested in healthy participants with induced foot drop, comparing closed-loop to traditional open-loop control across varying walking speeds and surface inclinations. Outcomes included toe clearance, joint kinematics (hips, knees, ankles), and stimulation intensity.

Result: The closed-loop controller maintained adequate toe clearance with no significant impact on hip/knee/ankle angles, while using significantly lower stimulation intensities than the open-loop controller.

Conclusion: Adaptive, need-based FES can match the effectiveness of fixed-intensity systems while reducing stimulation, potentially lowering fatigue and improving long-term user comfort and adherence.

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

*Jeyoung Park,Yeonsub Lim,Seungeun Oh,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Seong-Lyun Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference reduces communication and server computation in edge-cloud collaborative inference for behavior cloning tasks by letting the draft model estimate when verification is needed and skip server ops, achieving substantial latency and bandwidth savings with high task success close to target-only inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support latency-sensitive, distributed ML in 6G (edge-cloud) with HRLLC. For behavior cloning policies, verification/correction cannot be parallelized, so there is a need to selectively skip server operations to reduce latency while maintaining performance.

Method: Introduce action deviation as a proxy for the need of server verification/correction. Develop a path deviation threshold to balance uplink transmission and inference accuracy. Implement selective skipping of communication and server computations based on the draft model's deviation estimate and evaluate on embodied AI tasks.

Result: Uplink transmission and server operations reduced by 40%. End-to-end latency reduced by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without skipping. Task success rate up to 97.03% of that achieved by target model-only inference.

Conclusion: Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference effectively reduces communication and server computation in latency-sensitive embodied AI tasks without substantially sacrificing performance, enabling practical distributed inference in HRLLC-enabled 6G environments.

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

*Charith Premachandra,U-Xuan Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UWB SAR imaging using a mobile robot's path to synthesize a large aperture improves high-resolution mapping and enables loop-closure detection under adverse conditions; validated with classic local feature detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exteroceptive sensors struggle in poor visibility; UWB radar penetrates dust, smoke, rain; single small aperture cannot image well; synthetic aperture via motion allows high-def SAR images to map unknown environments and support loop closures.

Method: Move UWB radar along robot trajectory to synthesize SAR; develop mapping pipeline; evaluate classic feature detectors (SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE, ORB) for loop closure on SAR images; experiments simulate adverse conditions.

Result: Shows viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection in adverse conditions.

Conclusion: UWB SAR imaging with a mobile robot is a promising approach for robust perception and mapping; the pipeline facilitates reliable mapping despite visibility degradation.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

*Faduo Liang,Yunfeng Yang,Shi-Lu Dai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time motion planning framework for safety-critical autonomous navigation that tracks and predicts dynamic obstacles, builds a forward-time-domain map by fusing predicted dynamic points with static clouds, and enforces safety via collision-aware control barrier functions integrated with nonlinear MPC; validated in simulation and real-world with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safe navigation in dynamic environments where obstacles move unpredictably, by predicting future obstacle states and planning with guarantees of safety.

Method: Classify scene point clouds into dynamic/static; track/detect dynamics with Kalman filtering; extrapolate future states of dynamic clouds; merge with static clouds to form a forward-time-domain (FTD) map; formulate CBF constraints based on risk points from predicted collisions with the FTD map; solve using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments show improved safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance compared to two baselines; algorithm demonstrates effective dynamic/static obstacle handling; source code released.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic obstacle prediction with forward-time planning and CBF-constrained NMPC provides a robust framework for safety-critical navigation in complex environments, with demonstrated empirical advantages and reproducibility through released code.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Examines how numerical social navigation metrics relate to human evaluations; finds current metrics partly reflect behavior but miss key subjective aspects, indicating a need for new standardized metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, comparable evaluation of human-aware navigation by reducing reliance on costly surveys; the absence of a standard metric suite hinders cross-system comparisons.

Method: Empirical analysis of correlations between existing numerical metrics and human-centered survey results across navigation scenarios to assess alignment.

Result: Current metrics capture some behavioral aspects but underrepresent subjective factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility; correlations with human judgments are insufficient, signaling the need for new metrics.

Conclusion: Advocate development and validation of new standardized metrics or evaluation toolkit to better align objective measures with human perception and facilitate fair comparisons across systems.

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A minimal brachiation robot using a single rigid rod with end grippers; COM reposition via a crank-slide; bang-bang optimal control for COM, followed by input-output linearization for a continuous, torque-limited controller; energy-aware design; simulations compare strategies; hardware implementation on STM32 with experimental validation of swing and rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve energy-efficient, low-cost brachiation with a minimal mechanical design by exploiting COM repositioning and a crank-slide, and to validate the approach both in simulation and on a microcontroller hardware platform.

Method: Model non-linear dynamics; develop bang-bang optimal control to reposition the center of mass; apply input-output linearization to obtain a continuous controller that respects torque limits and geometry; emphasize energy accumulation for jump; compare strategies in simulations; implement continuous strategy on an STM32 and validate swing/rotation experimentally.

Result: Simulations show the two strategies are validated and compared; the continuous controller is implemented on STM32; both swing and rotation stages are experimentally validated; energy-focused design aids jump performance.

Conclusion: The work delivers a complete mechatronic design for a minimal brachiation robot, demonstrates two control strategies (bang-bang COM repositioning and continuous IO-linearized control), and confirms feasibility through simulations and hardware experiments on a low-cost platform.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lateral-sideways model based on differential slipstream forces and a yaw-focused control scheme improves lateral dynamics and yaw authority for tail-sitter hover UAVs, validated via Unity simulations showing stable tracking and controlled yaw.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tail-sitter UAVs suffer from strong aerodynamic coupling and poorly defined lateral dynamics in hover, making precise lateral motion control difficult. There is a need for decoupled, yaw-centric lateral control to enhance maneuverability without inducing roll coupling.

Method: Introduce a sideslip force model from differential propeller slipstream effects on the fuselage under differential thrust, producing a lateral force along the body y-axis. Use a YXZ Euler rotation formulation to incorporate gravity and directly control yaw in the y-axis, enabling yaw-based lateral position control without roll coupling. Validate via trajectory-tracking simulations in Unity on rectangular and circular hover paths.

Result: The approach yields stable trajectory tracking with low mean absolute position errors and yaw deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees across tested paths.

Conclusion: The lateral force generation model is effective and provides a foundation for agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs with improved yaw authority and decoupled lateral control.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel intelligent multi-IMU framework estimates pose of vertical, flexible manipulators by fusing low-cost IMU data with a PSO-tuned complementary filter and RBFNN residual correction, achieving sub-millimeter and sub-milliradian RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pose estimation of flexible manipulators using inexpensive IMUs is challenging due to noise, drift, and delay; ground-truth calibration is used to optimize performance.

Method: Model the flexible link as a series of rigid segments; estimate joint angles from accelerometer and gyroscope data from multiple IMUs; fuse data with a complementary filter whose parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization; compensate residual errors with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) trained on ground-truth data.

Result: Experimental results show RMSE of 0.00021 m (y), 0.00041 m (z), and 0.00024 rad (theta), validating the effectiveness of the method.

Conclusion: The proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation framework effectively improves pose estimation for flexible manipulators using low-cost IMUs, with calibrated fusion and residual correction yielding high accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and
0.00024~rad for $y$, $z$, and $\theta$, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical real-time control under uncertainties and disturbances necessitates accurate, robust trajectory tracking in heavy-duty skid-steered platforms.

Method: Developed a multiple-shooting nonlinear model-predictive control framework integrated with sensor data for real-time performance; applied to trajectory tracking experiments on a heavy-duty skid-steered platform.

Result: The controller achieved high tracking accuracy and speed; showed remarkable improvement over existing NMPC controllers on similar platforms under various trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework offers a feasible, superior real-time control solution for skid-steered platforms, enhancing safety and performance in uncertain, disturbance-prone environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

TL;DR: Diffusion models enable end-to-end generation of long, smooth, high-coverage robot trajectories for industrial surface-processing tasks, outperforming traditional methods and generalizing to unseen shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional trajectory generation methods rely on predefined functional forms, which limit trajectory shapes and generalization, making it hard to handle diverse industrial tasks like polishing, painting, and spray coating. There is a need for more expressive generative models that can generalize across tasks without manual redesign.

Method: An end-to-end diffusion-model framework that iteratively denoises trajectories with learned noise schedules and task-conditioned guidance to produce long, smooth trajectories with high surface coverage across multiple industrial tasks.

Result: The method improves trajectory continuity and smoothness and increases surface coverage, with quantitative gains: Point-wise Chamfer Distance +98.2%, smoothness +97.0%, surface coverage +61% over prior methods, and demonstrates generalization to unseen shapes. Code is provided.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based trajectory generation offers a unified, end-to-end approach for industrial surface-processing tasks, eliminating the need for category-specific models and enabling better coverage and smoothness across varied tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

TL;DR: HumanoidExo introduces a human-to-humanoid motion transfer system that bridges embodiment gaps and enables large-scale whole-body humanoid datasets, improving real-robot policy learning with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting diverse, large-scale real-world data for humanoid robots is costly and difficult, creating an embodiment gap and limiting learning for whole-body control.

Method: A transfer pipeline that maps human motion to whole-body humanoid data (HumanoidExo), reducing the embodiment gap to enable efficient data collection and diverse demonstrations for real-robot policies.

Result: Empirical evidence across table-top manipulation, stand-squat integration, and whole-body manipulation shows improved generalization to novel environments, effective learning from as few as five real-robot demonstrations, and the ability to acquire new skills (e.g., walking) solely from HumanoidExo data.

Conclusion: HumanoidExo provides a crucial boost to real-robot data, enabling robust whole-body humanoid policy learning and expansion of capabilities in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) enable long-term human motion prediction (up to 60s) by encoding environmental motion patterns; a MoD-informed LHMP framework with a ranking output and a time-conditioned variant; surpasses learning-based baselines (up to 50% ADE improvement); code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term predictions are crucial for safe and efficient operation of autonomous robots/vehicles in human-shared spaces. Traditional learning-based methods may lag in leveraging environment motion patterns. MoDs offer a way to encode spatial/spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features to improve LHMP, and incorporating time-varying patterns (time-conditioned MoD) could capture diurnal or temporal variations in human motion.

Method: Proposes an MoD-informed LHMP framework that supports various MoD types and includes a ranking mechanism to output the most likely predicted trajectory. Introduces a time-conditioned MoD to capture motion patterns that vary by time of day. Evaluation uses three MoD types across two real-world datasets, comparing against learning-based baselines.

Result: The MoD-informed method outperforms learning-based approaches, achieving up to 50% improvement in average displacement error (ADE). The time-conditioned MoD variant attains the highest accuracy among the tested configurations.

Conclusion: MoD-based LHMP is effective for long-horizon prediction. Leveraging multiple MoD types and a time-conditioned MoD yields strong performance, with substantial gains over traditional learning-based methods. The work provides code for reproduction.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest
accuracy overall. Project code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current work mostly optimizes controllers for fixed structures; to achieve true embodied intelligence, robots must co-evolve both form and behavior under task- and resource-driven constraints, inspired by natural evolution.

Method: Proposes a practical co-design framework with three pillars: strategic exploration to navigate design and policy spaces, Sim2Real transfer to bridge simulation and real-world deployment, and meta-policy learning for adaptable policies across morphologies. Also analyzes the topic from methodological, application-driven, and community-oriented perspectives andList open research questions.

Result: Offers a conceptual, open-framework rather than empirical results; provides a structured approach, rationale, and roadmaps to advance co-design in humanoid robotics.

Conclusion: Co-design is positioned as essential for the next generation of intelligent, adaptable humanoid agents, with guidance and open questions to steer future research.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

### [178] [Whisker-based Tactile Flight for Tiny Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03119)
*Chaoxiang Ye,Guido de Croon,Salua Hamaza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tiny drone uses whisker-based tactile sensing to navigate by touch in darkness, with sub-6 mm tactile depth estimation on a 3.2 g onboard system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses sensing limits of tiny drones in poor-light, smoky, dusty, or reflective environments by enabling vision-free navigation through tactile perception inspired by whiskers.

Method: Developed a lightweight 3.2 g whisker-based tactile sensor using barometer-based whiskers to locate obstacles with minimal destabilization; introduces a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm accuracy; runs on a 192-KB RAM microcontroller for autonomous tactile flight; validated in simulation and real-world tests.

Result: Enables vision-free navigation, contouring of obstacles, and exploration of confined spaces solely by touch on both soft and rigid surfaces; demonstrates robustness to sensor noise and drift and works in total darkness; validated in both sim and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired tactile sensing redefines vision-free navigation for micro aerial vehicles, expanding capabilities in extreme environments and enabling safe operation where optical sensing fails.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

### [179] [Learning Stability Certificate for Robotics in Real-World Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03123)
*Zhe Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Data-driven stability certification: learns a Lyapunov function from trajectory data using a neural network with a Cholesky-based PD guarantee, allowing controlled violations to handle noise; enables model-free stability guarantees for autonomous systems and opaque controllers; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certifying stability for complex or unknown robotic systems is hard when dynamics are unknown or not accessible. A data-driven Lyapunov approach can provide safety guarantees without explicit system models or access to internal controllers.

Method: Parameterize a Lyapunov candidate V(x) with a neural network and enforce positive definiteness via Cholesky factorization. Train on trajectory data to certify stability of the autonomous system under the observed trajectories, while permitting bounded violations of the Lyapunov decrease condition to handle noise; the approach yields data-driven stability guarantees and does not require access to system internals.

Result: The framework delivers data-driven stability guarantees in dynamic, real-world environments, enabling safety certification for robotic systems without full dynamical models or knowledge of their control laws; it is robust to noise in data.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical, model-free route to stability certification for autonomous systems, expanding the applicability of Lyapunov-based guarantees to opaque or proprietary control settings and real-world deployments; the associated open-source tool enables broader adoption.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

### [180] [MM-Nav: Multi-View VLA Model for Robust Visual Navigation via Multi-Expert Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03142)
*Tianyu Xu,Jiawei Chen,Jiazhao Zhang,Wenyao Zhang,Zekun Qi,Minghan Li,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes MM-Nav, a multi-view Vision-Language-Action model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data via teacher-student RL, achieving strong generalization and outperforming teachers, with real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on explicit optical cues like depth/LiDAR; leverage VLA models and synthetic expert data to learn navigation from egocentric vision.

Method: Implement MM-Nav as a 360-view multi-view VLA model using pretrained LLMs and visual foundation models; collect expert data from three RL agents trained with privileged depth for reaching, squeezing, avoiding; train in teacher-student loop with online data and dynamic ratio balancing; test in synthetic environments and real-world.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization in synthetic environments; student VLA outperforms teacher RL agents; real-world experiments confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: Integrating multiple navigation capabilities within a VLA framework yields synergetic benefits and better generalization than individually trained teachers, validating VLA-based navigation with synthetic data.

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

### [181] [Optimal Smooth Coverage Trajectory Planning for Quadrotors in Cluttered Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03169)
*Duanjiao Li,Yun Chen,Ying Zhang,Junwen Yao,Dongyue Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage UAV trajectory planning for coverage in cluttered environments: (1) GA-based TSP to determine POI visiting order, (2) nonlinear least-squares trajectory optimization for smoothness, timing, and obstacle avoidance, yielding a smooth coverage path validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, safe, and smooth coverage of multiple POIs by UAVs in power-grid scenarios within cluttered environments, addressing challenges of non-smooth paths, time inefficiency, and collision risk.

Method: Stage 1: use a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem over Points of Interest to obtain an initial visiting sequence. Stage 2: refine the sequence by formulating a nonlinear least-squares optimization that accounts for trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance, producing a feasible smooth coverage trajectory.

Result: Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: A two-stage optimization framework (GA-based TSP followed by nonlinear least-squares trajectory optimization) yields smooth, feasible coverage trajectories under clutter and timing constraints, with simulation-level validation; real-world experiments and scalability considerations are potential future work.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

### [182] [Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03182)
*Yilun Hao,Yongchao Chen,Chuchu Fan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMFP is a dual-VLM framework that autonomously generates both PDDL problem and domain files for visual planning, using SimVLM to simulate consequences and GenVLM to iteratively refine PDDL by comparing with SimVLM, enabling generalization across instances and appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation that Vision-Language Models struggle to generate complete PDDL domain files, which previously required expert-crafted domains or external refinement; aims for end-to-end automated formal planning from visual inputs.

Method: Introduce two VLMs: SimVLM simulates action consequences from input rule descriptions; GenVLM generates and iteratively refines both PDDL domain and problem files by comparing PDDL execution with SimVLM results; evaluate on 6 grid-world domains and test generalization to unseen instances, appearances, and rules.

Result: SimVLM achieves high descriptive and simulation accuracy across seen/unseen appearances (describes ~95.5%/82.6% of scenarios, simulates ~85.5%/87.8% of action sequences, judges ~82.4%/85.6% goal-reaching). With SimVLM-guided guidance, VLMFP reaches 70.0% and 54.1% valid plans for unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

Conclusion: Dual-VLM guidance enables autonomous generation of robust PDDL domain/problem files for visual planning and improves planning success and generalization, though performance on unseen appearances lags behind seen ones, indicating room for refinement.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

### [183] [BrowserArena: Evaluating LLM Agents on Real-World Web Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02418)
*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Live open-web agent evaluation platform BrowserArena reveals three major failure modes (captcha, banners, direct URL nav) and model-dependent strategies, highlighting diversity and brittleness across LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks; a live, open-web evaluation is needed to surface real-world failure modes and variations across models.

Method: Collect user-submitted tasks, run Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and gather step-level human feedback to annotate agent traces; construct targeted datasets to study specific failure modes.

Result: Identified three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs; observed model-specific strategies (e.g., o4-mini using varied captcha workarounds; DeepSeek-R1 misleads about captcha). Demonstrates diversity and brittleness of current web agents and offers a scalable benchmarking approach.

Conclusion: A scalable benchmarking methodology for evaluating web-agent failure modes at scale, enabling systematic analysis of where and how current models fail on real open-web tasks.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RefineShot refines ShotBench and analyzes ShotVL to create a more reliable cinematography understanding benchmark, addressing ambiguous options and reasoning/instruction issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address evaluation reliability gaps in cinematography understanding benchmarks, ensure fair comparisons, and accelerate progress.

Method: Systematically restructure options in ShotBench; critically analyze ShotVL's reasoning; develop an extended evaluation protocol assessing accuracy and core competencies; produce RefineShot benchmark.

Result: RefineShot yields a refined and expanded benchmark enabling more reliable assessment and guiding future advances; initial findings include ShotVL's weaknesses in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence and an improved evaluation design.

Conclusion: RefineShot provides a more reliable, comprehensive benchmark for cinematography understanding, promoting fair evaluation and progress.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A distribution-free risk-control framework (DFRC) using dynamic early exit to limit harm from malicious in-context demonstrations in LLMs, while exploiting helpful demonstrations for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning opens vulnerability to incorrect or malicious demonstrations; need built-in safeguards instead of relying on human supervision.

Method: Define zero-shot baseline; apply DFRC to cap performance drop; use dynamic early exit predicting and ignoring attention heads most affected by unsafe inputs; modify DFRC to also harness helpful inputs for performance and efficiency; provide theoretical and empirical validation.

Result: Demonstrates ability to control risk from harmful demonstrations and achieve substantial efficiency gains for helpful demonstrations.

Conclusion: Offers principled design for robust in-context learning with built-in protections against attacks and improved efficiency; shows both theoretical guarantees and empirical support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

*Shuhao Fu,Esther Goldberg,Ying Nian Wu,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Identifies a small set of attention heads in OpenFlamingo-4B that carry spatial-relations representations, creates and manipulates function vectors to improve relational reasoning, enabling efficient fine-tuning and generalization to novel relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal how LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge and to enable targeted, data-efficient improvements by extracting and reusing internal modular components.

Method: Perform causal mediation analysis on synthetic and real image datasets to locate attention heads that influence relational predictions; extract multimodal function vectors from these heads; evaluate zero-shot improvements; fine-tune these vectors with limited data while freezing the base LMM; test linear combination of relation-specific vectors to solve analogies with novel relations.

Result: Extracted function vectors that boost zero-shot relational accuracy; modest-data fine-tuning with frozen LMM parameters outperforms in-context learning baselines; relation-specific vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogies involving untrained spatial relations, indicating strong generalization.

Conclusion: Relational knowledge in LMMs is localized within modular internal structures that can be extracted, manipulated, and optimized to improve relational reasoning and provide greater control over model behavior.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an Autonomous Manager Agent to orchestrate human–AI workflows, formalizes workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game, and provides MA-Gym for evaluation; experiments with GPT-5-based managers show current systems struggle to jointly optimize goals, constraints, and runtime, highlighting open governance and ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing need to manage complex, dynamic multi-agent workflows in human–AI teams. Existing agents handle individual tasks but fail at end-to-end orchestration, adaptability, and compliance across changing conditions and stakeholders.

Method: Propose the Autonomous Manager Agent architecture that decomposes goals into task graphs, allocates tasks to humans/AI, monitors progress, adapts to changes, and communicates with stakeholders. Formalize workflow management as a POSG. Identify four foundational challenges (compositional, multi-objective under shifting preferences, ad hoc team coordination, governance). Release MA-Gym as an open-source simulation/evaluation framework. Empirically evaluate GPT-5–based Manager Agents across 20 workflows.

Result: Manager agents struggled to optimize for three competing objectives—goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime—indicating that autonomous workflow management remains a difficult open problem.

Conclusion: Advances in autonomous, agentic workflow management require addressing core challenges in hierarchical reasoning, multi-objective optimization, dynamic coordination, and governance. The work highlights organizational and ethical implications of deploying such systems.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-enabled agentic systems autonomously accelerate additive manufacturing alloy discovery by dispatching tool calls (e.g., Thermo-Calc diagrams, lack-of-fusion process maps) and reasoning about printability, dynamically adjusting tasks based on tool outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and accelerate alloy discovery in AM, which requires cross-disciplinary expertise in materials science, thermodynamics, and experimental analysis, and enable autonomous decision-making in practical settings.

Method: A multi-agent system powered by LLMs uses a Model Context Protocol to issue tool calls (Thermo-Calc property diagrams, lack-of-fusion process maps) and reason over results. Agents interpret complex prompts, adjust their task trajectories based on tool outputs, and aim to automate alloy discovery in AM.

Result: The abstract claims the system can effectively reason about prompts, analyze alloy printability, and autonomously adapt task trajectories in response to tool-call results, thereby automating and accelerating alloy discovery.

Conclusion: LLM-enabled agentic systems can automate and accelerate alloy discovery in additive manufacturing and demonstrate the practicality and benefits of such multi-agent, tool-driven research workflows.

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Benchmarks five RL methods (DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, TRPO) on a CSPP Gym environment with crane scheduling; finds performance gaps as problem complexity increases; provides reusable benchmark framework for maritime logistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSPP is a critical but complex operation; prior RL work lacks systematic, reproducible comparisons; a standard Gym-based framework with crane scheduling enables fair benchmarking and practical deployment insights.

Method: Developed a CSPP Gym environment capturing core features; extended to crane scheduling; implemented single-agent and multi-agent formulations; evaluated five RL algorithms under scenarios of varying complexity; analyzed performance across scenarios.

Result: Identified distinct gaps in performance as complexity grows; algorithm choice and problem formulation materially affect CSPP outcomes; the environment is reusable, supporting future research and deployment.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmarked, reusable RL framework for CSPP with crane scheduling, laying groundwork for further research and potential practical adoption in maritime logistics.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Conclusion: LLMs are viable assistive tools in e-mobility; can enable scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning; further work on safety and interpretability.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [191] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models show cross-modal attention imbalance causing poor joint reasoning; a simple training approach that explicitly combines modalities mitigates this and boosts vision-language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand whether foundation models can perform joint cross-modal reasoning when evidence is distributed across modalities, including cross-lingual contexts, and why failures occur.

Method: Study cross-modal conflicts by evaluating FMs on scenarios where modalities disagree; analyze unimodal vs multimodal performance; measure cross-modal attention; test scaling datasets; propose explicit cross-modal combination per training instance.

Result: Unimodal conflict recognition ~90%; cross-modal conflicts as low as ~3%; attention scores highly asymmetric; scaling datasets blindly does not fix; explicit per-instance multimodal combination reduces imbalance; leads to improved performance on vision-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit cross-modal training cues are essential to reliable FMs; addressing attention imbalance improves cross-modal reasoning and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [192] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-temperature sampling expands the reach of test-time reasoning (TTS) beyond single-temperature limits, delivering about 7.3 points of gain over single-temperature TTS and rivaling RL-trained models, with a low-overhead multi-temperature voting method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-temperature TTS can stall gains at high K and may miss solving hard subproblems. Different temperatures address different subsets of problems, suggesting temperature as an additional scaling axis to unlock latent model potential.

Method: Evaluate across Qwen3 family (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) on five reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM). Compare single-temperature TTS to multi-temperature sampling and introduce a multi-temperature voting method to reduce overhead.

Result: Temperature scaling yields an average +7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Base models reach performance comparable to RL-trained counterparts without extra post-training. The multi-temperature voting method reduces the computational overhead of temperature scaling while preserving gains.

Conclusion: Temperature is a valuable new axis for scaling LLM reasoning. TTS is more powerful than previously thought when augmented with temperature scaling, and multi-temperature strategies can unlock latent model potential with manageable cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

about geology theses from the Central University of Ecuador. Our proposal uses
the Llama 3.1 and Gemini 2.5 language models, which are complemented by a

### [194] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a planning-oriented notion of possibility based on Łukasiewicz semantics, distinct from Zadeh's fuzzy possibility; models an event's feasibility from probabilities of prerequisites and constraints; includes a vehicle-route planning example and suggests broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an operational, real-world planning notion of possibility that captures feasibility and aligns with human planning reasoning, addressing limitations of standard fuzzy possibility.

Method: Define an event with prerequisites and constraints; compute its possibility as a function of the probabilities that prerequisites hold and constraints do not, using Łukasiewicz multivalent logic; apply to planning scenarios and rank plans by feasibility; illustrate with a vehicle route planning example.

Result: A theoretical framework for a feasibility-oriented notion of possibility, demonstrated via an illustrative vehicle routing example and discussion of how the approach can identify the most feasible plan; highlights potential for wider applications.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers a promising direction for planning and reasoning about feasibility; further development and applications are anticipated.

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

*Bo Ma,Hang Li,ZeHua Hu,XiaoFan Gui,LuYao Liu,Simon Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMaAS is a self-evolving, NAS-inspired framework that automatically discovers and manages LLM-based multi-agent architectures with dynamic operator lifecycles to optimize performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated MAS designs rely on monolithic, static architectures that fail to adapt resource usage to varying query complexity and domain requirements; there is a need for resource-aware, adaptable, and interpretable multi-agent design.

Method: Four innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based on performance-cost analysis; (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with real-time parameter adjustment; (3) online feedback integration for continuous architecture refinement; (4) interpretability via decision tracing. The approach applies neural-architecture-search (NAS) principles to automatically discover optimal agent configurations and operator lifecycles within LLM-powered MAS, with online feedback loops and real-time adaptation across different datasets and backbones.

Result: Across six benchmarks, AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1% performance gains while reducing inference costs by 3-5% compared to state-of-the-art methods; shows strong transferability across datasets and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: AutoMaAS introduces a new paradigm for automated MAS design in the LLM era by enabling dynamic, cost-aware, and interpretable self-evolving architectures that improve performance and reduce costs, with broad transferability.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

### [196] [ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02677)
*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs provides an adaptive, scalable red-teaming framework for vision-language models that autonomously uncovers vulnerabilities, introduces 11 multimodal attack strategies and 17 algorithms, builds ARMs-Bench with 30k+ instances, and enhances safety through targeted fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM safety evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of multimodal vulnerabilities and reliance on manual or narrow red-teaming approaches. A scalable, automated framework is needed to systematically identify real-world risks and guide robust safety alignment.

Method: Propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that optimizes diverse red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration to elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. Introduce 11 multimodal attack strategies (e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking) and integrate 17 red-teaming algorithms via a model context protocol (MCP). Employ a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy exploration to balance diversity and effectiveness. Evaluate on instance- and policy-based benchmarks and construct ARMs-Bench with over 30k red-teaming instances across 51 risk categories.

Result: ARMs achieves state-of-the-art attack success across benchmarks, exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. It yields substantially more diverse red-teaming instances and reveals emerging vulnerabilities. ARMs-Bench enables large-scale safety evaluation, and safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench significantly improves VLM robustness while preserving utility.

Conclusion: ARMs enables scalable, diverse, and effective risk assessment for VLMs, guiding safety alignment against evolving multimodal threats. The ARMs-Bench dataset supports systematic safety improvements and provides actionable guidance for robust multimodal safety interventions.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

### [197] [Automated Constraint Specification for Job Scheduling by Regulating Generative Model with Domain-Specific Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02679)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Qiao Xu,Yanjia Li,Mingchen Liu,Huamin Qu,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A three-level, constraint-centric architecture guides LLMs to reliably specify production constraints for APS, combining hierarchical domain-specific representations with an automated adaptation algorithm to balance generative ability and reliability, outperforming pure LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturing scheduling requires formal constraints; manual constraint specification is labor-intensive. While LLMs can automate, their outputs are ambiguous and non-deterministic, and domain knowledge is often missing. A structured constraint-centric approach can improve reliability.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical structural space across three levels implemented with domain-specific representations to ensure precision and reliability while keeping flexibility, along with an automated production scenario adaptation algorithm to customize the architecture for specific manufacturing configurations.

Result: Experimental results indicate the approach improves reliability and precision in constraint specification and significantly outperforms pure LLM-based methods in constraint generation tasks.

Conclusion: The architecture enables reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling by regulating LLMs, achieving precision without sacrificing flexibility, and demonstrating practical viability.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

*Yulong Zhang,Li Wang,Wei Du,Peilin Li,Yuqin Dai Zhiyuan Zhao,Lingyong Fang,Ziniu Liu,Ru Zhang,Huijia Zhu,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV) is a training-free framework that converts chain-of-thought verification into lightweight node-level binary checks, enabling precise error localization, improved interpretability, and large token savings with 10-25% F1 gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifying multi-step reasoning in LLMs is hard due to imprecise error localization and high token costs. Whole-chain verification dilutes attention and often requires expensive sampling.

Method: Decompose the reasoning chain into interconnected verification nodes and perform binary consistency checks at each node. No training required; avoids long-form generation; reduces token usage.

Result: On public datasets, NCV achieves 10-25% improvement in F1 over baselines and uses 6x to 58x fewer tokens than CoT-based verifiers.

Conclusion: NCV provides a scalable, interpretable, and efficient verification framework for reliable LLM reasoning without training.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE framework for multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents; uses an evidence bank to assess reasoning trajectories; introduces a meta-evaluation dataset with flawed trajectories; scalable and effective even with small open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate multi-step agent reasoning beyond final answers. Ground-truth trajectory annotation is expensive; simple answer-based or single-metric evaluation misses efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity aspects.

Method: Introduce TRACE framework with an evidence bank to accumulate knowledge from prior reasoning steps and enable multi-faceted trajectory analysis. Create a meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting benchmarks with diverse, flawed trajectories, labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Validate on small open-source LLMs and apply to tool-augmented tasks.

Result: TRACE provides accurate, scalable, and cost-effective evaluation of complex trajectories; effective even with small LLMs; reveals previously unreported insights into agent reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a practical framework for diagnosing and benchmarking tool-augmented LLM agents by analyzing their reasoning trajectories, not just final answers, enabling richer insights and scalable evaluation.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA) is invalid in practice: approximation, estimation, and optimization errors cause systematic deviations from any objective, and perfectly translating intent to a formal objective is impossible, making misspecification inevitable. Under strong optimization, Goodhart-like failures are likely, so a principled limit on optimizing General-Purpose AI is necessary to avoid irreversible loss of control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common belief that training yields models that satisfy their stated objective and to show that practical factors (errors, misalignment, and misspecification) cause persistent deviations, potentially under Goodhart’s law, thereby risking loss of control in advanced AI systems.

Method: A learning-paradigm-agnostic theoretical framework that aggregates approximation, estimation, and optimization errors, along with alignment/misspecification concerns, and connects them to recent mathematical results on Goodhart-like failure modes to argue about irreducible gaps and indistinguishability from Goodhart under optimization pressure.

Result: The paper argues that OSA fails even with well-specified objectives due to technical and philosophy-level gaps; the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located in advance, leading to systematic deviations and potential loss of control as optimization grows.

Conclusion: A principled limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary; without such limits, continued optimization is liable to produce predictable, irreversible loss of control.

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

### [201] [Reward Model Routing in Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02850)
*Xinle Wu,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianRouter is a two-stage RM routing framework for RLHF/RLAIF that learns offline per-RM reliability and uses online Bayesian Thompson sampling to select RMs per query, yielding better alignment across instruction-following and reasoning tasks with fewer RM calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single reward models (RM) in RLHF/RLAIF limit alignment quality and risk overfitting. RM routing can exploit complementary strengths but suffers from cold-start and exploration issues. A hybrid offline-online approach promises robust, low-cost RM selection.

Method: Offline stage: train a multi-task router on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability. Online stage: deploy a Bayesian Thompson sampling router that selects an RM per query, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and updating posteriors with online rewards to adapt to evolving policy distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments on instruction-following benchmarks (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU) show BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: BayesianRouter effectively combines offline strengths with online Bayesian adaptation to robustly route RM calls, addressing cold-start and exploration challenges and generalizing across instruction-following and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

TL;DR: MaskGRPO enables scalable multimodal RL in discrete diffusion by introducing an importance estimator and modality-specific rollout, yielding stable updates and improved generation quality; first practical discretized visual diffusion method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models for multimodal generation face intractable importance sampling and complex rollouts in reinforcement learning, hindering scalable optimization.

Method: Develop a theoretical foundation for discrete diffusion models, build an importance estimator that captures token fluctuations for gradient updates, and tailor the rollout method for visual sequences to produce diverse completions and reliable gradients, supported by math reasoning, coding, and visual benchmarks.

Result: More stable and efficient updates, stronger reasoning, and improved generation quality; positions MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical method for discretized visual diffusion.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO is the first viable, scalable multimodal reinforcement learning approach for discrete diffusion, establishing a practical policy optimization framework for discretized visual diffusion.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: XAI explanations encode ontological/epistemological assumptions; small methodological choices can shift what counts as an explanation; ignoring these paradigm choices risks misinterpretation across domains; paper advocates domain-aware selection and adaptation of XAI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reveal how underlying philosophical assumptions shape explanations and their trustworthiness, and provide practical guidance for applying XAI across domains.

Method: Philosophical and conceptual analysis of explainability methods; examines how methods embed assumptions about the existence and knowability of explanations; analyzes how minor technical changes affect these assumptions; discusses domain applicability and guidance.

Result: Shows that seemingly minor technical tweaks in XAI methods can correspond to significant shifts in underlying explanatory assumptions; identifies risks of misalignment between method and domain; offers recommendations for selecting and adapting XAI methods to fit domain onto-epistemic contexts.

Conclusion: Integrate onto-epistemological considerations into XAI design; provide a framework and guidelines for domain-specific selection and adaptation of explanatory methods to ensure valid and useful AI explanations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

*Anna Trapp,Mersedeh Sadeghi,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces formal counterfactual explanations for rule-based smart environments, implemented as a plugin to an existing explainer; evaluates via user study showing context-dependent preferences between causal and counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability is crucial in rule-based smart environments; there is a gap for counterfactual explanations in XAI tailored to these domains; need guidance on when such explanations are most effective.

Method: Formalize counterfactual explanations for the domain and implement them as a plugin extending an existing explanation engine; conduct a user study (N=17) comparing counterfactuals to traditional causal explanations.

Result: Explanations are preferred in a context-dependent way: causal explanations favored for linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured scenarios; counterfactuals favored for actionable content when users seek to resolve a problem; provides empirical evidence on when to use each type.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for counterfactual explanations in rule-based smart environments and empirical guidance on selecting the most effective explanation type depending on user goals and context.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

### [205] [A Study of Rule Omission in Raven's Progressive Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03127)
*Binze Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformers and vision-based RPM models excel on familiar rules but fail to generalize when structural rules are omitted; a gap between token-level accuracy and full-answer accuracy reveals reasoning limitations; architectures need to move beyond pattern recognition for robust abstract reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether AI performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices reflects genuine abstract reasoning or reliance on statistical shortcuts, by testing generalization under incomplete training where several structural rules are withheld, using the I-RAVEN dataset.

Method: Evaluate sequence-to-sequence transformers and vision-based models (CoPINet, Dual-Contrast Network) on the I-RAVEN dataset under training conditions that omit some structural rules; compare performance on familiar vs novel/omitted rules; analyze token-level vs complete-answer accuracy to assess underlying reasoning.

Result: Models perform well on rules seen during training but show sharp degradation on novel or omitted rules; notably, token-level accuracy does not reliably predict complete answer accuracy, highlighting a fundamental gap between surface pattern recognition and true abstract reasoning.

Conclusion: Current AI approaches largely rely on pattern recognition with limited generalization to unseen structural rules; there is a need for architectures and mechanisms that support robust abstract reasoning beyond training-time shortcuts.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

TL;DR: Prompt optimization for LLM-driven collaborative embodied agents (CoELA) boosts collaboration efficiency; adding voice interaction enhances UX; best setup with Gemma3 yields ~22% efficiency gain over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multi-agent collaboration and decision-making in shared virtual spaces by leveraging LLM prompting and prompt engineering, and to extend CoELA with speech for natural, collaborative interaction.

Method: Systematic experiments across multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimal combinations for collaboration; integration of speech capabilities; evaluation against a baseline CoELA configuration, using Gemma3 as a platform.

Result: Prompt optimization significantly improves collaborative performance; the best configuration achieved a 22% efficiency gain over the original CoELA system on Gemma3; speech integration provides a more engaging interface that supports iterative development and demonstrations.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering is an effective lever for boosting collaborative agent performance in LLM-enabled multi-agent systems; adding speech-capable interfaces further enhances user engagement and practical demonstrations, validating CoELA’s extended framework.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoDA reframes data-visualization automation as a collaborative multi-agent system using specialized LLMs for metadata analysis, planning, code generation, and self-reflection, yielding large performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate visualization from natural language for complex, multi-file datasets where current tools struggle with data complexity, token limits, and robustness; aim to integrate agentic workflows rather than rely on single-step parsing.

Method: Introduce CoDA, a multi-agent pipeline with dedicated LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection; formalize the pipeline; leverage metadata analysis to mitigate token limits and a quality-driven refinement loop for robustness.

Result: Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%.

Conclusion: Future visualization automation lies in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows rather than isolated code-generation approaches.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

### [208] [Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03206)
*Cai Zhou,Chenxiao Yang,Yi Hu,Chenyu Wang,Chubin Zhang,Muhan Zhang,Lester Mackey,Tommi Jaakkola,Stephen Bates,Dinghuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CCDD jointly diffuses continuous latent representations and discrete tokens to combine expressivity with trainable decoding, delivering strong language-modeling results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between the expressivity of continuous diffusion and the empirical performance of discrete diffusion with looped transformers. Continuous models offer rich latent semantics but face decoding difficulties to discrete tokens; discrete models are trainable but may lack latent expressivity. The paper seeks a unified framework that preserves the advantages of both paradigms.

Method: Introduce Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD): a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, implemented with a single model that denoises in the joint space. Develop architectures and training/sampling techniques to integrate continuous latent diffusion with discrete token diffusion, enabling simultaneous denoising and coherent generation across modalities.

Result: Extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks show strong empirical performance, indicating that the joint continuous-discrete diffusion framework achieves high sample quality and training efficiency, outperforming baselines that use purely continuous or purely discrete diffusion or looped transformer approaches.

Conclusion: CCDD provides a principled, effective fusion of continuous latent diffusion and discrete token diffusion, achieving expressive latent semantics together with practical trainability and sample quality. This supports continuous-discrete diffusion as a viable paradigm for language modeling and invites further exploration of architectural and training strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
