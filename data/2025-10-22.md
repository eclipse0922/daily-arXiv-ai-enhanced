### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic, multi-agent training framework (MAT-Agent) uses non-stationary multi-armed bandits to adaptively tune augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions for multi-label image classification, achieving faster convergence and stronger performance with robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static training configurations struggle in dynamic visual-semantic landscapes, failing to adapt to evolving data distributions and rare-class requirements. Adaptive training strategies are needed to balance exploration of hyperparameters with stable convergence.

Method: Deploy autonomous agents that dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss functions. Use non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward combining accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhance with dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training to improve robustness and efficiency.

Result: On Pascal VOC, MAT-Agent achieves mAP 97.4 (vs 96.2 PAT-T); OF1 92.3; CF1 91.4. On COCO, mAP 92.8 (vs 92.0 HSQ-CvN); OF1 88.2; CF1 87.1. On VG-256, mAP 60.9; OF1 70.8; CF1 61.1. Demonstrates accelerated convergence and robust cross-domain generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: MAT-Agent offers a scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, outperforming baselines and enabling adaptive deep learning with improved convergence, robustness, and generalization.

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO is a dual-objective data selection framework for multimodal LLMs that jointly optimizes data importance and diversity using a lightweight plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample. It applies a homoscedastic uncertainty-based balancing to select a 20% subset from the full dataset for instruction tuning, achieving 98.2% of full-data performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B across ten tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large multimodal models with large-scale data is computationally expensive. Existing selection methods are costly and often treat importance and diversity separately, leading to inefficiencies. There is a need for a scalable, joint optimization of importance and diversity to reduce data and compute requirements.

Method: Introduce CoIDO, a dual-objective framework with a plug-in scorer trained on a small random sample to learn the distribution of candidate data. Use a homoscedastic uncertainty-based formulation to balance data importance and diversity during selection. After training the scorer on 20% of random data, apply it to the full dataset to select 20% as the tuning subset.

Result: The selected 20% subset achieves 98.2% of the performance of full-data fine-tuning on average across the LLaVA-1.5-7B model and ten downstream tasks.

Conclusion: CoIDO offers a scalable, efficient approach to data selection for instruction tuning in multimodal LLMs by jointly optimizing for importance and diversity, dramatically reducing computation while preserving near-full performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conditional latent diffusion model predicts post-treatment GBM MRI from pre-treatment MRI and tumor localization, guided by survival data, trained on a 140-patient local dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of treatment response in glioblastoma is crucial for personalized medicine due to heterogeneous responses and delayed visual signs; conventional TRP relies on time-series data, whereas image-to-image translation could provide early, visualized progression insights.

Method: A Latent Diffusion Model conditioned on pre-treatment MRI and manual tumor localization with concatenation-based conditioning; classifier-free guidance using survival information to steer generation toward realistic post-treatment tumor evolution; trained and tested on a local dataset of 140 GBM patients with pre/post T1-Gd MRI and survival data.

Result: Not reported in the abstract; no quantitative or qualitative results are provided.

Conclusion: The approach is a promising direction for early visual TRP in GBM, but lacks results and external validation in the abstract; success hinges on accurate localization and generalizability across centers.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Embedding-based detector uses image embeddings and vector similarity to separate AI-generated images from human-created ones, validated across five embedding models; robust to perturbations and computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI produces increasingly realistic content, verifying authenticity and provenance of digital images is essential for trust, integrity, and legality in digital media.

Method: Proposes an embedding-based AI image detection framework. The method computes image embeddings and uses vector similarity to assess whether an image clusters with AI-generated content or with human-created content. The hypothesis is that AI-generated images cluster with AI content in embedding space, while human-created images cluster within their domain. The system processes a diverse dataset of AI- and human-generated images through five benchmark embedding models, evaluating robustness to perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate robustness of the approach. Moderate to high perturbations have minimal impact on embedding signatures, with perturbed images maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. The approach is generalizable and balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides a generalizable, efficient solution for detecting AI-generated images, capable of accurate classification across embedding models and resilient to perturbations.

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded multi-scale normalization approach for backchannel detection (CMIS-Net) that removes individual baselines at frame and sequence levels and uses implicit data augmentation to handle distribution bias, achieving state-of-the-art backchannel agreement detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backchannel cues vary across individuals and across time scales; current emotion recognition methods miss multi-scale normalization and fail to address data distribution biases; improving cross-person generalization is needed.

Method: Introduce CMIS-Net with cascaded multi-scale individual standardization to normalize backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines at frame and sequence levels; include an implicit data augmentation module to mitigate training distribution bias.

Result: Experiments and visualizations show improved handling of individual differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: Multi-scale normalization combined with data augmentation enhances cross-person generalization in backchannel detection; CMIS-Net advances human-like responsive AI in interactive settings.

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra-efficient post-training shortcutting for flow-matching diffusion models via velocity-field self-distillation, enabling few-step samplers without step-size embeddings and allowing rapid, even few-shot distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational burden of shortcut models in flow matching diffusion, which previously required specialized step-size embeddings or retraining from scratch; enable fast, few-step samplers and data-efficient distillation for very large diffusion models.

Method: Introduce a velocity-field self-distillation mechanism operating in velocity space, enabling aggressive shortcutting online without step-size embeddings; works during or even before pretraining to yield efficient few-step flows.

Result: Achieves (e.g.) a 3-step Flux sampler in under a single A100 day; demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with very small data (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter models via few-shot distillation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach delivers efficient, high-quality few-step diffusion flows, can be integrated into pretraining to produce models inherently capable of fast sampling, and enables near-free few-shot distillation for extremely large models.

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

### [7] [Robotic Classification of Divers' Swimming States using Visual Pose Keypoints as IMUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17863)
*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-to-pseudo-IMU approach enabling onboard AUV-based anomaly detection for scuba divers, addressing underwater signal attenuation and improving safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater HAR is hindered by poor image cues and especially by wireless signal attenuation from diver-worn sensors; there is a need for reliable, non-invasive diver monitoring to detect emergencies.

Method: Use computer vision to extract 3D human joint keypoints from video to generate a high-fidelity pseudo-IMU data stream; train and deploy a classifier onboard an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to identify anomalous diver behaviors indicating distress; validate with simulated distress scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the hybrid CV-derived pseudo-IMU approach for robotic monitoring and diver safety in underwater environments through simulated emergencies.

Conclusion: A vision-based pseudo-IMU pipeline can circumvent underwater wireless limitations and enable real-time onboard anomaly detection for diver safety, with potential applicability to broader underwater robotic monitoring.

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

### [8] [InsideOut: Integrated RGB-Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Comprehensive 3D Object Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17864)
*Jungmin Lee,Seonghyuk Hong,Juyong Lee,Jaeyoon Lee,Jongwon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InsideOut extends 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) to fuse RGB surface details with subsurface X-ray structures via hierarchical RGB-X-ray alignment and an X-ray reference loss, enabling cross-modality fusion with limited paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface textures and subsurface X-ray information, enabling accurate visualization and analysis across medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing; address disparate data representations and scarcity of paired RGB-X-ray data.

Method: Extend 3DGS to include X-ray radiative Gaussian splats; collect new paired RGB and X-ray data; perform hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray splats; introduce an X-ray reference loss to enforce structural consistency across modalities.

Result: Facilitates cross-modality fusion of RGB and X-ray data, improving visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing; broadens the applicability of 3DGS to domains requiring internal structure awareness.

Conclusion: InsideOut successfully bridges RGB and X-ray representations within 3DGS, mitigating modality gaps and data scarcity, and expanding the utility of 3D surface–volume fusion for diverse applications.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

### [9] [MUSE: Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity Estimation for zero-shot 2D Object Detection and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17866)
*Sungmin Cho,Sungbum Park,Insoo Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE is a training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation that matches 2D image proposals to 3D unseen object templates using an uncertainty-aware, jointly calibrated similarity metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust zero-shot 2D detection/segmentation without task-specific training by leveraging 3D object views and 2D proposals, reducing the need for labeled data and fine-tuning.

Method: Embedding stage fuses class and patch embeddings with GeM-normalized patch embeddings to capture global and local features. Matching stage uses a joint absolute/relative similarity metric between 2D proposals and 3D templates, refined by an uncertainty-aware object prior that accounts for proposal reliability. No additional training or fine-tuning is required.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across Classic Core, H3, and Industrial tracks.

Conclusion: MUSE offers a powerful, generalizable, training-free framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and segmentation, with robust matching and uncertainty-aware refinement.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

*Gerard Asbert,Pau Torras,Lei Kang,Alicia Fornés,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN-based pipeline generates realistic handwritten-looking music symbols, which are assembled into full scores with Smashcima, addressing data scarcity in OMR by synthetic data; visual fidelity of generated symbols is high.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMR suffers from lack of real annotated handwritten data, especially historical scores. In related fields like Handwritten Text Recognition, synthetic data via image generation improves recognition. The study aims to produce realistic handwritten symbols and assemble them into complete scores to support OMR training.

Method: Train a music symbol-level Generative Adversarial Network to create realistic music symbols. Assemble generated symbols into full scores using Smashcima engraving software to produce complete synthetic scores. Systematically evaluate visual fidelity of generated samples.

Result: The generated symbols exhibit a high degree of realism according to a structured visual fidelity evaluation, indicating significant progress in synthetic score generation.

Conclusion: Symbol-level GANs combined with engraving tools can yield realistic synthetic scores, potentially mitigating annotated data scarcity for OMR and enabling improved training of recognition systems; further work could validate impact on recognition performance and refine fidelity.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

### [11] [Auditing and Mitigating Bias in Gender Classification Algorithms: A Data-Centric Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17873)
*Tadesse K Bahiru,Natnael Tilahun Sinshaw,Teshager Hailemariam Moges,Dheeraj Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BalancedFace addresses data bias in gender classification by creating a dataset that equalizes 189 intersectional subgroups (age, race, gender) using only real images, resulting in substantial fairness improvements with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate data-induced biases in gender classification stemming from demographic imbalances in training data and to provide a fairer resource for research.

Method: Audit five widely used gender datasets to assess underrepresentation. Train identical MobileNetV2 models on UTKFace and FairFace. Create BalancedFace by blending images from FairFace, UTKFace, and additional sources to equalize subgroup shares across 189 age-race-gender intersections using real images. Train a standard classifier on BalancedFace and evaluate fairness metrics.

Result: Even the best-balanced datasets exhibit bias (e.g., higher misclassification for females, amplified racial skew). Training on BalancedFace reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by >50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, with minimal loss in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Data-centric intervention—balancing the training data across a large set of intersectional subgroups—substantially improves fairness in gender classification and provides a valuable public resource for research, without severely sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

### [12] [3D Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Class-Aware and Geometry-Guided Pseudo-Label Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17875)
*Xiaoxu Xu,Xuexun Liu,Jinlong Li,Yitian Yuan,Qiudan Zhang,Lin Ma,Nicu Sebe,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that uses 3D geometric priors and class-aware refinement with self-training to produce high-fidelity pseudo labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on ScanNet and S3DIS and strong unsupervised generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D WSSS suffers from (i) low-quality pseudo-labels due to limited supervision and (ii) underutilization of 3D geometric structure. There is a need for a method that simultaneously refines pseudo labels by category and enforces geometric plausibility, while expanding label coverage through self-training.

Method: A two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Class-Aware Label Refinement to generate balanced, category-specific pseudo labels; (2) Geometry-Aware Label Refinement that enforces implicit 3D geometric constraints to filter out low-confidence labels. Additionally, a Label Update strategy via Self-Training propagates labels into unlabeled regions, iteratively improving label quality and coverage.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D geometric priors with class-aware refinement and self-training yields high-quality pseudo labels and broader coverage, enabling superior 3D WSSS performance.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

*Ghazal Danaee,Marc Niethammer,Jarrett Rushmore,Sylvain Bouix*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative fairness analysis of nucleus accumbens MRI segmentation across race/sex using UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr, and ANTs; race-matched training improves some models; nnU-Net is robust to demographics; sex effects appear in volumes; race effects largely vanish in biased models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess fairness and demographic bias in medical image segmentation, focusing on race and sex effects on segmentation accuracy and derived nucleus accumbens (NAc) volumes.

Method: Dataset with four demographic subgroups (black female, black male, white female, white male). Gold-standard manual segmentations. Models evaluated: UNesT, nnU-Net, CoTr, and atlas-based ANTs. Two analyses: (1) segmentation accuracy across groups using a fairness metric, and (2) derived NAc volumes to assess race/sex effects and interactions. Linear mixed models examine effects of race, sex, and their interaction on accuracy and volumes. Training/testing included race-matched evaluations.

Result: Race-matched training leads to significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show notable improvements when trained and tested on race-matched data, whereas nnU-Net demonstrates robust performance independent of demographic matching. Sex effects observed with manual segmentation are also seen with biased models, while race effects disappear in all but one model.

Conclusion: Model bias in segmentation is model-dependent; race-matched training can mitigate bias for some methods, while others remain robust to demographic variation. Sex-related volume effects persist in manual and biased segmentations; race effects largely vanish for most models. The findings underscore the need for fairness-aware training and evaluation in medical image segmentation to ensure unbiased volumetric analyses.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

*Kazuki Kawamura,Kengo Nakai,Jun Rekimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ManzaiSet is a large multimodal dataset of viewer responses to Japanese manzai, addressing Western-centric bias in affective computing by capturing facial videos and audio from 241 participants across up to 10 performances; analyses reveal three viewer types, a positive viewing order effect, and no type-wise differences in automated humor labels after correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address Western-centric bias in affective computing by collecting culturally grounded, non-Western data to enable emotionally aware AI and personalized entertainment systems in non-Western contexts.

Method: Multimodal data collection (facial videos and audio) from 241 participants watching up to 10 professional manzai performances in randomized order. Analyses include k-means clustering to identify viewer types, Brown-Forsythe test for variance heterogeneity, individual-level linear trend to assess order effects (slope), humorous-content labeling (77 instances, 131 labels) and viewer-level response modeling with false discovery rate (FDR) correction.

Result: Identified three viewer types: High and Stable Appreciators (72.8%, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2%, n=30), Variable Improvers (14.0%, n=32); heterogeneous variance across groups (Brown-Forsythe p<0.001). Found a positive viewing order effect (mean slope 0.488, t(227)=5.42, p<0.001; permutation p<0.001), counter to fatigue theories. Automated humor classification and modeling yielded no type-wise differences after FDR correction.

Conclusion: ManzaiSet enables culturally aware emotion AI and personalized entertainment systems tailored to non-Western contexts, addressing a gap in affective computing and enabling more inclusive, context-specific models of humor appreciation.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing

### [16] [SAVANT: Semantic Analysis with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18034)
*Roberto Brusnicki,David Pop,Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVANT uses a structured, four-layer, two-phase analysis to detect driving anomalies from images, yielding high recall/accuracy and enabling local deployment with a 7B open-source model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems are vulnerable to long-tail, rare, out-of-distribution scenarios and semantic anomalies. Relying on unstructured VLM prompting risks unreliable performance and dependence on proprietary models. A structured, open, and deployable approach is needed for reliable semantic anomaly detection.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: (1) structured scene description extraction across four semantic layers (Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, Environment); (2) multi-modal evaluation leveraging Vision-Language Models for reasoning within that structure. Demonstrations include fine-tuning a 7B open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) on labeled data.

Result: On real-world driving scenarios, SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy. The open-source 7B model Qwen2.5VL, when fine-tuned within SAVANT, reaches 90.8% recall and 93.8% accuracy, outperforming all models evaluated. The approach automatically labeled over 9,640 real-world images with high accuracy.

Conclusion: Structured scene analysis with a two-phase, multi-modal evaluation improves anomaly detection performance, reduces dependence on proprietary models, enables local deployment at near-zero cost, and helps address data scarcity by producing a sizable labeled dataset for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

### [17] [TriggerNet: A Novel Explainable AI Framework for Red Palm Mite Detection and Multi-Model Comparison and Heuristic-Guided Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18038)
*Harshini Suresha,Kavitha SH*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study introduces TriggerNet, an interpretable AI framework that fuses Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to classify plant health and detect red palm mite infestation across 11 plant species, comparing multiple DL architectures and traditional ML classifiers, with Snorkel-based weak labeling to expedite disease-class annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestations threaten palm cultivation by reducing yield and quality. Early, accurate, and interpretable identification of infested plants is essential for effective management, but existing methods may lack transparency and scalability.

Method: Train and evaluate a range of models (CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, InceptionV3) for plant species classification and disease classification into Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish Bronzing, Silk Webbing. Use Random Forest, SVM, KNN for additional ML-based classification. Apply TriggerNet to generate visual explanations by integrating Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV. Employ Snorkel to efficiently label disease classes via heuristic rules to reduce manual annotation effort. Dataset comprises RGB images over 11 plant species: Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise, Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree, Cast Iron Plant.

Result: The study demonstrates the feasibility of combining multiple explainability techniques into a single interpretable framework (TriggerNet) to support plant classification and disease detection, with a labeling-efficiency gain from Snorkel. A broad empirical comparison across several DL architectures and traditional ML classifiers was conducted on a diverse, multi-species image set.

Conclusion: Integrating interpretable AI (TriggerNet) with diverse model families can enhance early detection of mite infestation and provide transparent rationale for classifications, suggesting promise for scalable, explainable plant-health monitoring. Future work should include quantitative ablation, external validation, and user-driven evaluation of the explanations.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

### [18] [HouseTour: A Virtual Real Estate A(I)gent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18054)
*Ata Çelen,Marc Pollefeys,Daniel Barath,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseTour presents a diffusion-based method to generate spatially coherent 3D camera trajectories and 3D-grounded natural language summaries from image collections, using 3D Gaussian splatting for novel views, supported by a dataset of 1,200+ house-tour videos. Jointly modeling trajectory and text improves performance over handling tasks separately, enabling automated, professional real estate/tourism video creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with geometric reasoning; real estate and tourism videos require coherent 3D understanding and smooth camera motion. A joint framework that grounds descriptions in 3D trajectories can produce more accurate, actionable summaries and compelling visuals without specialized equipment.

Method: A diffusion-based process constrained by known camera poses to generate smooth 3D trajectories, integrated into a vision-language model to produce 3D-grounded descriptions; 3D Gaussian splatting renders novel views along the trajectory to synthesize final video; introduces HouseTour dataset with 1,200+ videos, camera poses, 3D reconstructions, and real estate descriptions; evaluates both isolated tasks and end-to-end performance using a new joint metric.

Result: Incorporating 3D camera trajectories into text generation yields better performance than treating trajectory estimation and captioning as separate steps; the end-to-end approach with a joint metric demonstrates improved quality for generated videos and descriptions; the HouseTour dataset facilitates this line of research and practical applications show potential for automated real estate/tourism video creation.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables automated, professional-quality 3D-aware video creation from image collections without specialized equipment, by tightly coupling 3D trajectory generation with 3D-grounded text generation; the joint metric and dataset support broader evaluation and adoption in real estate and tourism tasks.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

*Shivam Singh,Yiming Chen,Agneet Chatterjee,Amit Raj,James Hays,Yezhou Yang,Chitra Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chimera is a personalized image generation model that composes novel objects by combining specified parts from multiple source images guided by text, using a semantic-atom dataset and a diffusion prior, and a new PartEval metric showing improvements in part alignment, compositional accuracy, and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized generative models lack explicit, mask-free control to assemble objects from parts of different images based on textual instructions; there is a need for controllable and evaluable compositional synthesis without manual annotations.

Method: Construct a taxonomy of semantic atoms (part, subject) totaling 464 unique pairs; generate 37k prompts and synthesize corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model; train a diffusion prior with part-conditional guidance to enforce semantic identity and spatial layout; introduce PartEval as an objective metric for fidelity and compositional accuracy.

Result: Human evaluations and PartEval show Chimera outperforms baselines by ~14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and ~21% in visual quality.

Conclusion: Chimera enables targeted object synthesis by assembling parts from different images via text instructions, introduces PartEval for objective evaluation, and demonstrates improved compositional control in personalized image generation.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

*Paul-Tiberiu Miclea,Martin Sboron,Hardik Vaghasiya,Hoang Thinh Nguyen,Meet Gadara,Thomas Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML-based detection of microplastics in SEM images shows promise but varies across YOLO models and is limited by scarce expert-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants; detecting, classifying, and removing MPs is challenging due to their small size. Automated ML approaches offer scalability for large screening studies, but data labeling and model generalization remain bottlenecks.

Method: Exploratory study combining SEM imaging with ML-based object detection, focusing on a filtration scenario with symmetric, repetitive backgrounds. It assesses differences between YOLO models and the impact of preprocessing, highlighting data-labeling constraints.

Result: The study observed differences in the performance of YOLO models for MP detection and demonstrated that preprocessing optimization is relevant. A major open challenge identified is the limited amount of expert-labeled data required for reliable training of ML models.

Conclusion: ML-assisted MP detection via SEM and object detection is feasible and promising, but its effectiveness is currently constrained by data scarcity and variability in model performance. Future work should address data collection/labeling, preprocessing strategies, and model robustness across diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

*Rohan Choudhury,JungEun Kim,Jinhyung Park,Eunho Yang,László A. Jeni,Kris M. Kitani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT introduces adaptive patch sizes within an image to reduce ViT token count, achieving substantial speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs for high-resolution images suffer from long input sequences due to uniformly partitioned patches; reducing tokens without sacrificing accuracy is desirable.

Method: Use multiple patch sizes per image, assigning larger patches to homogeneous regions and smaller patches to complex areas; can be applied to already fine-tuned ViTs and may converge in about 1 epoch.

Result: Throughput increases ~40% for ViT-L and ~50% for ViT-H; dense visual tasks show up to 30% faster training/inference; performance remains comparable to baseline.

Conclusion: Adaptive patch sizing is an effective, deployable approach to accelerate ViTs on high-resolution data without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

*Vitor Pereira Matias,Daniel Perazzo,Vinicius Silva,Alberto Raposo,Luiz Velho,Afonso Paiva,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models scenes as collections of 3D Gaussians to enable real-time novel-view rendering, but it suffers from large memory usage, lighting baked into the representation, and limited secondary-ray support; the abstract outlines a tutorial that reviews the 3DGS pipeline, mitigation efforts, and applications in reconstruction, avatars, animation, and content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a push for fast, high-quality 3D reconstruction and rendering that integrates with standard graphics pipelines. 3DGS offers real-time rendering but faces practical limitations (memory footprint, baked lighting, and lack of secondary-ray effects) that need addressing to broaden its adoption and applicability.

Method: The paper (tutorial) first presents the splatting formulation of 3DGS, then surveys and discusses the main approaches used to tackle its limitations (memory efficiency, lighting disentanglement or separation, handling secondary-ray effects). It then surveys applications that leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and content generation, highlighting its rendering efficiency and compatibility with feed-forward pipelines.

Result: A concise overview and survey of the 3DGS pipeline, the common mitigation strategies for its limitations, and a catalog of applications enabled by 3DGS, emphasizing real-time rendering and integration into graphics workflows.

Conclusion: 3DGS is driving a fundamental shift in 3D reconstruction with fast, real-time rendering and easy pipeline integration, but remains challenged by memory demands, baked lighting, and limited secondary-ray effects. The abstracted tutorial contextualizes current progress and showcases a range of practical applications.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

*Zhiqi Kang,Rahaf Aljundi,Vaggelis Dorovatas,Karteek Alahari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online In-Context Distillation (ICD) lets a small vision-language model learn from a stronger teacher at inference time using sparse, cross-modal demonstrations, reducing the need for costly fine-tuning while improving performance under tight compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce deployment cost and resource demands of vision-language models by enabling strong models to guide smaller ones without extensive fine-tuning, making VLMs viable in low-resource settings.

Method: A small VLM operates with a stronger teacher during inference, distilling knowledge via sparse demonstrations. Key components include cross-modal demonstration selection, teacher test-time scaling to suppress noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries.

Result: Small models see substantial gains (up to ~33% improvement) with very few teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and their performance can rival the teacher’s zero-shot output.

Conclusion: Online in-context distillation is a promising, budget-friendly approach to close the gap between small and large VLMs, enabling effective deployment under resource constraints without extensive fine-tuning.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First study to systematically address full-stack safety and security for language-based collaborative driving; proposes SafeCoop defense (semantic firewall, consistency checks, multi-source consensus) and demonstrates strong improvements under attacks in CARLA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural-language communication promises lower bandwidth and richer semantic interaction for V2X, but introduces vulnerabilities (message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, adversarial attacks) that threaten safety and reliability.

Method: Develop a taxonomy of attack strategies (connection disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, multi-connection forgery); design an agentic defense pipeline SafeCoop with semantic firewall, language-perception consistency checks, multi-source consensus, and an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment; evaluate in closed-loop CARLA across 32 scenarios.

Result: Achieves 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection.

Conclusion: Provides guidance toward safe, secure, and trustworthy language-driven collaboration in transportation; includes a public project page for SafeCoop.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy

*Jiahan Zhang,Muqing Jiang,Nanru Dai,Taiming Lu,Arda Uzunoglu,Shunchi Zhang,Yana Wei,Jiahao Wang,Vishal M. Patel,Paul Pu Liang,Daniel Khashabi,Cheng Peng,Rama Chellappa,Tianmin Shu,Alan Yuille,Yilun Du,Jieneng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-in-World offers the first open benchmark for evaluating world models in closed-loop embodied tasks; it reveals that task success hinges on controllability and data strategy rather than mere visual quality, and provides a data scaling law and compute guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap where prior benchmarks emphasize visuals in open-loop settings, neglecting whether world models actually improve embodied task performance; need a standardized platform to assess decision-making utility of WMs.

Method: Propose World-in-World, an open platform with a unified online planning strategy and standardized action API; four closed-loop environments; evaluate diverse WMs; analyze data scaling post-training and inference-time compute; derive a scaling law for embodied WMs.

Result: Key findings: (1) visual fidelity alone does not ensure task success; controllability matters more, (2) post-training scaling with action-observation data beats just upgrading pretrained video generators, (3) allocating more inference-time compute yields notable gains in closed-loop performance; plus the first data scaling law for embodied WMs.

Conclusion: The platform clarifies what makes WMs useful for embodied tasks, underscores controllability and data-driven scaling as primary levers, and provides a scalable, open benchmark to advance research in embodied AI.

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

*Clementine Grethen,Simone Gasparini,Geraldine Morin,Jeremy Lebreton,Lucas Marti,Manuel Sanchez-Gestido*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LunarStereo provides the first photorealistic open stereo Moon dataset and uses fine-tuning of MASt3R to achieve improved 3D reconstruction and pose estimation on lunar imagery, addressing domain gaps from terrestrial training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome domain shift and data scarcity in lunar 3D reconstruction due to textureless surfaces, challenging lighting, and atypical orbital paths, enabling robust cross-domain generalization to planetary imagery.

Method: Create LunarStereo via ray-traced photorealistic stereo pairs based on high-res lunar topography/reflectance; fine-tune the MASt3R model on this dataset; evaluate on synthetic and real lunar data for 3D reconstruction and relative pose estimation.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements over zero-shot baselines on both synthetic and real lunar data, showing improved 3D reconstruction quality and pose estimation and better cross-domain/generalization performance.

Conclusion: LunarStereo and lunar-optimized MASt3R provide a practical pathway for robust lunar 3D reconstruction and cross-scale generalization in extraterrestrial environments; the dataset enables grounded supervision and broad transfer potential.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

### [27] [VelocityNet: Real-Time Crowd Anomaly Detection via Person-Specific Velocity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18187)
*Fatima AlGhamdi,Omar Alharbi,Abdullah Aldwyish,Raied Aljadaany,Muhammad Kamran J Khan,Huda Alamri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VelocityNet, a real-time dual-pipeline anomaly detection framework for crowded scenes that uses head detection + dense optical flow to derive person-specific velocities, clusters them into semantic motion classes, and uses percentile-based scoring to detect deviations from normal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crowded scene anomaly detection is hard due to occlusions, dynamic motion, and changing crowd density, and existing methods lack interpretable, adaptable indicators.

Method: Two pipelines: (1) head detection to locate individuals, (2) dense optical flow to compute per-person velocity vectors. Hierarchical clustering groups velocities into halt, slow, normal, fast. Anomaly score is computed as a percentile-based deviation from learned normal velocity distribution.

Result: Experiments claim real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns in densely crowded environments, demonstrating effectiveness, though specifics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: VelocityNet offers interpretable motion categories and real-time anomaly detection for crowded scenes, with robustness to occlusions and density variability, but further details on evaluation and limitations are needed.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

### [28] [C-SWAP: Explainability-Aware Structured Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18636)
*Baptiste Bauvin,Loïc Baret,Ola Ahmad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a one-shot pruning framework using explainable AI to perform causal-aware structured pruning without fine-tuning, achieving strong compression with minimal accuracy loss on CNN and ViT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured pruning offers speedups and memory savings but is expensive due to iterative retraining. One-shot pruning methods exist but often degrade performance. The paper aims to enable efficient, post-training pruning that preserves accuracy.

Method: A causal-aware pruning approach that uses cause-effect relations between model predictions and internal structures via explainable deep learning. Prunes in a progressive, one-shot post-training process, removing entire structures (weights, neurons, layers) while preserving performance, without fine-tuning.

Result: Substantial model size reduction with minimal performance loss; outperforms competing one-shot pruning methods; validated on CNN and Vision Transformer baselines pretrained for classification; no fine-tuning required; code available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Explainability-guided, causal-aware pruning enables effective one-shot, post-training structured pruning that delivers strong compression-accuracy trade-offs without additional fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for deployment.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

### [29] [RadDiagSeg-M: A Vision Language Model for Joint Diagnosis and Multi-Target Segmentation in Radiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18188)
*Chengrun Li,Corentin Royer,Haozhe Luo,Bastian Wittmann,Xia Li,Ibrahim Hamamci,Sezgin Er,Anjany Sekuboyina,Bjoern Menze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RadDiagSeg-D (a dataset) and RadDiagSeg-M (a model) for joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation across imaging modalities, achieving strong baselines on text-and-mask tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical vision-language models struggle to generate diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks simultaneously, limiting practical clinical utility of assistive systems.

Method: Introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a unified and hierarchical dataset covering abnormality detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation across multiple imaging modalities; develop RadDiagSeg-M, a vision-language model capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation; benchmark on multi-target text-and-mask generation tasks.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M demonstrates strong performance across all components (detection, diagnosis, and segmentation) and provides a robust and competitive baseline for joint text-and-mask generation in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Joint text-and-mask generation in medical imaging is feasible and beneficial for clinical assistive diagnosis, with RadDiagSeg-D and RadDiagSeg-M advancing the development of unified models and datasets; future work could expand modalities and complexity of tasks.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

### [30] [EMA-SAM: Exponential Moving-average for SAM-based PTMC Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18213)
*Maryam Dialameh,Hossein Rajabzadeh,Jung Suk Sim,Hyock Ju Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM extends SAM-2 with a confidence-weighted exponential moving average (EMA) pointer in a memory bank to create a stable, frame-consistent tumour prototype for ultrasound video segmentation. It improves Dice and IoU, reduces false positives, generalizes to other medical videos, and preserves real-time performance with minimal FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lesion segmentation in interventional ultrasound is hindered by low contrast, probe-induced motion, and heat-related artifacts. SAM-2 is frame-agnostic which causes unstable predictions and temporal drift in dynamic ultrasound settings. There is a need for a lightweight, temporally coherent segmentation approach that can bridge foundation models with the stringent real-time demands of interventional ultrasound.

Method: A lightweight extension of SAM-2 that adds a confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank to maintain a stable latent tumour prototype across frames. This EMA pointer preserves temporal coherence during challenges like probe pressure and bubble occlusion, while allowing rapid adaptation when clearer evidence reappears. The approach maintains real-time throughput (≈30 FPS on an A100) with negligible FLOPs (<0.1%), and is evaluated on a PTMC-RFA dataset and external VTUS/colonoscopy datasets.

Result: On PTMC-RFA (124 minutes, 13 patients): maxDice improved from 0.82 to 0.86; maxIoU from 0.72 to 0.76; false positives reduced by 29%. On VTUS and colonoscopy datasets, EMA-SAM yields consistent 2–5 Dice-point gains over SAM-2. Inference remains real-time (~30 FPS on a single A100) with <0.1% additional FLOPs.

Conclusion: EMA-SAM is a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking in interventional ultrasound, successfully bridging foundation models with the practical demands of interventional imaging. The code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

### [31] [VLSU: Mapping the Limits of Joint Multimodal Understanding for AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18214)
*Shruti Palaskar,Leon Gatys,Mona Abdelrahman,Mar Jacobo,Larry Lindsey,Rutika Moharir,Gunnar Lund,Yang Xu,Navid Shiee,Jeffrey Bigham,Charles Maalouf,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU) framework evaluates safety risks that emerge only when vision and language are combined, highlighting weaknesses in current multimodal models and offering a large, fine-grained benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluations treat vision and language separately, missing joint-interaction risks that can turn benign content harmful. There is a need for a fine-grained, compositional safety benchmark to detect unsafe vs. borderline cases and improve model alignment.

Method: A multi-stage evaluation pipeline using real-world images and human annotations to build a large-scale benchmark (8,187 samples across 15 harm categories) plus 17 safety patterns. Evaluates 11 state-of-the-art models and analyzes joint image-text reasoning gaps, as well as the effect of instruction framing on refusal behavior.

Result: Joint image-text safety labeling accuracy drops to 20-55% (vs >90% for clear unimodal signals). 34% of joint errors occur despite correct unimodal classifications, showing lack of compositional reasoning. Instruction framing reduces over-blocking on borderline content from 62.4% to 10.4% (Gemini-1.5) but lowers unsafe-content refusal from 90.8% to 53.9%, revealing a trade-off between engagement and enforcement.

Conclusion: The study uncovers systemic weaknesses in joint vision-language safety understanding and alignment in current models and provides VLSU as a critical test bed to drive next milestones in robust multimodal safety research.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

### [32] [Beyond Frequency: Scoring-Driven Debiasing for Object Detection via Blueprint-Prompted Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18229)
*Xinhao Cai,Liulei Li,Gensheng Pei,Tao Chen,Jinshan Pan,Yazhou Yao,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a representation-score guided generative debiasing framework for object detection that uses precise visual blueprints and a generative alignment strategy to produce high-quality, unbiased layouts, improving underrepresented object groups and layout fidelity over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debiasing methods are often constrained by sample diversity; naive generative augmentation can preserve the biases it aims to solve. Simply generating more data for rare classes is suboptimal because (i) instance frequency is not a complete proxy for a model's data needs, and (ii) layout-to-image synthesis lacks fidelity to create high-quality, complex scenes.

Method: Introduce a Representation Score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond frequency and guide the creation of new, unbiased layouts. Replace ambiguous prompts with precise visual blueprints and employ a generative alignment strategy to foster communication between the detector and generator.

Result: The approach narrows the performance gap for underrepresented groups, with large instances improving by 4.4 mAP and rare instances by 3.6 mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy in generated images.

Conclusion: RS-guided, blueprint-based generative debiasing improves representational coverage and layout fidelity in object detection, delivering stronger debiasing performance than prior methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

### [33] [DeepSeek-OCR: Contexts Optical Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18234)
*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DeepSeek-OCR to compress long textual contexts into vision tokens for OCR, using DeepEncoder + DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M decoder; achieves high OCR accuracy at moderate compression, shows practical data generation capability and outperforms baselines on OmniDocBench; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle long-context processing and memory constraints in OCR-enabled LLMs/VLMs by compressing long textual content into a small, high-quality set of vision tokens.

Method: Introduce DeepEncoder to aggressively compress high-resolution inputs into a compact token stream with low activations; use DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder to reconstruct/perform OCR; evaluate across compression ratios, compare to baselines, and demonstrate production data generation capability; release code and weights.

Result: OCR accuracy reaches 97% when text tokens are within 10x the vision tokens (compression <10x); ~60% accuracy at 20x; on OmniDocBench it beats GOT-OCR2.0 with 100 vision tokens (256 tokens/page baseline) and beats MinerU2.0 with <800 vision tokens; capable of generating 200k+ pages/day on a single A100-40G for training data.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR demonstrates feasibility of long-context compression for OCR tasks and has practical value for historical long-context applications and LLM/VLM data generation; results are promising and code is publicly available.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at
http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

### [34] [BlendCLIP: Bridging Synthetic and Real Domains for Zero-Shot 3D Object Classification with Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18244)
*Ajinkya Khoche,Gergő László Nagy,Maciej Wozniak,Thomas Gustafsson,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlendCLIP uses curriculum-based data mixing to fuse synthetic CAD data and real-world LiDAR data for open-vocabulary 3D perception. It builds a large multimodal dataset (point cloud, image, text) and shows strong label-efficient gains in zero-shot 3D classification on nuScenes and TruckScenes, with substantial improvements using minimal real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain gap between synthetic training data and real, noisy LiDAR scans limits zero-shot 3D object classification in outdoor scenes. Purely synthetic training lacks real-world diversity; real data alone lacks semantic coverage. A hybrid approach aims to combine the strengths of both domains.

Method: Create a large-scale dataset of object-level triplets (point cloud, image, text) mined from real driving data and annotated 3D boxes. Propose a curriculum-based data mixing strategy: first train/configure on semantically rich synthetic CAD data, then progressively adapt to the characteristics of real-world scans, enabling effective multimodal pretraining (akin to CLIP) across domains.

Result: 1.5% real-world samples per batch yields a 27% absolute boost in zero-shot accuracy on nuScenes. Final model sets state-of-the-art on nuScenes and TruckScenes, with ~19.3% improvement over prior best on nuScenes; maintains strong generalization on synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation through curriculum-based mixing of synthetic and real data is key to robust open-vocabulary 3D perception, reducing reliance on full-scale real-world annotation. Code and dataset slated for release.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenInsGaussian introduces Open-vocabulary Instance Gaussian segmentation with Context-aware Cross-view Fusion, achieving state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation by enriching per-mask context and applying attention-based cross-view feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing 3D Gaussian segmentation approaches: insufficient contextual cues for individual masks during preprocessing and inconsistent/missing details when fusing multi-view 2D features.

Method: Two modules: (1) Context-Aware Feature Extraction that augments each mask with rich semantic context; (2) Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation that selectively fuses multi-view features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, with large-margin improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robustness and generality, advancing 3D scene understanding and enabling practical deployment in diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world
scenarios.

### [36] [Hyperbolic Space Learning Method Leveraging Temporal Motion Priors for Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18256)
*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Weibin Qiu,Zhaocheng Jin,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyperbolic-space learning with a temporal motion prior for video-based 3D human mesh recovery, achieving higher accuracy than SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human meshes exhibit hierarchical structure (torso–limbs–fingers) which is not well captured by Euclidean representations used by existing video-based methods, leading to inaccurate meshes. Hyperbolic space naturally models hierarchies, and incorporating a temporal motion prior can stabilize and guide learning.

Method: Introduce a temporal motion prior extraction module that fuses temporal motion features from 3D pose sequences and image features. Use this prior to drive a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy, operating on 3D pose and pose motion in hyperbolic space to learn mesh features. Include a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss and combine optimized results to produce accurate, smooth meshes.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show superiority over most state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic-space learning with temporal motion priors improves accuracy and smoothness of video-based 3D human mesh recovery by better capturing hierarchical structure and leveraging motion priors.

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

*Da Zhang,Chenggang Rong,Bingyu Li,Feiyu Wang,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UWBench is a new underwater vision-language benchmark with 15,003 images, 15,281 referring expressions, and 124,983 QA pairs, enabling three benchmarks: captioning, grounding, and VQA for underwater understanding; results indicate current VLMs struggle in this domain; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imagery presents unique challenges (light attenuation, color distortion, turbidity) and requires marine ecology and taxonomy knowledge. There is a lack of dedicated vision-language benchmarks for this domain, hindering progress and real-world marine applications.

Method: Construct UWBench by collecting 15,003 high-resolution underwater images from diverse environments (oceans, coral reefs, deep-sea habitats). Obtain human-verified annotations: 15,281 object referring expressions and 124,983 QA pairs. Establish three benchmarks: detailed image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. Evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs on these tasks.

Result: The study reveals that underwater understanding remains challenging for current VLMs, with substantial room for improvement. The dataset introduces rich variation in visibility, lighting, and turbidity, enabling robust evaluation and highlighting domain-specific gaps.

Conclusion: UWBench provides essential resources for advancing vision-language research in underwater contexts and supports marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration. The authors plan to release code and benchmark.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

### [38] [Latent-Info and Low-Dimensional Learning for Human Mesh Recovery and Parallel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18267)
*Xiang Zhang,Suping Wu,Sheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for 3D human mesh recovery that uses hybrid latent features from both low- and high-frequency image components and a low-dimensional, parallel mesh–pose interaction to reduce computation while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D mesh recovery methods struggle with latent information exploitation, leading to limb misalignment and poor local detail; attention-heavy mesh–pose interactions incur high computational costs.

Method: Stage 1 extracts global and local information from low- and high-frequency image features and aggregates them into a hybrid latent frequency-domain feature to enhance 2D-to-3D learning. Stage 2 uses these features to model interactions between a rough 3D mesh template and the 3D pose, via a low-dimensional mesh–pose interaction implemented through dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization to reduce cost.

Result: Extensive experiments on large public datasets show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The two-stage latent-frequency framework with low-dimensional mesh–pose interaction effectively improves reconstruction quality while lowering computation, addressing misalignment and detail loss in complex scenes.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

### [39] [TreeFedDG: Alleviating Global Drift in Federated Domain Generalization for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18268)
*Yucheng Song,Chenxi Li,Haokang Ding,Zhining Liao,Zhifang Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeFedDG proposes a tree-structured FedDG framework to mitigate global drift in medical image segmentation by hierarchical parameter aggregation, parameter-difference style mixing, progressive personalized fusion, and model-chain ensemble retrieval, achieving superior cross-domain generalization on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning for medical image segmentation faces privacy and data heterogeneity, leading to global drift and degraded cross-domain generalization. Existing FedDG approaches often misbalance information aggregation across clients across domains, motivating a new framework to mitigate global drift and enhance generalization.

Method: 1) Tree-based hierarchical parameter aggregation to align global model direction with distributed data characteristics. 2) FedStyle, a parameter difference-based style mixing technique, to maximize cross-client diversity and robustness against drift. 3) Progressive personalized fusion during model distribution to balance knowledge transfer with client-specific features. 4) Inference-time retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the tree using feature similarity for ensemble decision making, leveraging hierarchical knowledge.

Result: Experiments on two public medical image segmentation datasets show that TreeFedDG outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization baselines in cross-domain performance and achieves a better balance of performance across domains.

Conclusion: TreeFedDG effectively mitigates global drift in federated domain generalization for medical imaging by combining hierarchical aggregation, style-based cross-client mixing, personalized fusion, and model-chain ensemble retrieval, yielding improved cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

### [40] [StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269)
*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM is a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that bounds latency and memory for streaming video LLMs by enforcing a fixed per-frame token budget and a 4-bit, on-demand kv-cache, achieving large efficiency gains with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Streaming video vision-language models suffer from causality (no future frames) and accumulation (unbounded token growth). Existing methods mostly regulate the post-LLM kv-cache; pre-LLM prefill remains costly. There is a need for a training-free solution that reduces prefill cost and keeps memory growth bounded while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame token budget, selecting tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency to process only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame; (2) Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them to keep the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. The framework is training-free and plug-and-play.

Result: Achieves 15.7x kv-cache compression, 1.2x lower peak memory, and 2x faster Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) compared to prior SOTA methods. Maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of 63.8% on offline benchmarks and 55.8%/3.7 on RVS datasets.

Conclusion: StreamingTOM demonstrates that a two-stage strategy—reducing per-frame prefill and using quantized, on-demand memory—provides efficient streaming video understanding with bounded memory growth while preserving competitive accuracy, making it a practical training-free solution for streaming video VLMs.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

### [41] [Efficient Few-shot Identity Preserving Attribute Editing for 3D-aware Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18287)
*Vishal Vinod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a few-shot, 3D-aware face editing method that learns latent edit directions for identity-preserving attributes in 3D-aware generative models, enabling photorealistic edits with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D face editing with identity preservation is hard due to view consistency across poses and high data demands; the work seeks to reduce data requirements and enable 3D-consistent edits by learning linear latent directions informed by 2D editing techniques.

Method: Builds on 3D-aware generative models and 2D portrait editing. Estimates edit directions in the latent space from ten or fewer labeled images per attribute. Uses synthetic images (masked data) to generate attribute examples for estimation. Investigates linearity via sequential editing and applies the 2D Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to explore a continuous style manifold for 3D-consistent face aging. Provides code and results at the given URL.

Result: Demonstrates that small labelled sets suffice to estimate latent edit directions for 3D-aware attribute editing. Shows one-shot or few-shot stylization via sequential edits and continuous aging edits. Code and results are available online.

Conclusion: The approach reduces data and computation barriers for 3D portrait editing by exploiting latent-space linearity and 3D-aware generation, enabling controllable, photorealistic edits with 3D consistency; indicates potential for high-resolution editing and broader applicability.

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

### [42] [GeoDiff: Geometry-Guided Diffusion for Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18291)
*Tuan Pham,Thanh-Tung Le,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that adds stereo guidance to diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) to recover metric depth without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image depth estimation with diffusion priors yields reliable relative depth but struggles with absolute metric depth due to scale ambiguity. The goal is to obtain metric depth reliably across varied environments without requiring retraining.

Method: Reframe depth estimation as an inverse problem using pretrained latent diffusion models conditioned on RGB images, augmented with stereo-based geometric constraints to learn scale and shift. The approach is training-free and integrates with existing DB-MDE frameworks to recover metric depth.

Result: Experiments show the method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art DB-MDE methods, particularly on translucent and specular surfaces, across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments, all without retraining.

Conclusion: A training-free, diffusion-prior–plus–stereo-geometry framework can achieve accurate metric depth from monocular input, generalizing well across diverse scenes without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

### [43] [Proactive Reasoning-with-Retrieval Framework for Medical Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18303)
*Lehan Wang,Yi Qin,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-RwR is a multimodal medical reasoning framework that actively retrieves external knowledge during reasoning, addressing hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by integrating observed visual findings and textual clinical information; it introduces a two-stage RL strategy and a test-time Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR), achieving strong improvements on medical benchmarks and good generalization (ECBench 8.8% gain).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) often hallucinate and misreason when restricted to internal knowledge, especially in medical contexts where visual data (scans/images) are crucial. Existing agentic RAG methods are unimodal and ignore visual reasoning. There is a need for a multimodal retrieval-enabled reasoning framework that leverages both vision and text to improve reliability and transparency.

Method: Propose Med-RwR: a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy with rewards crafted to encourage leveraging both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information to retrieve external knowledge during reasoning. The framework actively queries observed symptoms or domain-specific concepts. Additionally, introduce Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) for test-time scaling when the model exhibits low confidence, enabling dynamic retrieval adjustments.

Result: Empirical evaluations on public medical benchmarks show Med-RwR outperforms baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of external knowledge integration for reasoning. The model generalizes well to unfamiliar domains, achieving an 8.8% performance gain on the EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench) despite limited echocardiography data in training. The authors also commit to releasing data, model, and code.

Conclusion: Integrating external knowledge with multimodal reasoning via retrieval and uncertainty-aware test-time re-retrieval substantially enhances reliability and generalization of medical MLLMs. Med-RwR presents a viable path to more transparent and capable medical AI systems, with practical release plans.

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

*Liangyu Chen,James Burgess,Jeffrey J Nirschl,Orr Zohar,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Native-resolution training/inference substantially improves biomedical MLLMs; misalignment between training and inference resolutions degrades performance; mixed-resolution training mitigates misalignment and balances compute with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical imaging requires preserving fine details; many multimodal language models use low-resolution images, risking critical information loss. Understanding how resolution affects performance and how to mitigate misalignment is essential for clinical and research impact.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation of biomedical MLLMs across multiple tasks at varying resolutions. Compare native-resolution training/inference to downsampled baselines, assess the impact of train–inference resolution mismatch, and propose mixed-resolution training to balance performance and computational constraints.

Result: Training and inference at native resolution yield notable performance gains across tasks. Misalignment between training and inference resolutions significantly degrades results. Mixed-resolution training reduces degradation and provides a practical balance between accuracy and compute.

Conclusion: Prioritize native-resolution inference and adopt mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

*Bohan Li,Zhuang Ma,Dalong Du,Baorui Peng,Zhujin Liang,Zhenqiang Liu,Chao Ma,Yueming Jin,Hao Zhao,Wenjun Zeng,Xin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniNWM is a unified panoramic world model for autonomous driving that jointly handles state (RGB, semantics, depth, 3D occupancy), action (panoramic Plucker ray-map), and reward (occupancy-derived rules), achieving state-of-the-art video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability via occupancy-grounded rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving world models are limited in state modalities, sequence length, action precision, and reward awareness. A single framework addressing all three dimensions can improve generation fidelity, control accuracy, and evaluation reliability.

Method: Proposes OmniNWM: (1) joint generation of panoramic RGB, semantics, depth, and 3D occupancy; (2) long-horizon auto-regressive generation with a forcing strategy; (3) a normalized panoramic Plucker ray-map encoding input trajectories into pixel-level signals for precise control over panoramic video; (4) rule-based dense rewards derived directly from generated occupancy rather than external reward predictors; extensive experiments show improvements.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in video generation quality, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability; provides a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework via occupancy-grounded rewards; project page available.

Conclusion: OmniNWM offers a unified approach to modeling state, action, and reward in autonomous driving, enabling high-fidelity multi-modal generation, precise control, and safer evaluation, with strong empirical results and a practical research page.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

*Jinlin Li,Yuran Wang,Yifei Yuan,Xiao Zhou,Yingying Zhang,Xixian Yong,Yefeng Zheng,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED) is a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that reduces object hallucination in LVLMs by weighting multiple models per decoding step based on uncertainty and incorporating diverse decoding paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination; existing mitigations rely on extra training objectives or modules; issues of scalability, adaptability, and model independence; a training-free, scalable solution is needed for robust, high-stakes tasks.

Method: ATED ensembles predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference without additional training, computes uncertainty-based weights for each model at each decoding step, and integrates diverse decoding paths to improve grounding and semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on standard hallucination detection benchmarks show ATED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without sacrificing fluency or relevance.

Conclusion: Adaptive ensembling is a promising direction for improving LVLM robustness in high-stakes applications; code is available at the authors' GitHub.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

### [47] [Enhancing Few-Shot Classification of Benchmark and Disaster Imagery with ATTBHFA-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18326)
*Gao Yu Lee,Tanmoy Dam,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Daniel Puiu Poenar,Vu Duong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net) improves few-shot learning for disaster imagery by aggregating feature probability distributions using Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distance, with a distributional contrastive loss, achieving better generalization on disaster datasets and standard FSL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster image classification is critical but data-scarce and diverse; current FSL benchmarks lack remote-sensing disaster imagery; high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity hinder metric-based FSL.

Method: Proposes ATTBHFA-Net that linearly combines Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare/aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototypes; uses distributional contrastive loss (Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based) with cross-entropy.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets, showing improved effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: Distribution-based aggregation and loss improve FSL performance in disaster imagery; the approach aligns with contrastive learning but operates on probability distributions, enhancing inter-class separability while regularizing intra-class alignment.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

*Kaiyuan Tan,Yingying Shen,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Guang Chen,Hangjun Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a four-stage pipeline for realistic street-view extrapolation in NVS for autonomous driving, achieving first place on the RealADSim-NVS benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic extrapolation is crucial for closed-loop autonomous driving simulation, but current NVS methods produce distorted views beyond the original trajectory, hindering realistic long-horizon extrapolation.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) data-driven initialization to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud; (2) impose geometric priors by modeling road surfaces with a dimension-reduced SDF called 2D-SDF; (3) use a generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints for auxiliary supervision; (4) a data-driven adaptation network to remove time-specific artifacts.

Result: On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, the method achieves a final score of 0.441 and ranks first among participants.

Conclusion: The proposed approach combines data-driven initialization, geometry priors, and generative/pseudo supervision with an adaptation module to deliver state-of-the-art extrapolation performance for street-view NVS in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

### [49] [Visual Space Optimization for Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00330)
*Xinsheng Wang,Shanmin Pang,Jihua Zhu,Zhongyu Li,Zhiqiang Tian,Yaochen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two strategies to optimize the visual embedding space for zero-shot learning: (1) learn a visual prototype per class to replace many discrete visuals, and (2) learn a common intermediate embedding space (via an MLP) to structure visuals more distinctly; experiments on four datasets show benefits and state-of-the-art for the prototype method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual feature space is highly discrete and may hinder semantic-visual alignment; improving how visual space is shaped can improve embedding of semantic vectors and nearest-neighbor retrieval for unseen classes.

Method: 1) Visual prototype based method: learn a per-class visual prototype representing each class as a single prototype in the visual space. 2) Intermediate embedding space: train an MLP-based framework to learn a shared intermediate embedding space and adapt visuals to be more distinctive within that space.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets demonstrates that optimizing visual space benefits zero-shot learning; the visual prototype approach achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Optimizing the visual embedding space is beneficial for zero-shot learning, with the proposed prototype-based method delivering state-of-the-art performance and the intermediate-space approach strengthening the data structure for better recognition of unseen categories.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

### [50] [GPTFace: Generative Pre-training of Facial-Linguistic Transformer by Span Masking and Weakly Correlated Text-image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18345)
*Yudong Li,Hao Li,Xianxu Hou,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A web-scale generative pre-training framework for facial knowledge learning that uses self-supervised MILM/ITM on images and text containing faces, enabling controllable generation and broad face-editing capabilities, with competitive results on key face tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial understanding relies on manually labeled datasets that are labor-intensive and limited in scope. There is a need for scalable pre-training on large, diverse, unlabeled web data to improve transfer to facial tasks and support editing/synthesis applications.

Method: Pre-train on large-scale, web-sourced face-text data using self-supervised objectives: masked image modeling (MILM), masked language modeling (MLM), and image-text matching (ITM). During generation, incorporate ITM loss to steer outputs toward explicit control signals, enabling controllable image/text generation.

Result: The model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models on facial downstream tasks such as attribution classification and expression recognition. Additionally, the approach supports a broad range of face editing tasks, including attribute editing, expression manipulation, mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Conclusion: Leveraging web-scale facial data with self-supervised generative pre-training is effective for facial knowledge learning, offering scalable data utilization and versatile capabilities in both recognition and editing tasks, with potential applicability beyond faces.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

### [51] [AV-Master: Dual-Path Comprehensive Perception Makes Better Audio-Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18346)
*Jiayu Zhang,Qilang Ye,Shuo Ye,Xun Lin,Zihan Song,Zitong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-Master introduces dynamic temporal sampling and modality preference to AVQA, plus a dual-path contrastive loss, achieving strong improvements on four benchmarks, especially for complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AVQA methods struggle with redundancy and fragmentation due to fixed temporal sampling and lack of explicit modality-aware weighting, hindering focus on question-relevant information and cross-modal reasoning.

Method: 1) Dynamic adaptive focus sampling that progressively emphasizes audio-visual segments relevant to the question to reduce redundancy. 2) A preference-aware strategy that models each modality's contribution independently to selectively activate critical features. 3) A dual-path contrastive loss enforcing consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality dimensions to learn question-specific cross-modal representations.

Result: Significant performance gains over existing methods on four large-scale AVQA benchmarks, with notable improvements on tasks requiring complex reasoning.

Conclusion: Dynamic temporal and modality-aware modeling, combined with cross-modal contrastive learning, substantially enhances AVQA by focusing on key information and learning robust cross-modal representations.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

### [52] [Ranking-based Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models from Implicit User Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18353)
*Yi-Lun Wu,Bo-Kai Ruan,Chiang Tseng,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new IRL-based ranking approach, Diffusion-DRO, eliminates reward-model dependence and fuses offline demonstrations with online samples, yielding superior alignment of text-to-image diffusion models to human preferences via a denoising objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO and REINFORCE have limitations: difficulty estimating image probabilities with the sigmoid, and limited diversity in offline data, which hinders stable, data-efficient preference learning; a framework that robustly captures human preferences with mixed data is needed.

Method: Frames preference learning as inverse reinforcement learning with a ranking formulation, simplifying training to a denoising objective; does not rely on a reward model; integrates offline expert demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples to cover diverse preferences.

Result: Demonstrates improved generation quality on challenging and unseen prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies; source code and pre-trained models released.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO provides a robust, data-efficient preference learning framework for diffusion models, addressing non-linear probability estimation and data diversity issues, and enabling better alignment with human preferences; has open-source resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

### [53] [Learning Human-Object Interaction as Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18357)
*Jiajun Hong,Jianan Wei,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GroupHOI, a group-based HOI detection framework that models higher-order interactions by grouping humans/objects by geometry and aggregating context within each group via self-attention, plus semantic-enhanced decoder, achieving state-of-the-art on HOI benchmarks and NVI-DET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world HOI often arises from collective activities involving multiple humans and objects; existing methods focus on pairwise relations and miss group-level interactions, necessitating a group-centric relational modeling approach that leverages geometry and semantics.

Method: 1) Learn a proximity-based clustering of human/object proposals using spatial features from bounding boxes. 2) In each cluster, compute soft correspondences via self-attention to propagate and dispatch contextual cues. 3) Enhance the transformer-based interaction decoder with local semantic cues from HO-pair features to capture semantic similarity. 4) Validate on HOI benchmarks (HICO-DET, V-COCO) and Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET).

Result: GroupHOI achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on standard HOI benchmarks (HICO-DET, V-COCO) and shows strong results on the more challenging NVI-DET task, indicating effective modeling of higher-order/group interactions.

Conclusion: A group-centric, proximity- and semantics-aware relational modeling framework effectively captures higher-order HOI dynamics, improving both traditional HOI detection and nonverbal, higher-order interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

### [54] [FeatureFool: Zero-Query Fooling of Video Models via Feature Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18362)
*Duoxun Tang,Xi Xiao,Guangwu Hu,Kangkang Sun,Xiao Yang,Dongyang Chen,Qing Li,Yongjie Yin,Jiyao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatureFool is a zero-query black-box attack in the video domain that uses DNN feature maps to shift the video feature space, achieving over 70% attack success without any queries and transferring to Video-LLMs, while producing high-quality, barely perceptible adversarial videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN vulnerability is established and black-box attacks typically require many queries; in the video domain and for Video-LLMs there is a lack of feature-map-based attacks, motivating a stealthy, query-free approach.

Method: Employs information extracted from a DNN’s feature maps to alter the clean video feature space, enabling a zero-query attack without iterative model interaction and relying on feature-space manipulation rather than querying the model.

Result: Achieves an attack success rate above 70% against traditional video classifiers without any queries; transferability to Video-LLMs; adversarial videos retain high visual quality (SSIM, PSNR) and show low temporal-inconsistency, making the attack hard to detect.

Conclusion: Introduces FeatureFool, a stealthy zero-query video-domain attack that uses internal feature maps to perturb the video feature space, posing practical risks to Video-LLMs and highlighting the need for defenses against non-query, feature-space adversarial methods.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

### [55] [Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment for Image Complexity Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18377)
*Yuqing Luo,Yixiao Li,Jiang Liu,Jun Fu,Hadi Amirpour,Guanghui Yue,Baoquan Zhao,Padraig Corcoran,Hantao Liu,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-modal framework CM-SSA uses scene semantic alignment with text prompts to improve image complexity assessment by guiding a regression branch; shows superior performance on ICA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICA is subjective and often relies on single-modality features, which may fail to capture semantic aspects of scene complexity. Cross-modal scene semantics (image-text) can provide richer cues aligned with human perception, an underexplored area in ICA.

Method: Propose CM-SSA with two branches: a complexity regression branch guided by a scene semantic alignment branch, and a scene semantic alignment branch that learns pairwise alignment between images and text prompts conveying rich scene semantics to inform complexity estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ICA datasets demonstrate that CM-SSA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with code released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Cross-modal scene semantic alignment improves image complexity assessment by aligning predictions with human perception, validating the value of cross-modal information in perceptual tasks.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

*Giorgio Piras,Qi Zhao,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Christian Wressnegger,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-in method S2AP that minimizes score-space sharpness during mask search in adversarial pruning to stabilize mask selection and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-space optimization in adversarial pruning yields sharp local minima and unstable masks, harming robustness.

Method: Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP): perturb importance scores during mask search and minimize the corresponding robust loss; integrate as a plug-in in the pruning pipeline.

Result: Empirical results across datasets/models/sparsity levels show reduced score-space sharpness, stabilized mask selection, and improved robustness of pruned models.

Conclusion: S2AP provides a simple, effective plug-in to enhance adversarial pruning robustness by addressing sharpness in score space; broad applicability validated by experiments.

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

*F. Ahmadi,B. Bidabad,H. Nasiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Entropy-based geometric features from conformal surface maps plus Gaussian curvature differentiate AD from controls with ~98.6% accuracy using MLP and logistic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease causes cortical atrophy; robust, automated surface-based morphometry can aid diagnosis; entropy of geometric features may capture subtle shape changes.

Method: Reconstruct cortical surfaces with Freesurfer from T1 MRI (80 AD, 80 controls). Compute area distortion and conformal factor via Ricci flow, and Gaussian curvature. Apply Shannon entropy to these features to form feature vectors. Train and evaluate classifiers (XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Statistical comparisons via paired Welch's t-test.

Result: Significant discrimination between AD and controls; MLP and Logistic Regression achieve 98.62% accuracy and F1 score.

Conclusion: Entropy of conformally-derived geometric features is a powerful, robust metric for cortical morphometry, yielding high diagnostic performance and potential clinical utility for AD.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

*Linsong Shan,Zecan Yang,Laurence T. Yang,Changlong Li,Honglu Zhao,Xin Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Bayesian Fully-Connected Tensor Network (BFCTN) for hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion to better preserve spatial–spectral structures and cross-dimensional correlations, while reducing manual parameter tuning; demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-decomposition–based fusion methods disrupt intrinsic spatial-spectral structures due to vectorization/reshaping and rigid factor arrangements. FCTN helps but still reorganizes data unfavorably. There is a need for robustness against noise/degradation and less manual tuning.

Method: Introduce Bayesian BFCTN with a hierarchical sparse prior that enforces sparsity and connects factor tensors, explicitly modeling physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local homogeneity. Use Variational Bayesian inference and EM for parameter learning to reduce manual tuning.

Result: Experiments show BFCTN achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy and robustness, with practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: BFCTN effectively preserves intrinsic spatial–spectral structures and cross-dimensional correlations while offering robust performance and reduced manual tuning in hyperspectral–multispectral fusion.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

### [60] [ScaleNet: Scaling up Pretrained Neural Networks with Incremental Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18431)
*Zhiwei Hao,Jianyuan Guo,Li Shen,Kai Han,Yehui Tang,Han Hu,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleNet enables efficient depth expansion of ViTs by inserting layers with shared weights and per-layer adapters, achieving better accuracy than training from scratch with far fewer epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training very large vision transformers is expensive; there is a need to scale pretrained ViTs efficiently without retraining all parameters from scratch.

Method: Insert additional layers into pretrained ViTs with weights shared from corresponding pretrained layers. Each added layer has a small set of adapter parameters to adjust the shared weights, ensuring distinct, task-specific behavior while keeping parameter count low.

Result: On ImageNet-1K, a 2x depth DeiT-Base with ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy gain over training from scratch, while using only one-third of the training epochs; the method also shows potential for downstream tasks like object detection.

Conclusion: ScaleNet offers a cost-effective approach to scaling ViTs by sharing weights across added layers and using adapters for per-layer customization, delivering strong performance gains with reduced training cost and promising applicability to downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,

*Yuanhe Guo,Linxi Xie,Zhuoran Chen,Kangrui Yu,Ryan Po,Guandao Yang,Gordon Wetztein,Hongyi Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageGem provides a real-world, fine-grained user-preference dataset to enable personalized generative models, showing improvements in preference alignment, personalized retrieval/recommendations, and latent-weight-space editing for customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lack in-the-wild, fine-grained user-preference data, hindering personalization. The dataset addresses this gap by collecting extensive real user interactions, enabling better alignment and personalized downstream tasks.

Method: Collect real-world use data from 57K users (242K LoRAs, 3M prompts, 5M generated images). Annotate user preferences; train preference-alignment models; evaluate personalized image retrieval and generative-model recommendations; propose end-to-end latent-weight-space editing to align diffusion models with individual preferences.

Result: The dataset enables a new paradigm for personalization, achieving better preference alignment and enabling personalized retrieval/recommendation and diffusion-model editing; first demonstration of leveraging in-the-wild preference data for such tasks.

Conclusion: ImageGem catalyzes generative-model personalization by providing real-world, fine-grained user-preference data; future work includes broader personalization scenarios and improving alignment methods.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

### [62] [Beyond Single Images: Retrieval Self-Augmented Unsupervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18437)
*Ji Du,Xin Wang,Fangwei Hao,Mingyang Yu,Chunyuan Chen,Jiesheng Wu,Bin Wang,Jing Xu,Ping Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE introduces a self-augmented COD framework that leverages unlabeled training data to build prototype libraries and generate pseudo-labels via clustering and multi-view KNN retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised and prompt-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) suffers from reliance on image-level features and costly annotations; existing methods underutilize dataset-level context. There is a need to harness the entire training set to produce high-quality pseudo-labels for supervision without ground-truth masks.

Method: Construct prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using training images without ground-truth; generate pseudo-masks via KNN retrieval. Address library quality with a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy that produces coarse masks via clustering, followed by histogram-based filtering and cross-category retrieval to yield high-confidence prototypes. In KNN retrieval, apply Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR) to fuse results from diverse views and mitigate feature-map artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RISE outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods on COD benchmarks. Code is publicly available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: RISE demonstrates the viability of dataset-level self-augmentation for COD by combining CR-based prototype construction with MVKR-style multi-view retrieval, reducing reliance on annotations and leveraging unlabeled data to train robust COD models.

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

*Anna Oliveras,Roger Marí,Rafael Redondo,Oriol Guardià,Ana Tost,Bhalaji Nagarajan,Carolina Migliorelli,Vicent Ribas,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent diffusion model generates high-quality 3D chest CT scans conditioned on 3D masks, achieving 256x256x256 at 1 mm, with global lung structure essential for accurate synthesis; enables diverse volumes with/without nodules at lower compute; useful for training and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data is scarce and sensitive. A controllable, realistic synthetic 3D CT generator can augment datasets, preserve privacy, and facilitate training of AI models and clinicians by enabling targeted, diverse, and cost-efficient data generation.

Method: Train a latent diffusion model conditioned on 3D anatomical masks that specify lung and nodule regions. Outputs are volumetric CTs of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm resolution. Uses a single mid-range GPU to reduce computational cost. Experiments show that including global lung structure in conditioning is crucial; nodules alone yield anatomically incorrect results. The approach supports generating volumes with/without nodules and varying attributes.

Result: The model demonstrates that global context is essential for realistic conditional synthesis; conditioning on nodules alone is insufficient. It can produce diverse, controllable CT volumes within practical compute constraints, suitable for augmenting training data and aiding healthcare professionals.

Conclusion: A cost-effective, practical method for realistic 3D CT synthesis conditioned on anatomical masks, offering a tool for AI training and clinical education, with validated importance of including global organ context.

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

### [64] [Vision Foundation Models Can Be Good Tokenizers for Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18457)
*Tianci Bi,Xiaoyi Zhang,Yan Lu,Nanning Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VFM-VAE to replace distillation-based alignment in LDMs, using a redesigned decoder to fuse VFM features at multiple scales, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction from coarse VFM inputs; introduces SE-CKNNA to diagnose diffusion dynamics and accelerate joint tokenizer-diffusion training. Achieves strong gFID scores (2.20 at 80 epochs; 1.62 at 640 epochs) with large speedups, supporting direct VFM integration as a superior LDM paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distillation-based alignment of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into latent diffusion models weakens robustness and semantic alignment under distribution shifts. There is a need for a direct integration that preserves VFM semantics while maintaining pixel-level fidelity and training efficiency.

Method: Design a Vision Foundation Model Variational Autoencoder (VFM-VAE) with a decoder revised by Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution Reconstruction blocks to reconstruct high-quality images from spatially coarse VFM features. Analyze diffusion training dynamics using a new SE-CKNNA metric and develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy to accelerate convergence.

Result: Empirical evidence shows state-of-the-art gFID (without CFG) of 2.20 at 80 epochs (≈10x faster than prior tokenizers); by 640 epochs, gFID (without CFG) improves to 1.62, demonstrating effective direct VFM integration and faster convergence.

Conclusion: Direct integration of VFMs via VFM-VAE, coupled with advanced decoder design and diffusion-dynamics analysis, yields superior performance and training efficiency for LDMs compared to distillation-based approaches, validating direct VFM integration as a preferable paradigm.

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

*Jinfeng Liu,Lingtong Kong,Mi Zhou,Jinwen Chen,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage Gaussian-splatting framework reconstructs renderable 4D HDR scenes from unposed monocular LDR videos with alternating exposures, achieving high-quality HDR rendering more quickly than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable end-to-end reconstruction of dynamic, high-dynamic-range scenes from unposed, monocular LDR video with exposure changes, addressing the lack of camera pose data and temporal consistency in HDR video reconstruction.

Method: Stage 1 learns a video HDR Gaussian representation in orthographic camera space without poses; Stage 2 converts to world space and jointly refines with camera poses; introduces a temporal luminance regularization; builds a new HDR video reconstruction benchmark; based on Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Outperforms adapted state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and speed across experiments; robust initial HDR video reconstruction; improved temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed Mono4DGS-HDR is the first system for renderable 4D HDR reconstruction from unposed monocular LDR videos with alternating exposures, validated by strong experiments and a new benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

### [66] [Zero-Shot Vehicle Model Recognition via Text-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18502)
*Wei-Chia Chang,Yan-Ann Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot VMMR using a VLM + RAG: image-to-attributes, textual retrieval, and LM reasoning; avoids retraining and updates with new models via textual descriptions; ~20% gains over CLIP baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VMMR must adapt to newly released vehicle models; fixed pretrained models like CLIP limit performance and require costly image-specific fine-tuning. A scalable, updatable approach is needed.

Method: A vision-language model converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes. These attributes are matched against a database of textual vehicle features. Retrieved entries are combined with the image description to form a prompt, and a language model infers the make and model (zero-shot). This avoids large-scale retraining and allows rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. The approach leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enable text-based reasoning.

Result: The method yields approximately a 20% improvement in recognition accuracy over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG-enhanced language reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced LM reasoning provides a scalable, update-friendly solution for VMMR that can adapt to new vehicle models by simply adding textual descriptions, reducing the need for costly retraining while delivering strong zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

*Suman Kunwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWaste demonstrates real-time, edge-friendly waste sorting using Greener AI; high-accuracy classifiers trade off with latency, while lightweight detectors offer fast, low-power performance, with quantization boosting efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in convenience packaging creates massive waste requiring efficient sorting; the aim is real-time, edge-capable waste classification/detection to enable sustainable waste management and offline operation.

Method: Benchmarked multiple image classifiers (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and detectors (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) on a custom waste dataset; annotated data with Annotated Lab; evaluated accuracy, latency, model size, and VRAM; applied model quantization to reduce size/VRAM; compared trade-offs.

Result: EfficientNetV2S achieved ~96% accuracy but ~0.22s latency and higher emissions; lightweight detectors achieved up to 77% mAP with ~0.03s inference and <7MB models; quantization reduced size/VRAM by up to 75%.

Conclusion: DWaste demonstrates feasibility of real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices using Greener AI; highlights trade-offs and the potential for offline-first operation.

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

*Junwen Huang,Shishir Reddy Vutukur,Peter KT Yu,Nassir Navab,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframes template-based object pose estimation as a ray-alignment problem using a diffusion transformer to align a non-posed query image with posed templates, achieving competitive unseen-object pose accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Template-based pose methods suffer when the retrieved template is mismatched, leading to inaccurate poses. The work seeks a robust framework that leverages geometric priors from multiple posed templates, borrows diffusion-based pose estimation ideas, and handles both rotation and translation more flexibly.

Method: Formulate pose estimation as aligning query rays with rays from posed templates. Embed this into a diffusion-transformer architecture that maps a non-posed query image to the set of posed templates. Reparameterize rotation using object-centered rays; extend scale-invariant translation to dense translation offsets. Utilize template-derived geometric priors. Employ a coarse-to-fine training strategy with narrowed template sampling; no changes to core network architecture.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for unseen object pose estimation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a geometry-guided, robust framework for template-based pose estimation via ray alignment, demonstrating competitive unseen-object pose results and improved training efficiency through coarse-to-fine sampling without architectural changes.

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

*Dušan Malić,Christian Fruhwirth-Reisinger,Alexander Prutsch,Wei Lin,Samuel Schulter,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing GBlobs, a local point-cloud feature descriptor, to replace global coordinates and curb the geometric shortcut, achieving state-of-the-art generalization for 3D object detection across varied LiDAR configurations in RoboSense 2025 Track 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors rely on absolute Cartesian coordinates, creating a geometric shortcut that biases models toward object position rather than shape and appearance. This harms generalization when sensor placements—and thus point distributions—change.

Method: Propose GBlobs as input features—local point-cloud descriptors designed to emphasize local structure and object-centric cues, reducing reliance on global coordinates and enabling robust generalization across LiDAR configurations.

Result: The approach yields top-ranking performance on RoboSense 2025 Track 3, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization to diverse sensor placements.

Conclusion: Local, object-centric feature descriptors like GBlobs can mitigate geometric shortcuts in LiDAR-based 3D detectors, improving cross-configuration generalization without sacrificing in-domain performance.

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Reenu Mohandas,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-sensor occlusion dataset for autonomous driving that provides controlled, repeatable degradations across camera, radar, and LiDAR to enable reproducible robustness testing of perception and fusion systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust perception under adverse conditions is critical for automated driving; existing datasets lack controlled, parameterised degradations that can be consistently applied across sensing modalities, hindering systematic evaluation of perception and fusion under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.

Method: Extend the nuScenes benchmark by adding Occluded nuScenes with camera data (full and mini versions) featuring four occlusion types (two public adaptations, two new designs) and parameterised occlusion scripts for radar and LiDAR implementing three degradations each, enabling flexible, repeatable data occlusion.

Result: Provides a reproducible resource to evaluate perception models under partial sensor failures across multiple modalities; constitutes the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled degradations, supporting robust sensor fusion analysis and safety-critical perception research in automated driving.

Conclusion: This dataset facilitates systematic, reproducible evaluation of robustness to occlusions in autonomous driving pipelines and is expected to advance research in robust sensor fusion, resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

TL;DR: Kaleido enables subject-consistent video generation from multiple reference images using a dedicated data construction pipeline and Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to improve consistency, fidelity, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current S2V models struggle with multi-subject consistency and background disentanglement due to limited data diversity/quality and suboptimal multi-image fusion, leading to reference drift and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning.

Method: Introduce a dedicated data construction pipeline with low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis to create consistency-preserving training data, and develop Reference Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process multiple reference images for stable, precise multi-image integration.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks show Kaleido significantly outperforms prior methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization (i.e., better reference fidelity and reduced semantic drift).

Conclusion: Kaleido advances S2V generation by addressing data quality/diversity and multi-image integration, enabling more reliable multi-reference conditioning.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

*Yongmin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CovMatch is a scalable multimodal dataset distillation method that jointly optimizes image and text encoders to align cross-modal features via cross-covariance regularization, outperforming prior methods with small synthetic sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal distillation struggles with cross-modal alignment and high compute when using large encoders. Freezing the text encoder in prior work limits semantic alignment and hinders scaling.

Method: CovMatch aligns the cross-covariance between real and synthetic features and regularizes within-modality feature distributions, enabling joint optimization of both image and text encoders (not just the image encoder or projection).

Result: On Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods, achieving up to 6.8% absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic image-text pairs.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing both encoders with cross-covariance alignment and per-modality regularization yields stronger cross-modal alignment and better data-efficient performance than prior freezing-based approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

*Zhangquan Chen,Manyuan Zhang,Xinlei Yu,Xufang Luo,Mingze Sun,Zihao Pan,Yan Feng,Peng Pei,Xunliang Cai,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DThinker enables 3D mental reasoning in vision-language models without explicit 3D priors or labeled 3D data, via a two-stage training regime that aligns 3D latent reasoning with a 3D foundation model and then refines the reasoning trajectory using only outcome signals, yielding improved performance on 3D-spatial benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding 3D spatial relationships from limited views is hard for current VLMs, especially when relying on 2D cues or pure text. There is a need to incorporate implicit 3D geometry into multimodal reasoning without requiring explicit 3D data.

Method: Propose 3DThinker, a framework that exploits rich geometric information within images to support reasoning. It uses a two-stage training: (1) supervised alignment of the model's 3D latent representations with a 3D foundation model (e.g., VGGT); (2) fine-tuning the entire reasoning trajectory based solely on outcome signals to refine 3D mentaling, without 3D priors or labeled 3D data.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating the feasibility and benefit of integrating 3D representations into multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 3DThinker provides a proof-of-concept for 3D mental reasoning in VLMs without 3D inputs, bridging 3D geometry with multimodal reasoning, and points toward a unified 3D representation paradigm for multimodal AI, with code to be released.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

*Sheida Rahnamai Kordasiabi,Damian Dalle Nogare,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: epsilon-Seg uses hierarchical variational autoencoders with center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning, and a Gaussian Mixture Model prior to produce clustering-free, label-efficient semantic segmentation on EM images, achieving competitive results with extremely sparse labels and applicability to fluorescence data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of complex EM images is challenging and relies on expensive, dense labeling; sparse supervision and robust latent representations are needed. Clustering-based pipelines can be brittle and data-hungry.

Method: Train a hierarchical HVAE with center-region masking and an inpainting loss to learn robust embeddings; apply sparse label contrastive learning; enforce a Gaussian Mixture Model prior on the latent space; avoid clustering by using an MLP semantic segmentation head that directly maps latent embeddings to class labels; work with extremely sparse labels (~0.05% of pixels); validate on two dense EM datasets and assess transferability to fluorescence microscopy.

Result: The approach yields competitive sparsely-supervised semantic segmentation on complex biological EM data under very limited labeling, and demonstrates applicability to fluorescence data, indicating robust latent representations and effective label-efficient segmentation.

Conclusion: Clustering-free segmentation from HVAE embeddings guided by contrastive learning and a GMM prior is viable for sparse labeling regimes in complex bio-imaging, offering a practical approach to labeling bottlenecks and potential extension to other microscopy modalities.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ), uses binary quadratic expressions to achieve superior memory efficiency and reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional first-order quantization, with strong PTQ performance on ViT models (e.g., ImageNet gains at 2-bit under calibration-based and data-free scenarios).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional first-order quantization (uniform, binary coding) relies on linear combinations of binary bases and often trades memory for accuracy. There is a need for more expressive yet compact representations to compress matrices and improve post-training quantization of neural networks, especially large models like Vision Transformers.

Method: Introduce Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ), leveraging binary quadratic expressions to approximate matrices in an extremely compact data format. Validate on a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization of pretrained Vision Transformer models.

Result: BQQ delivers a superior memory-efficiency vs. reconstruction-error trade-off compared with traditional methods across diverse matrix data. It achieves strong PTQ performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2% (calibration-based) and 59.1% (data-free) on ImageNet with 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Binary quadratic expressions offer surprising effectiveness for efficient matrix approximation and neural network compression, suggesting broad potential for memory-efficient model deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active-learning framework for satellite image change detection using an invertible network to augment display samples and iteratively retrain a detector with oracle feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce labeling effort and improve change detection performance in satellite imagery by leveraging interactive querying and latent-space data augmentation.

Method: Iterative active learning loop where a question-and-answer model queries an oracle to label a small subset of images (display). An invertible network augments these displays by mapping nonlinear inputs to a latent space where augmentations are linear, then maps back to input space to retrain the change detection model in subsequent iterations.

Result: Experiments show superior performance of the proposed method compared to related work.

Conclusion: The invertible-network-based latent-space augmentation within an interactive active-learning framework improves data efficiency and change-detection performance, with evidence of gains over baselines.

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

### [77] [Beyond the Pipeline: Analyzing Key Factors in End-to-End Deep Learning for Historical Writer Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18671)
*Hanif Rasyidi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end deep learning for historical writer identification often underperforms in realistic, document-level and zero-shot settings, due to weak low-level feature capture and noise; however, a single simple end-to-end setup can reach top-tier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical writer identification (HWI) is hard because handwriting styles vary widely, documents degrade over time, and labeled samples per writer are scarce. While handcrafted methods excel on small, curated datasets, scalable end-to-end approaches are needed for realistic, automated analysis but their robustness remains uncertain.

Method: Systematically evaluate how preprocessing choices, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies (including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation) affect end-to-end HWI performance. Compare end-to-end pipelines with traditional methods, and assess generalization under document-level and zero-shot conditions.

Result: Most end-to-end configurations underperform in realistic, document-level and zero-shot scenarios, failing to capture low-level visual features and suffering from inconsistent patch representations and sensitivity to content noise. Yet, one end-to-end setup with a simpler design achieves results comparable to top-performing systems.

Conclusion: Building robust end-to-end HWI systems remains challenging; design choices focused on stable low-level feature capture, consistent patch representations, and noise resilience are crucial. The study identifies a surprisingly simple configuration that can rival stronger architectures, offering guidance for future robust HWI model development.

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

### [78] [MoGA: Mixture-of-Groups Attention for End-to-End Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18692)
*Weinan Jia,Yuning Lu,Mengqi Huang,Hualiang Wang,Binyuan Huang,Nan Chen,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang,Zhendong Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) enables efficient sparse attention for long video generation by learning token routing, achieving very long context (~580k) and minute-level, 24fps 480p videos, outperforming blockwise sparse methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic full-attention in Diffusion Transformers is a bottleneck for long videos; attention is redundant, so only a small subset of query-key pairs matters. Blockwise sparse methods trade accuracy for efficiency and are limited by block size. A precise, block-free mechanism is needed for long-range interactions.

Method: Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA) uses a lightweight, learnable token router to form mixtures of token groups and route tokens to relevant partners, enabling precise, semantic-aware sparse attention without blockwise estimation. It is kernel-free and integrates with modern attention stacks (e.g., FlashAttention, sequence parallelism).

Result: An end-to-end long video generation model capable of producing minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps with a context length of ~580k. Comprehensive experiments across various video generation tasks validate MoGA's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MoGA provides an efficient, kernel-free sparse attention mechanism that enables long-range interactions for very long contexts in diffusion-based video generation and can be integrated into existing attention architectures, with potential applicability to other long-sequence tasks.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Yibin Wang,Zhimin Li,Yuhang Zang,Jiazi Bu,Yujie Zhou,Yi Xin,Junjun He,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Cheng Jin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGenBench++ is a multilingual, fine-grained benchmark for text-to-image generation with 600 prompts organized hierarchically across 5 themes and 20 subthemes, evaluated on 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria. It provides English/Chinese prompts in short/long forms, uses Gemini-2.5-Pro to build the evaluation pipeline, and trains an offline evaluator to benchmark open- and closed-sourced models, revealing strengths and weaknesses across aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I benchmarks lack sufficient prompt diversity, multilingual support, and fine-grained evaluation, limiting real-world applicability and reliable semantic assessment of generated images.

Method: Construct 600 prompts organized hierarchically (5 themes, 20 subthemes). Evaluate outputs on 10 primary + 27 sub-criteria; provide English and Chinese prompts in short and long forms to test robustness; employ a closed-source MLLM (Gemini-2.5-Pro) to build the benchmark-construction pipeline; train an offline evaluation model for scoring; benchmark both open- and closed-sourced T2I models.

Result: The benchmark enables comprehensive, fine-grained semantic assessment across diverse prompts and languages, exposing strengths and weaknesses of T2I models; provides a reusable offline evaluation model and pipeline for community use.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++ offers a unified, diverse, multilingual, and fine-grained benchmark for T2I semantic evaluation, supporting robust benchmarking across model types and facilitating deeper insights into model capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

*Yiqi Lin,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L introduces a vision-centric contrastive learning framework that renders all inputs as images, enabling cross-modal learning without OCR or text tokens. It uses snippet-level contrastive objectives to relate multimodal document segments and achieves competitive results on new benchmarks (AnyCIR, SeqCIR, CSR) and standard datasets (M-BEIR, MTEB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-style models struggle with complex, real-world web documents where text and images are interleaved or embedded visually. A unified, vision-centric approach that leverages multimodal web data and avoids explicit OCR/tokenization could better capture cross-modal relationships.

Method: A single vision transformer operates in pixel space, rendering textual, visual, and combined inputs as images. It uses a snippet-level contrastive objective to align consecutive multimodal segments and does not require explicitly paired image-text data.

Result: VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal web data for contrastive learning and the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach.

Conclusion: A unified, vision-centric framework is a viable and scalable path for multimodal representation learning, capable of handling complex web documents and leveraging abundant multimodal web data.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces EMIM to integrate motion modeling into transformer-based action recognition by building a cost-volume-like affinity matrix from sliding-window next-frame tokens; improves motion sensitivity on Something-Something datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based action recognition excels on scene-rich data but struggles on motion-sensitive datasets due to insufficient motion modeling. The authors note the similarity between traditional cost volumes and self-attention affinity matrices and aim to leverage this to enhance motion modeling within a unified transformer framework.

Method: Proposes the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). EMIM constructs a cost-volume style affinity matrix by sampling key candidate tokens from the query-based neighboring area in the next frame within a sliding window. This affinity matrix aggregates contextual information for appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling, enabling unified motion modeling integration into transformers.

Result: Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, with particularly strong gains on motion-sensitive datasets (Something-Something V1 & V2).

Conclusion: EMIM effectively injects motion modeling into transformer-based action recognition, improving performance on motion-sensitive datasets by leveraging a cost-volume-inspired affinity matrix to fuse appearance and motion information.

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-free, metric 3D reconstruction framework PLANA3R that uses Vision Transformers to extract sparse planar primitives from unposed two-view images, supervises geometry via planar splatting, and learns without explicit plane annotations, enabling scalable training and strong generalization for indoor scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor man-made environments have strong planar regularities; the goal is accurate metric 3D reconstruction from unposed stereo pairs without requiring 3D plane labels, enabling scalable training and robust performance across domains.

Method: Use Vision Transformers to detect sparse planar primitives from unposed two-view images; estimate relative camera poses; supervise geometry learning via planar splatting by rendering high-resolution depth and normal maps of primitives and propagating gradients through them; train without explicit 3D plane supervision using depth/normal annotations; validate on multiple indoor datasets under metric supervision.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain indoor environments across tasks under metric evaluation: 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative pose estimation; also yields accurate plane segmentation due to planar representation.

Conclusion: PLANA3R shows that a planar primitive-based, pose-free approach can achieve metric 3D reconstruction from unposed views, with scalable training and plane-aware segmentation, suitable for indoor scenes; project page available.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

### [83] [SSD: Spatial-Semantic Head Decoupling for Efficient Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18716)
*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A KV cache compression framework for autoregressive image generation that decouples attention heads into two types—spatial-locality heads with a short recent-token window, and semantic-sink heads with a compact set of highly-attended tokens—achieving ~5× memory reduction and ~6.6× throughput speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models incur heavy memory/compute due to token-level attention; KV-cache approaches are common in NLP but underexplored in vision; identifying spatial locality and emergent semantic sink offers a path to efficient caching.

Method: Adaptive decoupling of attention heads into spatial-locality vs semantic-sink; maintain short window for spatial-locality heads; for semantic-sink heads, preserve a small set of highly-attended tokens; apply KV cache compression to all visual tokens.

Result: 5x memory reduction; 6.6x speedup in throughput; minor visual quality loss; enables efficient generation on constrained hardware.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective KV-cache compression for image generation by exploiting attention patterns, enabling more efficient autoregressive generation on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark IF-VidCap for controllable video captioning with 1,400 samples; evaluates format correctness and content correctness; results show open-source models narrowing the gap with proprietary models; dense-captioning models lag behind general MLLMs on complex instructions; calls for balancing descriptive richness with instruction-following fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video captioning benchmarks measure descriptive coverage but ignore user instruction-following capabilities; there is a need for a benchmark that evaluates controllable captions that follow user formats and content constraints.

Method: Introduce IF-VidCap with a two-dimensional evaluation: format correctness and content correctness, using 1,400 high-quality samples. Evaluate 20+ models, comparing dense-captioning specialized models against general-purpose multimodal LLMs, to assess instruction-following fidelity in video captioning.

Result: Open-source MLLMs are approaching the performance of dominant proprietary models; top open-source methods nearing parity. Models specialized for dense captioning underperform compared to general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions.

Conclusion: Future work should advance both descriptive richness and instruction-following fidelity in video captioning, potentially via architectures or training regimes that jointly improve caption detail and instruction compliance.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

*Hao Wang,Ying Zhou,Haoyu Zhao,Rui Wang,Qiang Hu,Xing Zhang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColIAGS extends 3D Gaussian Splatting for colonoscopy by modeling illumination attenuation and geometry with advanced embeddings to handle dynamic lighting, achieving better view synthesis and geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla 3DGS assumes static illumination and appearance depends only on viewing angle, but colonoscopy scenes have photometric variation due to moving light/camera; previous methods used structure-violating vaporous blobs to compensate, degrading geometry.

Method: Introduce Improved Appearance Modeling with two illumination attenuation factors; cosine embedding input to generate attenuation implicitly; Improved Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to improve geometry attribute prediction; integrate into ColIAGS for real-time rendering and reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results on standard benchmarks show ColIAGS achieves both novel view synthesis and accurate geometric reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with higher rendering fidelity and significantly lower Depth MSE; code forthcoming.

Conclusion: ColIAGS effectively handles illumination variation in colonoscopy 3DGS, preserving geometry while adapting to photometric changes, enabling improved virtual colonoscopy and lesion tracking.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.

### [86] [SEAL: Semantic-Aware Hierarchical Learning for Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18740)
*Zhenqi He,Yuanpei Liu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEAL introduces a hierarchical semantic-guided soft-contrastive framework for Generalized Category Discovery that leverages natural hierarchies and cross-granularity consistency to achieve state-of-the-art results on fine-grained benchmarks and good generalization to coarse-grained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires labeling all images in a dataset with possibly unknown classes. Existing methods rely on single-level semantics or manually designed hierarchies, which limit generalization and scalability. SEAL leverages naturally occurring hierarchical structures to guide learning and handle both known and unknown classes more effectively.

Method: SEAL comprises a Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that uses hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the limitations of conventional hard-negative contrastive losses. It also includes a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module to align predictions across different granularity levels, thereby integrating multi-level semantic information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks (SSB, Oxford-Pet, Herbarium19) and demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets; project page provided.

Conclusion: SEAL advances GCD by exploiting naturally occurring hierarchies and cross-granularity alignment, enhancing robustness, scalability, and generalization in recognizing both known and unknown classes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

*Jannis Fleckenstein,David Kreismann,Tamara Rosemary Govindasamy,Thomas Brunschwiler,Etienne Vos,Mattia Rigotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured data are fine-tuned to predict land surface temperatures to evaluate urban heat island mitigation in data-scarce cities, validated against empirical cooling effects from green spaces, enabling inpainting-based mitigation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urbanization and climate change intensify urban heat islands and accurate local air temperature data are scarce in many areas; geospatial foundation models offer strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning to support mitigation planning in data-poor regions.

Method: 1) Establish ground-truth urban cooling patterns by quantifying green-space cooling effects. 2) Benchmark model predictions against this ground truth. 3) Fine-tune a foundation model to predict land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios. 4) Demonstrate practical value via simulated inpainting to support mitigation planning.

Result: Foundation models demonstrate strong potential for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in data-scarce regions and can guide climate-resilient urban planning through accurate land surface temperature predictions and inpainting-based mitigation support.

Conclusion: Geospatial foundation models are a powerful, data-efficient tool for assessing and guiding urban heat island mitigation in underserved regions, contributing to more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

### [88] [UltraGen: High-Resolution Video Generation with Hierarchical Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18775)
*Teng Hu,Jiangning Zhang,Zihan Su,Ran Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraGen introduces a hierarchical dual-branch global-local attention framework with spatially compressed global modeling and cross-window local attention to enable end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis (1080P/4K), scaling diffusion-transformer video models from low resolution and outperforming state-of-the-art and two-stage super-resolution pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic computational complexity of self-attention limits native high-resolution video generation in diffusion-transformer models, hindering training and inference at 1080P/4K resolutions.

Method: UltraGen uses a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture that decouples full attention into a local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global attention branch for semantic coherence, along with a spatially compressed global modeling strategy and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism, enabling end-to-end training for native high-resolution video synthesis.

Result: Experiments show UltraGen can scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and surpassing two-stage super-resolution pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed UltraGen framework effectively addresses the computational bottlenecks of high-resolution video generation by combining global-local attention decomposition, compressed global modeling, and cross-window local attention to enable practical native high-resolution video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

### [89] [Rebellious Student: A Complementary Learning Framework for Background Feature Enhancement in Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18781)
*Wenping Jin,Yuyang Tang,Li Zhu,Fei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Rebellious Student framework for complementary spectral-spatial learning in hyperspectral anomaly detection; uses reverse distillation for spectral backbone and a decorrelation-based rebellious spatial student to learn orthogonal features; enables parameter-free, training-free anomaly detection with standard detectors; strong HAD100 results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection benefits from both spectral background modeling and spatial context, but conventional teacher-student setups encourage imitation and may miss complementary cues. A method that explicitly learns complementary spatial patterns while preserving spectral robustness can improve detection without per-scene retraining.

Method: Two-stage: (1) spectral enhancement network trained via reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; (2) spatial network (rebellious student) trained with decorrelation losses to enforce feature orthogonality to the spectral teacher while preserving reconstruction fidelity. The framework becomes parameter-free and training-free at deployment when paired with conventional detectors.

Result: Significant improvements on the HAD100 benchmark over established baselines with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Complementary learning via the rebellious student is effective for integrating spectral and spatial cues in hyperspectral anomaly detection, generalizes across detectors, and supports efficient deployment without per-scene retraining.

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

### [90] [ProCLIP: Progressive Vision-Language Alignment via LLM-based Embedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18795)
*Xiaoxing Hu,Kaicheng Yang,Ziyong Feng,Qi Ming,Zonghao Guo,Xiang An,Ziyong Feng,Junchi Yan,Xue Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCLIP introduces a curriculum-learning framework to progressively align a CLIP image encoder with an LLM-based text embedder, via distillation and image-text contrastive tuning with self-distillation and specialized losses, enabling long-text and multilingual understanding while preserving pre-trained CLIP knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's original text encoder is limited to 77 tokens and lacks multilingual support, hindering long-text processing and cross-lingual understanding. Replacing it with an LLM-based embedder offers benefits in long-range and multilingual semantics, but independent pretraining means the LLM space is misaligned with CLIP's image space; naive contrastive alignment risks distorting CLIP's established vision-language alignment.

Method: Step 1: distill knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage CLIP's knowledge and establish initial cross-space alignment with the CLIP image encoder. Step 2: progressively align the CLIP image encoder with the LLM embedder through image-text contrastive tuning, aided by self-distillation to prevent overfitting. Losses include: (a) instance semantic alignment loss and (b) embedding structure alignment loss, employed during representation inheritance and subsequent contrastive tuning, under a curriculum learning paradigm.

Result: The abstract does not report quantitative results. It describes the method and expected capability improvements, stating that ProCLIP effectively aligns the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder and provides code access.

Conclusion: ProCLIP presents a viable solution to extend CLIP's applicability to long-text and multilingual scenarios by progressively aligning CLIP with an LLM embedder, preserving pretraining knowledge while enabling richer multimodal understanding; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond abstract group-theoretical treatments and provide an intuitive, geometry-based understanding and practical construction of steerable convolutions.

Method: Use geometric arguments and pattern-matching principles to justify Clebsch–Gordan decomposition and spherical-harmonic bases; propose constructing steerable layers via interpolation kernels.

Result: Presents a novel interpolation-kernel based architecture for steerable convolutions with improved robustness to noisy data and a simpler, more robust implementation.

Conclusion: Offers an intuitive, scalable framework for steerable CNNs across dimensions, linking harmonic analysis to practical network design and outperforming purely group-theoretic approaches.

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by
many papers, our work provides a new and more intuitive derivation of steerable
convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an
intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition
and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to
construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teacher-student multi-head with self-supervision boosts chest X-ray disease and symptom detection, achieving 98.85% tri-class accuracy (COVID-19/TB/Normal) and macro-F1 90.09% for multilabel symptoms; explainability aligns with anatomical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle radiologist shortage and data scarcity in TB screening; enable scalable AI-assisted screening in resource-limited settings.

Method: A teacher-student framework with two supervised heads and a self-supervised head to detect diseases (COVID-19, TB, Normal) and multilabel symptoms on chest X-rays.

Result: Accuracy 98.85% for tri-class COVID-19/TB/Normal; macro-F1 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection; outperforms baselines; explanations show reliance on relevant anatomical features.

Conclusion: Promising for clinical screening and triage in remote areas; requires further external validation and evaluation of robustness and deployment considerations.

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 2++ is a unified video-tracking model that handles masks, boxes, and points with task prompts, a memory mechanism, and a unified decoder, achieving state-of-the-art across granularities with the Tracking-Any-Granularity dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers are specialized to single tasks, limiting generalization and causing design redundancy; a unified approach is needed to support tracking at multiple granularity levels.

Method: Proposes: (1) task-specific prompts to encode inputs into general prompt embeddings; (2) a unified decoder to produce results in a unified form; (3) a task-adaptive memory mechanism to unify memory across granularities; (4) a data engine and Tracking-Any-Granularity dataset with three granularities to train and benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance across tracking tasks at different granularities.

Conclusion: SAM 2++ provides a unified, robust tracking framework capable of tracking at any granularity, and the new dataset supports training and benchmarking for unified tracking.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

### [94] [Unifying and Enhancing Graph Transformers via a Hierarchical Mask Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18825)
*Yujie Xing,Xiao Wang,Bin Wu,Hai Huang,Chuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified hierarchical masking framework links Graph Transformer architecture with attention-mask design, introducing M3Dphormer (Mixture-of-Experts with multi-level masking and dual attention) to capture diverse interactions. The approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a design principle based on receptive field size and label consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Transformers rely on bespoke architectural tweaks for specific interactions, limiting flexibility and scalability. A unified framework that treats attention masks as central to modeling diverse interactions can unify design, improve adaptability, and guide scalable, efficient modeling.

Method: Propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that characterizes an equivalence between architecture and attention-mask construction. Theoretical analysis shows that larger receptive fields and higher label consistency improve classification probability. Introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts Graph Transformer with three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and a bi-level expert routing mechanism to integrate multi-level interactions. Employ dual attention computation to switch between dense and sparse modes based on local mask sparsity, ensuring scalability. Validate via extensive experiments across benchmarks.

Result: Empirical results across multiple graph benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, supporting the effectiveness of the unified framework and the M3Dphormer design, including the benefits of integrating hierarchical masks and adaptive attention modes.

Conclusion: Hierarchical masks provide complementary strengths; a unified framework linking architecture and mask design is effective for modeling diverse interactions. M3Dphormer demonstrates how multi-level masking with mixture-of-experts and adaptive attention achieves strong performance while maintaining scalability.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

*Yubin Zheng,Pak-Hei Yeung,Jing Xia,Tianjie Ju,Peng Tang,Weidong Qiu,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDEAP enhances CLIP in multi-domain federated learning by disentangling semantic and domain-specific features, using a dual-prompt (global semantic + local domain) design, and aligning text-image representations under learned transformations, yielding improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients hinder generalization of the global model; CLIP's zero-shot capabilities motivate adapting it across domains in FL without losing domain-specific information.

Method: Three components: (1) semantic-domain disentanglement via semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased mappings to reduce loss of domain-specific info during label-supervised tuning; (2) dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt and local domain prompts to preserve both shared and personalized information during global aggregation; (3) alignment of textual and visual representations under the two transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency; plus theoretical analysis and experiments.

Result: Theoretical guarantees and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate improved generalization of CLIP for federated image recognition across multiple domains, outperforming baselines and validating the approach.

Conclusion: FedDEAP provides a principled framework for adaptive federated prompt tuning that preserves domain-specific knowledge while leveraging shared semantic knowledge, leading to enhanced cross-domain generalization in federated CLIP.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeTok renders text as images (visual-text) and uses pretrained multimodal LLMs to read it, avoiding subword tokenization. It matches or surpasses tokenizers while using ~4.4x fewer tokens and 70.5% less FLOPs, with improved cross-lingual generalization and robustness to typographic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reliance on subword tokenization in LLMs fragments text into fixed-vocabulary pieces, which hurts low-resource languages and ignores natural human-like visual reading. A vision-centric approach could leverage OCR and text-vision alignment learned from multimodal data.

Method: Render text as images (visual-text) and interpret with pretrained multimodal LLMs, leveraging OCR and alignment capabilities to extract meaning, across three language tasks.

Result: Matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while using 4.43× fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy.

Conclusion: This work signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, moving toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

*Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Zhengqiang Zhang,Shihao Wang,Tianhe Wu,Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP^2O-SR uses direct perceptual preference optimization to improve Real-ISR by leveraging stochastic outputs from T2I diffusion models. It builds a hybrid, annotation-free reward from full-reference and no-reference IQA models trained on human preferences, creates multiple preference pairs from the same model outputs, and uses hierarchical optimization to adaptively weight training pairs. Model capacity dictates the optimal selection ratio; the method yields significant perceptual gains and generalizes to real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) can benefit from the diverse perceptual outputs of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, but the randomness leads to variable perceptual quality. The goal is to exploit this diversity to improve perceptual quality without costly human annotations.

Method: Construct a hybrid reward by combining full-reference and no-reference IQA models trained on large-scale human preferences. Generate multiple preference pairs from outputs of the same model rather than a single best-vs-worst pair. Analyze how the optimal selection ratio depends on model capacity. Propose hierarchical preference optimization that adaptively weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group diversity. Evaluate on diffusion- and flow-based backbones.

Result: Significant improvements in perceptual quality and generalization to real-world benchmarks across both diffusion- and flow-based backbones.

Conclusion: DP^2O-SR effectively aligns generative models with perceptual preferences without requiring human annotations. The hierarchical, capacity-aware approach yields more efficient and stable learning and can be extended to Real-ISR tasks leveraging generative backbones.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSI-Bench provides a dynamic 3D spatial reasoning benchmark with ~1k videos and 1.7k+ questions across nine motion patterns, exposing limits of current VLMs and expert models in disentangling observer vs. object motion and encouraging dynamic spatial intelligence research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in evaluating dynamic 3D spatial reasoning where existing vision-language and visual expertise models perform well on static/2D tasks but struggle with dynamic scenes that require separating observer and object movements and understanding temporal relations.

Method: Construct almost 1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions spanning nine decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Use spatially and temporally symmetric designs to reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of self-motion and object-motion reasoning. Benchmark 14 VLMs and expert models on the dataset.

Result: Reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative relationships in dynamic scenarios. The benchmark yields valuable findings on current capabilities and directions for developing more capable general and specialized dynamic spatial intelligence models.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench enables systematic evaluation of dynamic spatial intelligence and highlights areas for future model development, including better disentangling of motion types, reducing biases, and advancing dynamic reasoning in 3D environments.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

### [99] [Grasp Any Region: Towards Precise, Contextual Pixel Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18876)
*Haochen Wang,Yuhao Wang,Tao Zhang,Yikang Zhou,Yanwei Li,Jiacong Wang,Ye Tian,Jiahao Meng,Zilong Huang,Guangcan Mai,Anran Wang,Yunhai Tong,Zhuochen Wang,Xiangtai Li,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grasp Any Region (GAR) introduces ROI-aligned feature replay for comprehensive region-level understanding with global context and multi-prompt interactions, plus GAR-Bench evaluation; achieves SOTA on captioning and VQA and transfers to video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal LLMs excel at holistic understanding but struggle in dense scenes; region-level models often analyze given regions in isolation and neglect global context and cross-prompt interactions. There is a need for a method that fuses precise regional perception with global cues and enables interactions across multiple prompts for complex reasoning.

Method: GAR employs ROI-aligned feature replay to inject necessary global context into region-level features and supports interactions between multiple prompts. This enables precise region perception, cross-prompt relational modeling, and advanced compositional reasoning for free-form questions about any region. It introduces GAR-Bench to evaluate single-region comprehension as well as cross-region interactions and complex reasoning.

Result: GAR-1B achieves state-of-the-art captioning performance, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench; excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts, surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. In zero-shot, GAR-8B outperforms VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating strong transfer to video tasks.

Conclusion: GAR demonstrates precise region-level understanding with global context and multi-prompt interactions, enabling advanced compositional reasoning and active dialogue about any region. GAR-Bench provides a more nuanced evaluation of single-region and cross-region reasoning, and the method shows promising transferability to video domains.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

### [100] [From Noise to Laws: Regularized Time-Series Forecasting via Denoised Dynamic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17817)
*Hongwei Ma,Junbin Gao,Minh-ngoc Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a new framework for long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting that combines a score-based diffusion preconditioner, a dynamic correlation-thresholded graph encoder, and a physics-penalized forecast head. It offers theoretical guarantees (contraction and Lipschitz bounds) and achieves state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon forecasting requires denoising heterogeneous signals, capturing time-varying cross-series dependencies, and maintaining stability and physical plausibility; existing methods struggle to satisfy all three simultaneously.

Method: PRISM integrates a score-based diffusion preconditioner, a dynamic graph encoder with correlation thresholding to model inter-series dependencies, and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. The authors prove contraction of horizon dynamics under mild conditions and derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks.

Result: On six standard benchmarks, PRISM achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance with notable improvements in MSE and MAE.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a robust, theoretically-grounded approach to long-horizon multivariate forecasting, combining denoising, dependency modeling, and physics-inspired regularization to deliver accurate and stable predictions.

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because
realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track
time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically
plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a
score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded
graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We
prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and
derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On
six standard benchmarks , PRISM achieves consistent SOTA with strong MSE and
MAE gains.

*Zongze Wu,Yani Guo,Churong Liang,Runnan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Execution-grounded validation (GRETEL) improves tool retrieval by verifying functional viability via sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, outperforming semantic similarity on ToolBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic similarity used for tool retrieval often yields functionally inoperative tools due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution constraints. This semantic-functional gap motivates a method that validates functionality, not just description.

Method: GRETEL implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidate tools through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.

Result: On the ToolBench benchmark, Pass Rate@10 rises from 0.690 to 0.826, Recall@10 from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG@10 from 0.807 to 0.857, indicating consistent improvements across all metrics.

Conclusion: Execution-based validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

*Waleed Razzaq,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid CARLE framework for RUL in PHM that fuses deep (Res-CNN, Res-LSTM with multi-head attention) and shallow learning (Random Forest Regressor) with Gaussian filtering and CWT features; achieves robust, generalizable RUL predictions and interpretable results on bearing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle poor generalization and robustness of existing RUL methods under varying operating conditions.

Method: Preprocess with Gaussian filter; extract time-frequency features via CWT; learn spatial/temporal degradation with Res-CNN and Res-LSTM with multi-head attention and residual connections; predict RUL with Random Forest Regressor; evaluate with ablation, noise and cross-domain tests; interpret with LIME/SHAP.

Result: CARLE outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA, showing robustness under dynamic conditions; ablation confirms component contributions; demonstrates cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: CARLE provides a robust, generalizable, and interpretable RUL estimation framework for PHM; the hybrid deep/shallow architecture and time-frequency features are effective; suggests future exploration of broader domain transfers.

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

TL;DR: A physics-aware, three-component DL framework (Fusion DeepONet, shock-aligned features, two-phase curriculum) to build fast surrogates for rarefied, shock-containing micro nozzle flows; validated on Burgers equation as a proxy for shock gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide fast and accurate surrogate models that handle parameter dependencies and sharp gradients in flows with shocks, integrating physics priors to improve generalization and efficiency.

Method: Proposes Fusion DeepONet operator learning architecture to capture parameter dependencies; physics-guided feature space with shock-aligned coordinates; two-phase curriculum emphasizing high-gradient regions; validated on viscous Burgers equation with advective steepening.

Result: Demonstrates generality and inductive bias of the framework; accurate representation of shock-like gradients in Burgers equation, indicating potential for complex nozzle flows.

Conclusion: The framework offers a general physics-informed approach for surrogate modeling of shock-containing micro flows, combining operator learning, physics-aligned feature spaces, and curriculum strategies to effectively handle high-gradient regions; applicable to shock-containing flow problems such as micro nozzles.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive, physics aware deep learning framework for
constructing fast and accurate surrogate models of rarefied, shock containing
micro nozzle flows. The framework integrates three key components, a Fusion
DeepONet operator learning architecture for capturing parameter dependencies, a
physics-guided feature space that embeds a shock-aligned coordinate system, and
a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To
demonstrate the generality and inductive bias of the proposed framework, we
first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits
advective steepening and shock like gradients.

### [104] [MIN-Merging: Merge the Important Neurons for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17890)
*Yunfei Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIN-Merging is a router-based neuron-merging framework that reduces parameter conflicts when merging open-source models, yielding in-domain gains on CV/NLP while preserving out-of-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of open-source models across CV and NLP enables merging to combine strengths, but parameter conflicts during merging degrade domain-specific performance, and existing methods struggle to mitigate these conflicts.

Method: MIN-Merging employs a router-based approach to selectively merge the most important neurons, aiming to minimize conflicts while preserving useful capabilities.

Result: Experiments on CV and NLP benchmarks show consistent in-domain gains after merging, with pretrained models retaining good out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: MIN-Merging provides a practical solution to the parameter-conflict problem in model merging, delivering reliable in-domain improvements without sacrificing generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

### [105] [Hierarchical Federated Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17895)
*Yisheng Zhong,Zhengbang Yang,Zhuangdi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated, privacy-preserving unlearning framework for LLMs that decouples forgetting from retention using task-specific adapters and a hierarchical merging strategy, enabling scalable handling of continuous, heterogeneous unlearning requests while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need to remove undesirable knowledge from LLMs due to privacy and security concerns. In decentralized settings, unlearning is challenged by inter-/intra-domain interference, asymmetric access, and continuous, heterogeneous requests, risking unbalanced forgetting and degraded performance.

Method: Decouple unlearning and retention by introducing task-specific adapters. Employ federated learning to coordinate updates without sharing sensitive data. Use a hierarchical merging strategy to reconcile conflicting objectives across domains/tasks, enabling robust and adaptable unlearning updates while preserving utility.

Result: Empirical evaluation on WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU benchmarks shows the approach effectively handles heterogeneous unlearning requests and maintains strong LLM utility compared with baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for federated unlearning in LLMs. Adapter-based decoupling plus hierarchical merging mitigates conflicts and supports robust forgetting with retained performance; further work to explore real-world deployment and broader task settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

### [106] [Long-Context Attention Benchmark: From Kernel Efficiency to Distributed Context Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17896)
*Tao Bu,Qiangang Wang,Bowen Zeng,Hanwen Sun,Yunpeng Huang,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A modular, extensible benchmark for evaluating attention kernels and context-parallel strategies in long-context LLM training, enabling reproducible cross-method comparisons and practical deployment guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic complexity of standard attention limits long-context training and hinders scalability. Existing operator-level benchmarks are incomplete and framework-specific context-parallel analyses lack broad evaluation. A unified, extensible benchmark can enable fair comparisons across methods and settings.

Method: Develop a modular benchmark that combines representative attention kernels (kernel/operator level) with context-parallel mechanisms (distributed attention). It evaluates two axes—attention mask patterns and sequence length with distributed scale—through experiments on clusters up to 96 GPUs, enabling reproducible performance comparisons across methods.

Result: The benchmark facilitates reproducible comparisons, highlights trade-offs between kernel optimizations and context-parallel strategies, and yields practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in long-context LLM training.

Conclusion: A unified benchmarking framework addresses evaluation gaps, helping researchers and practitioners choose and deploy efficient attention approaches for long-context LLMs and informing design decisions for scalability.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight, end-to-end trainable Mixture of LoRA Experts (L-MoE) that treats MoE experts as low-rank adapters and learns a differentiable gating mechanism to compose them per token, enabling parameter-efficient, modular MoE models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine MoE's scalability with LoRA's parameter efficiency, achieving dynamic, task-specialized skill composition with end-to-end optimization.

Method: Introduce L-MoE where experts are low-rank adapters; a gating network outputs per-token weights; the framework computes a weighted sum of adapter parameters to form the effective per-token model; gradients flow through adapters and gating; objective is standard autoregressive LM loss; formal mathematical framework and differentiable routing described.

Result: Formal framework established, detailing differentiable routing and joint optimization; demonstrates end-to-end trainability and modular, parameter-efficient MoE without relying on dense expert networks.

Conclusion: L-MoE offers a scalable, modular, parameter-efficient path for LLMs by unifying MoE with LoRA; enables dynamic, token-level skill composition and end-to-end training; practical benefits and future empirical validation anticipated.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Niki van Stein,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate tailored optimization algorithms for auto-tuning, delivering substantial gains over traditional methods and rivaling human-designed optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-tuning faces vast, irregular search spaces and relies on hand-crafted optimizers; there is no universally best method. LLMs offer the potential to create problem-specific optimization strategies.

Method: Prompt LLMs with problem descriptions and search-space characteristics to generate specialized optimization algorithms; iteratively assess and refine these algorithms. Evaluate on four real-world auto-tuning applications across six hardware platforms, comparing against state-of-the-art optimizers from two auto-tuning frameworks.

Result: Incorporating application- and search-space-specific information during generation yields average improvements of 30.7% and 14.6% in different settings. LLM-generated optimizers can rival or outperform existing human-designed algorithms; the best-generated optimizers show an average 72.4% improvement over state-of-the-art auto-tuning optimizers.

Conclusion: LLM-generated optimizers represent a viable new paradigm for auto-tuning, capable of surpassing traditional and even human-designed methods. Future work could broaden task coverage, refine prompting strategies, and deepen analysis across more platforms and workloads.

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

*Alex Acero,Daniel M. Jimenez-Gutierrez,Dario Pighin,Enrique Zuazua,Joaquin Del Rio,Xabi Uribe-Etxebarria*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBVFL reduces vertical FL communication by ~99% while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) suffers from high communication overhead due to the exchange of updates between clients and the server. SBVFL aims to make VFL practical in privacy-sensitive domains by significantly cutting communication and enhancing security.

Method: A distributed training mechanism that decouples the majority of node updates from the server, shifting most computation away from the central coordinator and reducing node-server exchanges while maintaining privacy.

Result: Experimental results claim ~99% reduction in node-server communication compared with standard VFL, with maintained accuracy and robustness across sensitive-domain applications.

Conclusion: SBVFL enables practical, privacy-preserving VFL across domains like healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and defense, broadening the applicability of vertically-partitioned collaborative learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-hoc calibration framework using proximity-based conformal prediction to stratify predictions into putatively correct and incorrect groups, applying dual isotonic regression (calibrated confidence for correct, underconfidence-regularized for incorrect) to improve calibration and uncertainty-aware decision-making without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global calibration methods overlook prediction heterogeneity and the link between calibration quality and uncertainty-aware decisions. There is a need for instance-level adaption to improve both probability calibration and decision making.

Method: Use proximity-based conformal prediction to partition calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. Apply dual calibration: standard isotonic regression for the putatively correct group, and underconfidence-regularized isotonic regression to the putatively incorrect group to damp confidence and facilitate identifying uncertain predictions.

Result: The method achieves fewer confidently incorrect predictions and competitive Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared with isotonic and focal-loss baselines, on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones, without retraining.

Conclusion: Instance-level, post-hoc adaptivity bridges calibration and uncertainty quantification, improving probability alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making without model retraining.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

### [112] [Data Unlearning Beyond Uniform Forgetting via Diffusion Time and Frequency Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17917)
*Jinseong Park,Mijung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-frequency selective data unlearning for diffusion models, plus a normalized SSCD for evaluation, addressing uneven forgetting across diffusion steps to improve generation quality and forgetting effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data unlearning in diffusion models is underexplored and often harms generation quality or leaves residual information. Forgetting likely varies across time steps and frequency content, necessitating targeted strategies.

Method: Identify non-uniform forgetting across time-frequency domains; selectively focus training on specific time-frequency ranges rather than all steps equally; apply this selective approach to gradient-based and preference-optimization objectives across image-level and text-to-image tasks; introduce a normalized SSCD variant to jointly assess deletion and quality.

Result: Improved aesthetic quality and reduced noise for unlearned samples; demonstrated across multiple objectives and tasks (gradient-based, preference optimization, image-level and text-to-image); provides a simple, normalized SSCD for evaluating both deletion and quality of unlearned data.

Conclusion: Time-frequency selective unlearning reveals the non-uniform nature of forgetting in diffusion models and offers practical strategies to enhance both unlearning performance and evaluation; supports broader applicability across objectives and tasks.

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Wei Ju,Jiancheng Lv,Deng Xiong,Ziyue Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPASS enables RL from unlabeled data by self-scoring rewards at test time, combining Dual-Calibration Answer Reward and Decisive Path Reward to produce reliable pseudo-labels and high-quality reasoning chains, yielding gains across models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on human-labeled rewards in RL for LLMs; enable scalable learning from continuous experience; address risk of reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels in self-consistent consensus.

Method: Introduce COMPASS with two components: DCAR for calibrating confidence and credibility to produce trustworthy pseudo-labels; DPR for rewarding precise and decisive reasoning paths; jointly optimized at test time without external supervision.

Result: Empirical results show significant and consistent improvements across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, demonstrating scalability and robustness of the approach.

Conclusion: COMPASS offers a scalable, self-supervised reward mechanism for RL in LLMs, promoting better reasoning and generalization when learning from unlabeled experience streams.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

*He Du,Bowen Li,Aijun Yang,Siyang He,Qipeng Guo,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal, evolutionary, strategy-guided data synthesis framework for generating verifiable training data for large language models, addressing hallucinations and cross-domain verifiability; improves RLVR and model distillation with domain-general verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifiable data is crucial for stable RL with verifiable rewards and effective distillation across math, coding, and agentic tasks. Current approaches rely on task-specific heuristics and post-hoc filters that fail to generalize; there is a need for a principled, universal evaluator of verifiability and a scalable synthesis process.

Method: An evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data synthesis pipeline that starts from minimal seed supervision to jointly synthesize problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts; iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks.

Result: The synthesized data training regime yields significant improvements on LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks under both RLVR and model distillation paradigms, demonstrating strong generalization across domains.

Conclusion: Turns filtering into principled data synthesis by generating coherent, verifiable training instances without relying on domain-specific rules, enabling robust generalization and transfer across tasks.

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

*Xiangbo Deng,Cheng Chen,Peng Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage Param-CPD framework: learn Bayesian posterior over governing parameters via simulation-based inference, then run CPD on the parameter trajectory; yields improved changepoint detection in Lorenz-63 compared to observation-space baselines, with identifiability, calibration, and robustness results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard due to entangled observation-space signals with intrinsic variability; shifting to a physically interpretable parameter space can provide a cleaner, more detectable signal.

Method: Stage 1: amortize Bayesian inference of governing parameters using a neural posterior estimator trained with simulation-based inference. Stage 2: apply a standard changepoint detection (CPD) algorithm to the inferred parameter trajectory. Eval on Lorenz-63 with piecewise-constant parameters, comparing against observation-space baselines.

Result: Param-CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives vs observation-space baselines. Identifiability and calibration of inferred posteriors demonstrated on stationary trajectories. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise show consistent gains.

Conclusion: Operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

### [117] [Demystifying Transition Matching: When and Why It Can Beat Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17991)
*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TM outperforms FM for finite steps in unimodal Gaussian targets due to stochastic latent updates that preserve covariance, yielding lower KL and faster convergence; in Gaussian mixtures, TM is advantageous in local-unimodality regimes with well-separated components; the advantage diminishes as target variance shrinks, and TM converges to FM in the zero-variance limit. Validated on synthetic Gaussian experiments and extended to image/video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the conditions under which Transition Matching (TM) surpasses Flow Matching (FM) in diffusion-like generative models, with a focus on sampling efficiency and accuracy across different target distributions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of KL divergence between TM and FM for a finite step regime in unimodal Gaussian targets; derivation of convergence rates under fixed compute budgets; extension to Gaussian mixtures via local unimodality approximations and analysis of error decay with component separation; examination of asymptotic behavior as target variance approaches zero; empirical validation on synthetic Gaussian tests and application to image and video generation tasks.

Result: In the unimodal Gaussian setting, TM achieves strictly lower KL than FM for finite steps due to stochastic difference latent updates that preserve target covariance; TM also converges faster under a fixed compute budget. For Gaussian mixtures, TM outperforms FM in local-unimodality regimes where component means are well separated and non-negligible variances; the approximation error relative to the unimodal case decreases with greater separation. As the target variance approaches zero, TM updates converge to FM updates, nullifying the TM advantage. Overall, TM is advantageous when the target has well-separated modes and non-negligible variance; this is supported by controlled Gaussian experiments and extended to real-world image and video generation tasks.

Conclusion: TM offers a practical sampling advantage over FM in regimes with nonzero variance and well-separated modes, guiding when to adopt TM over FM. In near-delta targets, the benefit fades. The results suggest exploring TM for multimodal data with clearly separated components and confirming benefits on larger-scale image/video workloads.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

### [118] [Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering (A-DATSC) Model for multivariate spatiotemporal data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18004)
*Francis Ndikum Nji,Vandana Janeja,Jianwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A-DATSC introduces an attention-guided deep adversarial temporal subspace clustering model for 4D multivariate spatiotemporal data, combining a U-Net–inspired generator with TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers and a graph attention transformer-based self-expressive network, along with a discriminator, achieving superior clustering over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate spatiotemporal data exhibit complex nonlinear manifolds and long-range temporal dependencies. Existing deep subspace clustering methods use shallow autoencoders and neglect local structure, leading to poor clustering on 4D data (e.g., snowmelt, sea ice, crop health). There's a need to preserve spatial-temporal integrity, model local/global dependencies, and handle long-range relationships.

Method: A-DATSC merges a deep subspace clustering generator (U-Net-like with stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers to retain spatial-temporal integrity) with a graph attention transformer-based self-expressive network to capture local spatial relationships, global dependencies, and short/long-range correlations. A quality-verifying discriminator provides adversarial feedback to improve clustering quality. Evaluations on three real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show improved clustering over state-of-the-art deep subspace clustering models.

Result: The method achieves substantially superior clustering performance compared to existing deep subspace clustering models on three real-world datasets.

Conclusion: By addressing shallow encoder limitations, incorporating temporal-spatial preservation, and leveraging graph attention for self-expression under adversarial verification, A-DATSC advances clustering performance on 4D spatiotemporal data and offers a framework adaptable to diverse geospatial-temporal analysis tasks.

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

TL;DR: Eight probabilistic deep learning models (including two foundation models) were evaluated for neural activity forecasting; deep models generally outperformed classical models on mouse cortex widefield data, with the best model forecasting up to 1.5 seconds ahead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between advanced deep forecasting methods and neural activity forecasting, enabling better understanding of temporal structure and potential closed-loop control.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight probabilistic deep learning models (two foundation models) against four classical models and two baselines on spontaneous mouse cortex widefield imaging data; performance assessed across prediction horizons.

Result: Several deep learning models consistently outperform classical approaches across horizons; the top model provides informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future.

Conclusion: Findings support the viability of deep probabilistic forecasting for neural activity, enabling future control applications and deeper investigation of intrinsic temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STONe is a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns cross-domain mappings to forecast unobservable fields from sparse sensor data, enabling long-horizon predictions without domain alignment or recurrence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address forecasting tasks where inputs and targets lie on different physical manifolds and data are sparse/heterogeneous, a setting where traditional operator learners assuming co-located fields and short horizons fail.

Method: Introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable mapping between sensor and target manifolds, trained on long temporal data to enable millisecond inference and 180-day forecasts without iterative recurrence.

Result: STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts of high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron measurements using 23 years of global data, with millisecond inference latency and stable long-horizon performance.

Conclusion: Cross-domain operator inference is viable and generalizes beyond shared-domain settings, enabling real-time prediction of complex spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

### [121] [Measure-Theoretic Anti-Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18052)
*Arman Behnam,Binghui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACIA: a measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning with a two-level design and interventional kernels, achieving strong out-of-distribution generalization without requiring explicit causal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In anti-causal settings where labels generate features, standard approaches face challenges due to environment shifts and interventions. A robust framework is needed to learn stable representations, handle prefect/imperfect interventions, and provide theoretical guarantees for OOD generalization.

Method: ACIA uses a two-level design: (1) low-level representations capture how labels generate observations, and (2) high-level representations learn stable causal patterns across environment-specific variations. It employs interventional kernels to handle prefect and imperfect interventions, does not rely on explicit causal graphs, works with high-dimensional data, and offers theoretical guarantees for OOD generalization.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world medical datasets show ACIA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and invariance metrics. Theoretical analysis provides tight bounds on the performance gap between training and unseen environments, validating robustness of anti-causal learning.

Conclusion: ACIA offers a flexible, theory-backed framework for anti-causal representation learning that addresses prior limitations, enabling robust OOD generalization across environments and interventions.

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

### [122] [Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization for Fine-tuning Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18053)
*Jiajun Fan,Tong Wei,Chaoran Cheng,Yuxin Chen,Ge Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Divergence Regularized Policy Optimization (ADRPO) automatically tunes divergence strength in RL fine-tuning based on advantage estimates, balancing exploration and exploitation across samples and modalities. It uses Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching in generative models and generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning for LLMs and multi-modal reasoning, outperforming fixed-regularization baselines and enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core dilemma in fine-tuning generative models with RL is the trade-off between strong regularization (preserving capabilities) and weak regularization (better reward optimization but risk of instability or reward hacking). There is a need for a method that adapts regularization strength to data quality or sample value to improve learning.

Method: Propose ADRPO: adapt regularization strength based on advantage estimates, reducing regularization for high-value samples and increasing it for poor samples. Implement with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow matching in text-to-image generation. Demonstrates improvements over offline DPO and online methods with fixed regularization (e.g., ORW-CFM-W2). Generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of text-only LLMs and multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing online RL methods like GRPO. Shows emergent exploration capabilities in LLMs and superior reasoning in multimodal tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform larger models in certain benchmarks.

Result: ADRPO achieves better semantic alignment and diversity than offline methods like DPO and online fixed-regularization methods (ORW-CFM-W2) in image generation; a 2B SD3 model surpasses much larger 4.8B and 12B models in attribute binding, semantic consistency, and style transfer while preserving diversity. In LLM and multi-modal tasks, it enables escape from local optima, improves step-by-step reasoning, and allows smaller models (7B) to outperform larger commercial models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o Audio) on specified tasks; generalizes across architectures and modalities.

Conclusion: Adaptive, value-driven regularization offers a plug-and-play solution to the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL fine-tuning. By letting regularization adapt to sample value, ADRPO improves performance, stability, and data efficiency across text-, image-, and multi-modal models, with potential applicability to other KL/Wasserstein-regularized policies.

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

*Wei-Jer Chang,Akshay Rangesh,Kevin Joseph,Matthew Strong,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Yihan Hu,Wei Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPACeR combines a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference to guide decentralized self-play RL, anchoring to human driving via likelihood rewards and KL divergence. It achieves human-like, scalable policies that are fast and compact, competitive with imitation methods and enabling fast planner evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieve human-like, safe, and predictable autonomous-vehicle policies at scale. Imitation/diffusion-based models are realistic but slow and hard to adapt in closed-loop; pure self-play RL scales but risks drifting from human norms. A hybrid approach aims to preserve realism while maintaining efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Use a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy within decentralized self-play RL. The reference provides likelihood-based rewards and KL-divergence penalties to anchor agents to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability.

Result: On the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, SPACeR matches imitation-learned policies in performance while offering up to 10x faster inference and 50x smaller parameter counts than large generative models. Closed-loop ego planning tasks show the approach can effectively measure planner quality with fast, scalable traffic simulation.

Conclusion: SPACeR demonstrates a practical bridge between imitation and RL for autonomous driving, delivering human-aligned, scalable policies and a new paradigm for planner evaluation through fast traffic simulation.

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Motivation: To address credit assignment and instability when fine-tuning continuous-time flow models with rewards, and to improve robustness and diversity beyond regression-based critics.

Method: Introduce reward shaping for normalized intermediate learning signals; a dual-stability mechanism combining advantage clipping with a warm-up period for the critic; scalable generalized critic weighting via Wasserstein regularization to preserve diversity; evaluated on flow-based text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion 3).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art text-to-image alignment and generalizes to unseen human preference models; enables robust finetuning with a computationally efficient critic without sacrificing quality, diversity, or stability.

Conclusion: AC-Flow offers a practical, scalable actor-critic approach for fine-tuning flow-based generative models, addressing credit assignment, instability, and diversity, with strong empirical performance and generalization potential.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

### [125] [Provably Optimal Reinforcement Learning under Safety Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18082)
*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Permissive safety filters can guarantee safety without sacrificing asymptotic RL performance, by formalizing safety via SC-MDP and a corresponding filtered MDP; the policy optimal in the filtered MDP, when executed through the same filter, matches the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, separating safety from learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns limit RL in safety-critical tasks. Prior work treats safety filtering as a performance-cost; this work provides formal guarantees that safety filtering need not hinder learning, by introducing a framework where safety is enforced categorically and decoupled from optimization.

Method: Define a safety-critical MDP (SC-MDP) with categorical avoidance of catastrophic states and a filtered MDP where a safety filter ensures all actions have safe effects. Prove a main theorem showing: (i) safe learning in the filtered MDP, (ii) standard RL convergence carries over in the filtered MDP, (iii) any policy optimal in the filtered MDP (when run through the same filter) achieves the same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP. Validate with Safety Gymnasium experiments showing zero violations during training and competitive final performance.

Result: The core theorem yields three guarantees: safe learning, preserved RL convergence, and asymptotic performance parity between the filtered-MDP optimum (via the filter) and the best safe policy in the SC-MDP. Empirically, safety violations are zero during training, and final performance matches or exceeds unfiltered baselines in Safety Gymnasium tasks.

Conclusion: Safety enforcement and learning can be completely separated. Use the most permissive safety filter available to train and deploy RL policies, providing a principled recipe for safe RL in safety-critical settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

### [126] [R2L: Reliable Reinforcement Learning: Guaranteed Return & Reliable Policies in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18074)
*Nadir Farhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A state-augmented reliable RL framework that Maximizes the probability of meeting a cumulative return threshold, enabling standard RL methods (Q-learning, DDQN) to provide performance guarantees; demonstrated on reliable routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world, safety-critical and stochastic settings, high average return is insufficient; we need guarantees on achieving a target performance with high probability, e.g., timely routing under uncertainty.

Method: Introduce a state-augmented reformulation of the RL problem that targets the probability that the cumulative return exceeds a threshold. Prove equivalence to a standard RL formulation. Adapt existing methods (Q-learning, Dueling Double DQN) to derive reliable policies. Apply to a reliable routing task and validate with experiments.

Result: Theoretical results establish the equivalence between the reliable reformulation and standard RL; empirical studies show policies that balance efficiency and reliability, achieving higher probability of meeting the time budget in routing scenarios.

Conclusion: Reliable RL can be achieved by a state-augmented approach, allowing use of established RL algorithms to provide probabilistic performance guarantees in stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A public, multi-modal dataset from 119 lab-scale batch distillation experiments (fault-free and anomalous) for ML-based anomaly detection, including time-series sensor data, NMR, video/audio, and ontology-based anomaly annotations, enabling interpretable ML and anomaly mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scarcity of openly available experimental data for ML-driven anomaly detection in chemical processes, enabling training, evaluation, and interpretable analysis.

Method: Built a lab-scale batch distillation plant, conducted 119 experiments across conditions; collected time-series sensor/actuator data with uncertainty estimates; added NMR, video, and audio data; developed an ontology for anomaly annotations; organized data in a structured database and released publicly (Zenodo DOI).

Result: Released a comprehensive, multi-modal anomaly dataset with extensive metadata and annotations, facilitating ML method development, evaluation, and interpretability; includes anomaly causes for explainability and mitigation studies.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable resource to advance ML-based anomaly detection in chemical processing, promoting interpretable ML and potential anomaly mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

*Rukuang Huang,Sungjun Cho,Chetan Gohil,Oiwi Parker Jones,Mark Woolrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEG-GPT is a transformer-based foundation model for MEG data that uses time-attention and a novel data-driven tokeniser to preserve temporal resolution, enabling realistic data generation, robust zero-shot generalization across sessions and subjects, and effective fine-tuning for cross-subject decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of capturing rich spatiotemporal structure in MEG signals and to leverage foundation-model scale to improve brain data modeling, decoding, and generalization.

Method: Develop MEG-GPT, a transformer with time-attention trained on tokenised brain region time-courses from Cam-CAN MEG data (N=612, eyes-closed rest). Introduce a continuous, data-driven tokeniser that preserves temporal resolution without lossy transformations. Evaluate generated data for spatio-spectral realism, test zero-shot decoding across sessions and subjects, and demonstrate efficient fine-tuning on smaller labelled datasets for cross-subject decoding.

Result: Generated data exhibits realistic spatio-spectral properties including transient events and population variability; zero-shot decoding improves from 0.54 to 0.59 across sessions and from 0.41 to 0.49 across subjects; model can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets to boost cross-subject decoding.

Conclusion: MEG-GPT establishes a foundation model for electrophysiological data, enabling improved neural decoding and providing a scalable framework for computational neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

### [129] [Any-Depth Alignment: Unlocking Innate Safety Alignment of LLMs to Any-Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18081)
*Jiawei Zhang,Andrew Estornell,David D. Baek,Bo Li,Xiaojun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADA is an inference-time defense that injects assistant header tokens mid-generation to re-evaluate harmfulness, achieving near-100% refusals against long adversarial prefill, and reducing adversarial prompt attack success to under 3% across multiple open-source model families, with negligible overhead and preserved benign utility, even after instruction-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong but shallow alignment: they refuse harmful queries at the start but safety collapses as generation depth increases or under adversarial prompts. A lightweight, parameter-free defense is needed to enforce safety at arbitrary generation depths. Alignment appears concentrated in assistant header tokens due to shallow-refusal training, suggesting reusing these priors mid-stream could restore refusals.

Method: ADA operates at inference time by reintroducing the model’s perceived header tokens mid-generation to trigger a reassessment of harmfulness. It leverages the model’s existing alignment priors without modifying parameters. It has been evaluated across diverse open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss).

Result: ADA yields near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill attacks (ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens). It also reduces the success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP) to under 3%. Benign task utility is preserved with minimal over-refusal, and the resilience persists after subsequent instruction tuning (benign or adversarial).

Conclusion: ADA provides a practical, generalizable, and lightweight solution to extend LLM safety to arbitrary generation depths without changing model parameters, maintaining utility while significantly strengthening robustness to long-horizon attacks. Further work could explore token selection and coverage to broaden defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

### [130] [Enhancing mortality prediction in cardiac arrest ICU patients through meta-modeling of structured clinical data from MIMIC-IV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18103)
*Nursultan Mamatov,Philipp Kellmeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating structured ICU data with unstructured notes (discharge summaries, radiology reports) via TF-IDF and BERT improves in-hospital mortality prediction (AUC 0.918) over structured data alone (AUC 0.753).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate mortality risk stratification is critical for ICU management; unstructured clinical notes may contain complementary prognostic signals not captured by structured data.

Method: Use MIMIC-IV data; feature selection by LASSO and XGBoost on structured features; train multivariate logistic regression on top features; incorporate textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings; evaluate with AUC and decision curve analysis.

Result: Final model with structured + textual input achieves AUC 0.918; structured-alone AUC 0.753; relative improvement ~22%; decision curve indicates higher net benefit across thresholds 0.2-0.8.

Conclusion: Unstructured clinical notes add prognostic value in ICU mortality prediction; integrating text data into interpretable risk models enhances predictive performance and clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

### [131] [Latent Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18114)
*Dario Shariatian,Alain Durmus,Stefano Peluchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) combine masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings to preserve joint structure and improve few-step generation. Two variants, FUJI-LDDMs (fully joint denoising of tokens and latents) and SEQ-LDDMs (sequential latent then discrete denoising), are proposed. They use ELBO-style objectives and learn informative yet diffusion-friendly latents. Empirically, LDDMs improve unconditional generation metrics over masked discrete diffusion baselines and perform well at low sampling budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked denoisers for discrete diffusion typically factorize reverse transitions across positions, which weakens joint structure and hurts quality in few-step generation. A latent diffusion channel can provide softer signals and carry cross-token dependencies to resolve ambiguities.

Method: Introduce Latent Discrete Diffusion Models (LDDMs) that couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. Two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs performing fully joint denoising of tokens and latents; (ii) SEQ-LDDMs that sequentially resolve the latent then the discrete chain conditioned on it. Derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn informative latents amenable to diffusion modeling.

Result: Empirical results show LDDMs yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics over state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines and are effective at lower sampling budgets where many tokens are unmasked per step.

Conclusion: LDDMs provide a principled way to inject cross-token dependencies via latent diffusion into discrete text diffusion, offering improved generation quality and sampling efficiency, with two viable instantiations (FUJI-LDDMs and SEQ-LDDMs) depending on whether joint or sequential denoising is used.

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

### [132] [Gradient Variance Reveals Failure Modes in Flow-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18118)
*Teodora Reu,Sixtine Dromigny,Michael Bronstein,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rectified Flows' straight-path objective can memorize training pairings under deterministic training, hurting generalization; introducing noise restores generalization. The paper analyzes gradient-variance-driven biases and proves memorizing vector fields exist, with theory supported by CelebA experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why the straight-path objective in Rectified Flows leads to memorization and poor generalization, especially when interpolants cross, and to identify regimes (deterministic vs stochastic) that bias the learned vector field.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport; study of gradient variance across stochastic/deterministic regimes; characterization of vector-field objectives; proof of memorization-field existence in intersecting interpolant settings; demonstration that inference reproduces training pairings under deterministic integration; empirical validation on CelebA comparing deterministic versus noisy interpolation to assess generalization.

Result: Identification of fundamental failure modes: memorization of training pairings when gradients have low variance in deterministic training; in certain intersecting interpolant configurations, Rectified Flows recovers training pairings at inference; a memorizing vector field exists even with intersecting interpolants; small noise injection during training restores generalization; empirical CelebA results confirm theory.

Conclusion: The straight-path objective can severely limit generalization by inducing memorization; incorporating stochasticity (noise) in training mitigates memorization and improves generalization; these findings suggest redesigns in Rectified Flows to avoid memorization and further study to understand vector-field behavior under different transport geometries.

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Core attention disaggregation (CAD) decouples the core attention computation from the rest of the model and runs it on dedicated servers, improving long-context LLM training throughput and resource balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context LLM training suffers from the core attention's quadratic compute growth at large context lengths, causing load imbalance and stragglers; however, core attention is stateless and composable, enabling separation and efficient scheduling.

Method: Partition core attention into token-level tasks dispatched to dedicated attention servers; use dynamic rebatching to equalize compute; implement a ping-pong execution scheme to overlap communication with computation and perform in-place execution on attention servers (DistCA).

Result: End-to-end training throughput improves up to 1.35x on 512 GPUs with contexts up to 512k tokens; data and pipeline stragglers are eliminated and compute/memory balance approaches perfection.

Conclusion: CAD via DistCA demonstrates that decoupling core attention yields scalable, balanced long-context training and mitigates stragglers without sacrificing kernel efficiency.

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyDiF reframes 3D molecular conformers as continuous directional fields (MDFs) generated by molecule-conditioned neural fields (MNFs) via a hypernetwork and diffusion training, enabling generation, inpainting, and fine-grained property prediction while scaling to large biomolecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of discrete coordinate/graph representations for molecules by adopting a continuous, field-based description that supports generative modeling, cross-molecule generalization, and localized feature extraction for property prediction, with scalability to larger biomolecules.

Method: Define Molecular Directional Fields (MDFs) as vector fields mapping space to the direction toward the nearest atom of a given type. Represent MDFs with molecule-specific neural implicit fields (MNFs). Use a molecule-conditioned hypernetwork to generate MNF weights for each molecule, enabling shared learning across molecules. Train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion model to sample in function space. Introduce a masked diffusion variant to enable structure-conditioned generation (e.g., inpainting) by selectively noising field regions. Leverage MDFs for spatially fine-grained feature extraction for property prediction.

Result: The framework enables diffusion-based generation in the space of molecular fields, supports structure-conditioned tasks like inpainting, and yields localized field representations that improve molecular property prediction. Demonstrates scalability to larger biomolecules, suggesting practicality for field-based molecular modeling.

Conclusion: Field-based molecular modeling via HyDiF offers a continuous, localized, and generative representation that unifies generation and analysis tasks, and appears promising for scalable, field-centric modeling of complex biomolecules.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DC-based reexamination of PCA that yields kernelizable, out-of-sample PCA variants, links simultaneous iteration to DCA, introduces new PCA algorithms, and a kernelizable dual for a robust l1-PCA variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of PCA by applying the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, inspired by links between self-attention and kernel PCA, and to enable kernelization, out-of-sample applicability, and robust variants.

Method: Formulate PCA-like problems within the DC (difference-of-convex) framework, derive kernelizable and out-of-sample versions, show simultaneous iteration is an instance of DCA, develop new PCA algorithms, and present a kernelizable dual for a robust l1-deviation PCA variant.

Result: Establish kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for PCA-like problems; reveal that simultaneous iteration corresponds to DCA; propose new PCA algorithms; provide a kernelizable dual formulation for a robust l1-PCA variant and empirical comparisons.

Conclusion: A DC-centric view of PCA yields theoretical insights, enabling kernelized, robust PCA formulations and practical algorithms, and situates classical methods (like simultaneous iteration) within the DCA framework.

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

TL;DR: A robust, regularization-based approach for finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information, two-player zero-sum games that stays stable with large fixed regularization and updates a reference policy; yields a practical Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG) that converges to Nash and scales to large games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regularization-based methods can guarantee last-iteration convergence but require shrinking reg to zero to approximate Nash, which causes unstable learning in practice. There is a need for a robust algorithm that converges to Nash without tiny regularization and scales to large, imperfect-information games.

Method: Fix a large regularization strength and iteratively refine the reference policy to guarantee monotone improvement. Prove that this procedure converges to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games without assuming uniqueness. Build Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG) that relies only on current and reference policies, preserving policy-gradient generality and model-free applicability.

Result: Theoretical guarantee of strictly monotone improvement and convergence to exact Nash in two-player zero-sum games. Empirical results show NashPG achieves comparable or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic games and scales to Battleship and No-Limit Texas Hold’em, attaining higher Elo ratings.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust, convergent approach to Nash equilibria in imposter-information two-player zero-sum games, with NashPG offering a practical, scalable, and model-free policy-gradient algorithm that leverages fixed regularization and reference-policy refinement to reach exact Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AR embeds explicit logical reasoning into LLM latent space via a three-stage process, enabling transparent, controllable, and scalable reasoning across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are opaque; SAEs offer some interpretability but are brittle and passive; need a framework to induce and control reasoning within latent representations.

Method: Stage 1. Identify latent concepts (e.g., via sparse autoencoders) and build a dictionary. Stage 2. At inference, detect activating concepts and map to logical propositions. Stage 3. Apply logical rules over propositions to derive higher-order structures, compose new concepts, and steer behavior.

Result: Across multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction/robustness (Rail2Country), ProverQA, BeaverTails, AR shows scaling with reasoning complexity, generalization to abstract/context-sensitive tasks, and transfer across backbones; improves transparency, structured reasoning, and controllable alignment.

Conclusion: Grounding logical structure in latent activations offers a path to more reliable, auditable AI with scalable reasoning and model control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

*Jostein Barry-Straume,Adwait D. Verulkar,Arash Sarshar,Andrey A. Popov,Adrian Sandu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stabilizer-free PINN-based multistage ensemble framework learns the HJB cost-to-go and corresponding optimal control for an infinite-horizon, noisy two-state nonlinear system, enabling both singular and ensemble control in closed-loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HJB provides a principled way to design optimal controllers but is computationally intractable and often lacks analytical solutions. PINNs offer a physics-guided route, but prior work relies on stabilizing terms. This work aims to remove stabilizers and enable robust control under noise and varying initial conditions.

Method: Introduce a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go (value function) and derive the corresponding optimal control via the HJB equation. The approach supports either a singular learned control signal or an ensemble control policy, and is evaluated in closed-loop on a steady-state time-invariant two-state nonlinear system with infinite horizon, under noisy perturbed states and varying initial conditions.

Result: The method achieves successful closed-loop control using both ensemble- and singular-control, demonstrating robustness to measurement noise and initial-condition variability in the tested two-state system.

Conclusion: A stabilizer-free PINN framework can approximate the HJB solution and produce flexible control signals (singular or ensemble) for infinite-horizon, noisy nonlinear systems, broadening the practical applicability of PINN-based optimal control.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical MARL framework for covert, energy-aware multi-AUV cooperation: macro-level task allocation via MDP with PPO; micro-level Dec-POMDP with multi-agent PPO for trajectory/power control; centralized training with decentralized execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance cooperation efficiency and communication covertness in underwater missions while respecting energy and mobility constraints.

Method: Formulate joint trajectory and power optimization. Macro level: master AUV uses Markov decision process and proximal policy optimization for strategic task allocation. Micro level: selected agents solve decentralized Dec-POMDPs, using multi-agent proximal policy optimization to adjust trajectories and transmission power based on local observations. Centralized training with decentralized execution.

Result: Provides theoretical insights and practical solutions for efficient and secure operation of multiple AUVs, enabling adaptive covert cooperation under energy and mobility constraints with implications for underwater covert communication tasks.

Conclusion: A hierarchical MARL framework with centralized training and decentralized execution effectively supports energy-aware, covert cooperative sensing/detection among AUVs, balancing performance and stealth.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

*Zhendong Mi,Qitao Tan,Grace Li Zhang,Zhaozhuo Xu,Geng Yuan,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P-GAP uses projected gradient-aligned perturbations in a low-dimensional gradient space to reduce variance and accelerate zeroth-order LLM fine-tuning, yielding higher accuracy with far fewer iterations and less GPU time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is appealing for LLM fine-tuning due to lower memory usage, but suffers from high gradient-variance and slow convergence on large models. There is a need for scalable, efficient ZO fine-tuning methods for LLMs.

Method: Estimate a low-dimensional gradient subspace and align perturbations with gradients within this projected space. This reduces the number of perturbed parameters and lowers variance, enabling faster convergence in ZO LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements over baselines: up to 6% higher accuracy on classification tasks and up to 12% on generation tasks, with up to 81% fewer training iterations and 70% less GPU hours.

Conclusion: P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient zeroth-order fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces ACTG-ARL: a two-stage, DP-aware architecture that decouples feature learning from conditional generation and uses Anchored RL to improve instruction-following, delivering higher-quality DP synthetic text and finer-grained generation control (≈+20% MAUVE vs prior work).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate high-quality synthetic data under differential privacy that preserves key statistical attributes, minimizes utility loss from DP noise, and offers fine-grained control over generation.

Method: Hierarchical framework: feature learning with a rich tabular schema, a DP tabular synthesizer to generate features, and a DP fine-tuned conditional generator for text conditioned on features. ARL: post-training Anchored RL, combining RL for control with a supervised fine-tuning anchor on best-of-N data to avoid reward hacking. End-to-end ACTG-ARL pipeline.

Result: Achieves ~20% MAUVE improvement vs prior DP synthesis methods; improves instruction-following ability and conditional generation control under strong DP guarantees.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL advances DP synthetic text quality and controllability, validating a practical end-to-end approach for privacy-preserving NLP data generation, balancing utility and privacy.

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

*Bryan Wilder,Angela Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Argues for expanding what counts as social impact in ML for social good and for rigorous evaluation of deployed systems, warning that current review criteria overvalue deployment plus methodological novelty and risk harming the research ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current review guidelines reward projects that both deploy ML and introduce novel methods, which creates incentives undermining a diverse, sustainable ecosystem that also values single-front contributions (applied or methodological).

Method: Conceptual/ normative analysis advocating two shifts: (1) broaden the definition of social impact beyond mere deployment, and (2) require rigorous, real-world evaluation of deployed systems.

Result: If adopted, review practices would reward a wider range of contributions (applied and methodological) and promote a healthier, more sustainable research ecosystem in ML for social impact.

Conclusion: Researchers and reviewers should embrace an expansive notion of social impact and implement rigorous post-deployment evaluation to better meet partner needs and advance the field.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

### [143] [Learning with Dual-level Noisy Correspondence for Multi-modal Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18240)
*Haobin Li,Yijie Lin,Peng Hu,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RULE, a robust framework for multi-modal entity alignment under Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC). It estimates reliabilities of intra-entity (entity-attribute) and inter-graph (entity-entity, attribute-attribute) correspondences to mitigate noise, uses reliabilities to fuse attributes and prune noisy inter-graph matches, and adds a correspondence reasoning module to reveal cross-graph attribute-attribute links, achieving better matching under DNC. Evaluated on five benchmarks with seven SOTA baselines; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real MMKGs, annotations introduce noise; existing MMEA methods assume clean correspondences, neglecting dual-level noise; DNC affecting both intra-entity and inter-graph alignments is practical and under-explored.

Method: A two-fold reliability estimation for both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences; reliability-guided attribute fusion and discrepancy elimination; a correspondence reasoning module to uncover attribute-attribute connections across graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show RULE outperforms seven SOTA methods under DNC; robust to noisy correspondences; code released.

Conclusion: RULE demonstrates a robust solution to DNC in MMEA by integrating reliability estimation, noise-aware fusion, and cross-graph reasoning, enhancing correct entity resolution in heterogeneous MMKGs.

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

### [144] [Scaling Laws Meet Model Architecture: Toward Inference-Efficient LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18245)
*Song Bian,Tao Yu,Shivaram Venkataraman,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conditional scaling law that apps architectural information (hidden size, mlp-to-attention ratio, and grouped-query attention) to the scaling framework to identify inference-efficient, accurate LLM architectures. Trains 200+ models (80M–3B params; 8B–100B tokens) and shows optimized architectures outperform baselines under the same budget, with up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% faster inference than LLaMA-3.2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs scale, inference cost becomes a critical bottleneck. Existing scaling laws focus on parameter count and data but neglect architectural choices that impact latency and throughput. The work aims to integrate architecture into the scaling framework and discover architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Extend the Chinchilla scaling framework with architectural information to form a conditional scaling law. Propose a search framework over architectural factors—hidden size, mlp-to-attention ratio, and grouped-query attention (GQA)—to identify cost-efficient, accurate models. Train over 200 models spanning 80M–3B parameters and 8B–100B tokens to fit the law.

Result: The conditional scaling law reliably predicts architectural choices that optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater inference throughput than LLaMA-3.2 under the same training budget, and outperform existing open-source baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating architectural factors into a scaling law enables simultaneous gains in accuracy and inference efficiency, providing a practical path to deployable, cost-efficient LLMs.

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTKMTL introduces an extended Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for multi-task learning, using spectral analysis to balance task convergence speeds and mitigate task imbalance, with a shared-representation variant (NTKMTL-SR) for efficiency; achieves state-of-the-art across multi-task supervised learning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task imbalance and varied convergence speeds across tasks hinder generalization in multi-task learning. Leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel theory can illuminate training dynamics and guide principled balancing of tasks.

Method: Extend NTK to a multi-task setting with an expanded NTK matrix; apply spectral analysis to balance convergence speeds among tasks; propose NTKMTL-SR that relies on shared representations to improve training efficiency.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks in both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task reinforcement learning, with the SR variant offering efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: NTK-informed balancing provides a principled approach to mitigating task imbalance in MTL. The shared-representation variant offers a more efficient training pipeline without sacrificing accuracy, and the methods demonstrate strong generalization across domains; code is available online.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Customized-GRPO with SARS and TDW improves fidelity-editability in subject-driven image generation by nonlinearly shaping rewards and aligning optimization with diffusion dynamics; outperforms naive GRPO baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a fundamental trade-off between identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability) in subject-driven image generation. Naive online RL with simple, static reward aggregation causes conflicting gradients and misalignment with the diffusion process's temporal dynamics.

Method: Introduce SARS (Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping), a nonlinear reward mechanism that penalizes conflicting signals and amplifies synergistic ones; introduce TDW (Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting), which shifts optimization pressure from early prompt-following to later identity preservation to match diffusion dynamics; integrate these into Customized-GRPO.

Result: Empirical results show substantial improvements over naive GRPO baselines, mitigating competitive degradation and achieving images that better balance preserving key identity features with adhering to complex prompts.

Conclusion: The Customized-GRPO framework effectively addresses the fidelity-editability trade-off in diffusion-based subject-driven generation. SARS and TDW offer a principled approach for RL-based diffusion optimization, with potential for broader application, though further work on ablations, datasets, and efficiency could be explored.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT) that uses latent variables to tighten Bayes risk under distribution shifts; provides identifiability-based guarantees and a model-agnostic blueprint with a temporal decoder and two noise estimators; validated on synthetic and benchmark data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting with online time series under unknown, time-varying distributions; latent factors influence how historical data map to future observations, requiring theoretical guarantees and practical methods to incorporate latent information.

Method: Develop TOT as a theoretical framework for online forecasting; prove that incorporating latent variables tightens Bayes risk and that the benefit persists under estimation uncertainty and grows with identifiability; propose latent-variable identification using minimal adjacent observations; present a model-agnostic blueprint using a temporal decoder to match observed distributions and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and the mixing of observed variables.

Result: Establish theoretical guarantees: latent variables tighten Bayes risk; benefits persist under estimation uncertainty and increase as identifiability improves; provide a practical identification approach using minimal adjacent observations; deliver a model-agnostic blueprint with a temporal decoder and two noise estimators; empirical validation on synthetic data supports theory; plug-in implementations on baselines yield improvements across benchmarks.

Conclusion: TOT offers a principled framework for online time-series forecasting under distribution shifts, with identifiability-driven gains and a practical, model-agnostic blueprint that improves performance in synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

*Hao Qin,Thang Duong,Ming Li,Chicheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two physics-informed bandit algorithms (pretc and prgreedy) exploit sparse multipath in mmWave channels to improve beam alignment/tracking, outperforming unimodality-based methods across synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam alignment in mmWave faces large beam spaces and unreliable reward structures; unimodal/multimodal assumptions often fail in practice, causing suboptimal beam selection. A robust, data-efficient approach leveraging sparse multipath is needed.

Method: Treat path parameters as black boxes and maintain estimates of their rewards. Propose pretc (random exploration then commit to the best beam) and prgreedy (online estimation with greedy beam choice). Both are physics-informed and connect to the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem, and can be adapted for mobility (beam tracking). Experiments use synthetic DeepMIMO and real DeepSense6G datasets.

Result: Both algorithms outperform existing approaches across diverse channel environments, demonstrating robustness, generalizability, and improved data efficiency in beam alignment/tracking.

Conclusion: Physics-informed, sparsity-aware bandits offer a practical solution for mmWave beam alignment/tracking, overcoming limitations of unimodality-based methods and easily extending to mobile scenarios.

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

### [149] [Towards Identifiability of Hierarchical Temporal Causal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18310)
*Zijian Li,Minghao Fu,Junxian Huang,Yifan Shen,Ruichu Cai,Yuewen Sun,Guangyi Chen,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHiLD identifies hierarchical latent dynamics from three contextually independent observations, enabling joint-distribution recovery across layers and a variational, flow-based temporal model with contextual encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture multi-level temporal dependencies in time-series data and overcome identifiability gaps where single-timestep observations can't recover joint distributions of hierarchical latents.

Method: Theoretically prove identifiability from three conditionally independent observations; use temporal contextual observables to recover multi-layer latent joint distribution; exploit hierarchical sparsity to assign latent variables within layers; implement a time-series generative model with a contextual encoder and normalizing-flow priors enforcing independent noise across layers.

Result: Theoretical identifiability is validated; empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world data show CHiLD effectively models hierarchical latent dynamics.

Conclusion: CHiLD advances causal hierarchical latent dynamic identifiability and modeling, offering a practical, identifiable VAE-like framework for multi-layer temporal latent structures, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

### [150] [Higher Embedding Dimension Creates a Stronger World Model for a Simple Sorting Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18315)
*Brady Bhalla,Honglu Fan,Nancy Chen,Tony Yue YU*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Embedding dimension boosts internal world-model quality and interpretability in RL-trained transformers on an algorithmic task; small dims suffice for accuracy, but larger dims improve structured representations via two robust mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether transformer-based agents learn structured internal representations (world models) and how embedding size affects them in a concrete algorithmic task under reinforcement learning.

Method: Train transformers with RL to perform bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps; systematically vary embedding dimension; analyze internal representations via attention matrices and alignment of transpositions; conduct hundreds of experiments; release metrics for probing similar tasks.

Result: Accuracy remains high across embedding dims; larger dims yield more faithful, consistent, robust internal representations; two mechanisms emerge: last row of attention encodes global token ordering; selected transposition matches the largest adjacent difference in encoded values; model size enhances representation quality in addition to end performance.

Conclusion: Embedding dimension influences the quality of internal world models; bigger models provide better representation fidelity and interpretability; provides quantitative metrics to probe algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

### [151] [Uncertainty Estimation by Flexible Evidential Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18322)
*Taeseong Yoon,Heeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes flexible evidential deep learning (F-EDL) that generalizes EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities to improve uncertainty quantification (UQ).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDL relies on a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities, which can be too restrictive and limit robustness in complex or unseen scenarios. A more expressive uncertainty model is needed for reliable UQ in high-stakes settings.

Method: Extend EDL by predicting parameters of a flexible Dirichlet distribution (a generalization of Dirichlet) for class probabilities, enabling a more adaptive uncertainty representation. The paper provides theoretical advantages and empirical validation.

Result: The approach yields state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: F-EDL offers a more expressive and adaptive uncertainty representation, improving UQ generalization and reliability in challenging scenarios without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

### [152] [Scalable, Explainable and Provably Robust Anomaly Detection with One-Step Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18328)
*Zhong Li,Qi Huang,Yuxuan Zhu,Lincen Yang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri,Niki van Stein,Matthijs van Leeuwen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM) is a lightweight, scalable semi-supervised anomaly detector for tabular data that uses time-conditioned contraction toward the origin to learn velocity fields, enabling fast one-step scoring, explainability, and robustness, with strong results on ADBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient, scalable anomaly detection in high-dimensional tabular data. Existing flow matching and diffusion-based models are computationally heavy and have costly inference. A method that is fast, explainable, and robust is desirable.

Method: Predict a time-conditioned contraction vector toward the origin at each sampled time step; learns velocity fields between distributions without solving ODEs during training/inference; introduces a one-step deviation scoring mechanism for fast anomaly scoring; operates in input space for direct feature-wise attribution; score is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to input, enabling theoretical robustness guarantees.

Result: On the ADBench benchmark, TCCM achieves a favorable accuracy–inference cost balance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on high-dimensional and large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: TCCM offers a practical, scalable, and robust semi-supervised anomaly detection approach for tabular data, with explainability and theoretical robustness guarantees, presenting a lightweight alternative to diffusion/flow-based models and providing accessible source code.

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

### [153] [Why Policy Gradient Algorithms Work for Undiscounted Total-Reward MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18340)
*Jongmin Lee,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends policy gradient analysis to undiscounted, infinite-horizon MDPs (gamma=1) by classifying states into recurrent/transient in a policy-invariant way and introducing a transient visitation measure as a replacement for the ill-defined classical visitation measure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theory largely assumes discounting (gamma<1); policy optimization for large-language-models often uses undiscounted total rewards (gamma=1), leaving a gap in theoretical guarantees and understanding.

Method: Show that, with policies that assign positive probability to all actions (softmax), the dichotomy of recurrent vs. transient states is invariant across such policies; introduce a transient visitation measure to replace the standard state visitation measure that is ill-defined when gamma=1; develop policy-gradient analyses based on these constructs.

Result: Provided theoretical analyses of policy gradient methods for undiscounted infinite-horizon MDPs using the invariant recurrent/transient state classification and the transient visitation measure, enabling gradient-based optimization in the gamma=1 setting.

Conclusion: The work enables applying policy gradient methods to undiscounted gamma=1 problems by re-framing state visitation with a robust transient visitation measure and establishing policy-invariant state classifications, thus extending convergence guarantees and theory to undiscounted RL contexts.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

### [154] [Computable universal online learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18352)
*Dariusz Kalociński,Tomasz Steifer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Separates existence of universal online learners from computable ones; provides exact characterizations for agnostic computable universal online learning and proper computable universal online learning; refines the theory of online binary classification by incorporating computability constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge learning theory with computation by asking not just whether learning is possible, but whether it can be implemented as an algorithm. The work addresses a gap where prior results treat abstract learning without computability considerations, especially in universal online learning.

Method: Theoretically analyzes the universal online learning framework (as characterized by Bousquet et al., STOC'21). Introduces computable variants, proves non-implication results (universal online learning does not imply computable universal online learning), and derives exact necessary and sufficient conditions for agnostic computable universal online learning and for proper computable universal online learning.

Result: Demonstrates a separation between non-Computable and computable universal online learning; provides precise characterizations (exact conditions) for learnability in the agnostic computable setting and in the proper computable setting.

Conclusion: The findings offer a more realistic perspective on online binary classification and inductive inference by highlighting the role of computability, clarifying which learning guarantees survive when programs must be computable.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

*Firas Gabetni,Giuseppe Curci,Andrea Pilzer,Subhankar Roy,Elisa Ricci,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra Ensembles create diverse transformer ensemble members by pruning attention heads and merging them with a novel grouped multi-head attention. This yields substantial UQ performance close to Deep Ensembles but with near-single-model inference speed and no retraining, plus strong calibration and state-of-the-art zero-shot results on ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Ensembles offer strong uncertainty quantification but incur high computational and memory costs, limiting scalability for large models and safety-critical applications. The work aims to achieve scalable, well-calibrated UQ without prohibitive overhead.

Method: Prune attention heads within transformer models to form diverse ensemble members. Merge these heads using a new multi-head attention mechanism with grouped fully-connected layers to produce a compact, efficient ensemble. No retraining from scratch is required; includes an analysis showing naive pruning harms calibration.

Result: Hydra Ensembles deliver UQ performance that matches or surpasses Deep Ensembles while maintaining inference speed close to a single network. They preserve robust calibration and show consistent gains across image and text tasks; zero-shot ImageNet-1k classification surpasses state-of-the-art methods without additional training.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles offer an efficient, scalable approach to uncertainty quantification in transformers, achieving ensemble-like UQ quality with negligible speed/memory overhead and strong calibration, with potential for deployment in safety-critical settings and strong zero-shot capabilities.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

*Sunwoo Kim,Hyunjin Hwang,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGP is a pre-training approach for neural architecture encoders that learns to reconstruct a flow surrogate of information flow, achieving large gains over purely supervised training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model performance depends on architecture; identifying architectures quickly and accurately is challenging. Existing flow-based encoders are slow due to their specialized structures, motivating a faster pre-training alternative.

Method: Propose FGP: pre-train an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate that represents the neural architecture's information flow, reducing reliance on specialized flow-based models; followed by task-specific supervised fine-tuning.

Result: FGP improves encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision@1 over the same encoder trained with supervised learning alone.

Conclusion: FGP enables faster, more accurate neural-architecture encoding by capturing information flow without specialized encoder structures, enhancing NAS efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

### [157] [Towards Unsupervised Open-Set Graph Domain Adaptation via Dual Reprogramming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18363)
*Zhen Zhang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphRTA introduces unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation via joint graph and model reprogramming to handle unseen target classes and reduce source bias, achieving competitive results with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world graphs, target domains may contain classes not present in the source. Closed-set GDA cannot recognize these unseen classes, motivating open-set GDA and robust transfer across graphs.

Method: GraphRTA performs graph reprogramming by modifying the target graph structure and node features to better separate known vs unknown classes, and model reprogramming by pruning domain-specific parameters to reduce source bias while retaining transferable patterns. The classifier is extended with an unknown-class dimension to avoid manually tuned thresholds for open-set recognition.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show competitive performance against recent state-of-the-art baselines, and the paper provides publicly available code and datasets.

Conclusion: GraphRTA effectively tackles unsupervised open-set graph domain adaptation through joint graph and model reprogramming, enabling better separation of known/unknown classes and reducing source bias, with demonstrated practical utility.

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic empirical study of expert diversification for GNN ensembles (MoE) across 14 benchmarks, evaluating 20 strategies and 200+ ensembles; provides guidance for training diverse GNN experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs are heterogeneous; a single GNN’s performance is limited by this heterogeneity. Mixture-of-Experts can improve performance by combining diverse GNNs, but there is a need for a systematic evaluation of diversification techniques to maximize diversity and complementarity.

Method: Evaluate 20 diversification strategies (random re-initialization, hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, training data partitioning) across 14 node classification benchmarks; construct and analyze over 200 GNN ensemble variants; assess expert diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance; derive mechanistic insights into training maximally diverse experts; provide actionable guidance; code: repository link.

Result: Comprehensive empirical mapping of how diversification strategies affect diversity, complementarity, and ensemble performance in GNN MoEs; identification of strategies that most effectively increase ensemble accuracy; mechanistic insights into how to train diverse experts; practical guidance for designing graph MoEs.

Conclusion: This work constitutes the first systematic empirical study of expert-level diversification for GNN ensembles, offering practical recommendations and deeper understanding for MoE design on graph data; code is publicly available for replication and extension.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shallow networks with power-exponential activations have dimension- and smoothness-dependent approximation rates; ReLU^k cannot attain the best rates under l1-bounded coefficients or insufficient smoothness. Optimal rates are characterized for Barron and Sobolev spaces, but the curse of dimensionality persists, informing activation choices and network design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental limits of shallow neural networks in approximating high-dimensional functions when using activation functions that are powers of exponentials, particularly within Barron spaces, and to identify when optimal rates are achievable.

Method: Theoretical analysis within the Barron function space framework. Derives rate bounds for shallow networks with ReLU^k activations, analyzes the impact of l1-bounded coefficients, and compares results across Barron and Sobolev spaces to establish lower/upper bounds and rate optimality.

Result: Shows that optimal approximation rates cannot be achieved under l1-bounded coefficients or with insufficient smoothness. Establishes optimal rates in Barron and Sobolev spaces and confirms the persistence of the curse of dimensionality.

Conclusion: The findings delineate the inherent limits of shallow networks for this activation family, guiding practitioners in choosing activation functions and network structures, and highlighting when deeper architectures or different smoothness assumptions are necessary to overcome dimensionality barriers.

Abstract: This paper investigates the approximation properties of shallow neural
networks with activation functions that are powers of exponential functions. It
focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the
smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space.
We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.
Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation
capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and
network structures.

### [160] [Learning from N-Tuple Data with M Positive Instances: Unbiased Risk Estimation and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18406)
*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,ChangChun HUa,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NTMP supervision: learning from counts of positive instances in n-tuples; derive a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) from latent marginals; closed-form for fixed (n,m) and extensions; identifiability when mixing rate separated from class prior; generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity; consistency; ReLU corrections for finite-sample stability; empirical wins over baselines and robustness to imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised learning often lacks instance labels; need to exploit coarse aggregate signals like counts within tuples; NTMP setting arises naturally in multi-instance and region-based image classification; objective: recover instance-level risk from counts with theoretical guarantees.

Method: Link tuple-generation to latent marginals; derive closed-form URE for fixed (n,m) and extend to variable tuple sizes and counts; add ReLU-corrected URE for stability; prove identifiability under separation condition; provide generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity; prove statistical consistency; empirical evaluation on NTMP tasks.

Result: Closed-form URE; extensions; identifiability condition; generalization bounds; consistency; ReLU corrections; empirical wins over baselines; robust under class-prior imbalance and varying tuple configurations.

Conclusion: Count-only supervision can be effectively exploited with a theoretically grounded and practically stable objective; NTMP framework with URE yields reliable weak-supervision performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive activation dropout MAGDrop uses gradient and momentum to adjust dropout rates; achieves tighter PAC-Bayes bounds and 1–2% accuracy gains on MNIST/CIFAR-10; suggesting strong generalization benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overfitting in high-capacity DNNs and the need for regulation that respects optimization dynamics; existing dropout and reg methods may fail to leverage momentum-based information.

Method: Activation-based dropout where dropout probability is a function of gradient magnitude and accumulated momentum; derive a tightened PAC-Bayes bound that accounts for adaptive perturbations; empirical validation on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Result: 1–2 percentage-point improvements in test accuracy over baselines on MNIST (99.52%) and CIFAR-10 (90.63%); generalization gaps 0.48% and 7.14%; bound improvements up to ~20% tighter.

Conclusion: MAGDrop provides a principled, theoretically-grounded regularization that improves generalization; potentially beneficial for high-stakes applications; bridges theory and practice.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

*Christopher von Klitzing,Denis Blessing,Henrik Schopmans,Pascal Friederich,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained Mass Transport (CMT) improves sampling from high-dimensional, multimodal unnormalized distributions (Boltzmann generators) by enforcing simultaneous constraints on KL divergence and entropy decay between successive intermediate distributions, enhancing overlap and preventing mode collapse and mass teleportation; it achieves substantially higher effective sample size on BG benchmarks, including the ELIL tetrapeptide.


<details>

Motivation: Efficiently sampling Boltzmann distributions for physical systems (e.g., molecules) is challenging due to multimodality and normalization; standard variational methods suffer from mode collapse, and annealing-based methods can suffer from mass teleportation and require delicate schedule tuning.

Method: Introduce Constrained Mass Transport (CMT), a variational framework that constructs a sequence of intermediate distributions under explicit constraints on the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive steps. This enforces overlap between distributions and stabilizes progression, mitigating premature convergence and sampling bias.

Result: CMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art variational BG methods across standard benchmarks and the newly introduced ELIL tetrapeptide (the largest system studied without MD samples), achieving more than 2.5x higher effective sample size and avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: CMT provides a robust, scalable variational approach for Boltzmann generators that improves sampling efficiency and reliability by controlling distributional transitions, reducing mode collapse, and mitigating mass teleportation, with demonstrated gains on challenging molecular systems.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

*Yili Wang,Tairan Huang,Changlong He,Qiutong Li,Jianliang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, efficient HTGNN (SE-HTGNN) that merges temporal modeling into spatial learning using dynamic attention, and uses LLM prompting to inject node-type priors; achieves strong forecasting accuracy with up to 10x speed-up over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HTGNNs rely on decoupled temporal and spatial modules, which weakens spatio-temporal interactions and increases complexity. There is a need for a more integrated, efficient approach and leveraging prior knowledge from LLMs.

Method: Propose dynamic attention that retains information from historical graph snapshots to guide future attention, integrating temporal modeling into spatial learning; additionally, prompt SE-HTGNN with large language models to capture implicit node-type properties as prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments show SE-HTGNN achieves up to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and maintains best forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN provides a compact, effective framework for heterogeneous temporal graphs by combining integrated spatio-temporal attention with LLM-informed priors, yielding faster training/inference and superior performance.

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

*Yuya Sasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmarking study evaluating fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs by creating large-scale graphs from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata; compares preprocessing and inprocessing methods across multiple GNN backbones and early stopping settings; reveals KG-specific trends and trade-offs between accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in GNNs on knowledge graphs is underexplored despite the importance of knowledge graphs in applications like recommender systems; a scalable benchmark is needed to understand how backbones, stopping rules, and preprocessing affect fairness and accuracy.

Method: Construct large graphs from three major knowledge graphs (YAGO, DBpedia, Wikidata); evaluate both preprocessing and inprocessing fairness methods across different GNN backbones and early stopping conditions; assess trade-offs between accuracy and fairness metrics.

Result: Knowledge graphs show different patterns from existing datasets; there are clearer trade-offs between prediction accuracy and fairness metrics; performance is driven by both the fairness method and the choice of GNN backbone and early stopping; preprocessing methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective fairness-aware GNNs for knowledge graphs require careful consideration of the backbone, stopping strategy, and preprocessing approach; knowledge graphs demand dataset-specific benchmarking and design choices beyond what is used for conventional graph datasets.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

*Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou,Radu Calinescu,Calum Imrie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USC is an uncertainty-aware critic that localizes conservatism to uncertain/costly regions in RL, preserving gradients elsewhere to improve safety without sacrificing reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing safety and performance in RL is difficult: overly conservative approaches hurt task performance while reward-focused methods violate safety and create diffuse cost landscapes that slow learning. A scalable approach that preserves informative gradients while enforcing safety is needed.

Method: Introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC) by integrating uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training. USC concentrates conservatism in uncertain and costly regions and preserves sharp gradients in safe areas, enabling effective reward-safety trade-offs and better alignment of cost gradients with true gradients.

Result: Empirical results show USC reduces safety violations by ~40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by ~83%, breaking the traditional trade-off between safety and performance.

Conclusion: USC advances scalable safe RL by focusing conservatism where uncertainty and costs are high, improving gradient signals and enabling safer, more effective learning.

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

*Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou,Radu Calinescu,Calum Imrie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal-driven perception-to-policy approach with finite-sample safety guarantees (COPPOL) enhances hazard detection and safe navigation, robust to distributional shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable hazard perception with principled uncertainty handling and finite-sample guarantees in safety-critical navigation, where current methods assume perfect detection or lack finite-sample assurances.

Method: COPPOL integrates distribution-free, finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation using conformal methods to produce calibrated hazard maps with bounds on missed detections, which are then used to create risk-aware cost fields for downstream reinforcement learning planning.

Result: On two satellite-derived benchmarks, hazard coverage increases up to 6x compared with baselines, near-complete detection of unsafe regions, hazardous violations during navigation reduced by up to ~50%, and robustness to distributional shift preserving safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: COPPOL provides a principled, uncertainty-aware perception-to-policy framework with finite-sample guarantees that improves safety and efficiency in navigation under distributional shift.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

### [168] [Partial VOROS: A Cost-aware Performance Metric for Binary Classifiers with Precision and Capacity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18520)
*Christopher Ratigan,Kyle Heuton,Carissa Wang,Lenore Cowen,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cost-aware ROC metric: define feasible ROC region under precision and capacity constraints and compute partial VOROS as average of partial areas of feasible classifiers; improves ranking for hospital alert classifiers on MIMIC-IV mortality predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROC AUC ignores deployment constraints (minimum precision, capacity limits) and asymmetric misclassification costs; need metrics aligned with real-world costs and feasibility.

Method: Characterize the feasible region in ROC space under given precision and capacity constraints; define the partial area of lesser classifiers (a monotone metric restricted to feasible ROC space); average this area over a range of cost parameters to obtain the partial volume over the ROC surface (partial VOROS). Empirically evaluate on MIMIC-IV vital-sign based mortality prediction.

Result: Partial VOROS provides better classifier ranking for hospital alert applications than standard alternatives.

Conclusion: A cost-aware ROC framework that enforces deployment constraints yields more relevant evaluation for alert systems; broadly applicable to cost-sensitive deployment of binary classifiers.

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

### [169] [Pay Attention to the Triggers: Constructing Backdoors That Survive Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18541)
*Giovanni De Muri,Mark Vero,Robin Staab,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces T-MTB, a transferable backdoor technique for knowledge distillation from backdoored LLM teachers. Unlike prior backdoors, which rarely transfer because their trigger tokens are infrequent, T-MTB uses a composite trigger formed from tokens that commonly appear in distillation data, allowing the backdoor signal to propagate to the student while remaining stealthy. They study transferability under jailbreaking and content modulation across four model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the security risks of knowledge distillation from untrusted teacher models and to address the observation that prior backdoors seldom transfer to student models due to rare trigger tokens—therefore underestimating distillation risks.

Method: Introduce T-MTB, a composite backdoor trigger built from several specific tokens that individually appear in anticipated distillation datasets. Demonstrate that the backdoor can transfer to student models during distillation while remaining stealthy, and evaluate transferable backdoors across two attack scenarios (jailbreaking and content modulation) and across four LLM model families.

Result: Using T-MTB, the authors demonstrate transferable backdoors in knowledge distillation, showing that backdoors can transfer from poisoned teachers to students. The study covers two attack scenarios and four model families, and finds that the composite trigger enables transferability while keeping the trigger inconspicuous.

Conclusion: Transferable backdoors during knowledge distillation represent a meaningful security risk when using untrusted teacher models. The T-MTB framework exposes this risk and suggests the need for defenses and detection methods to mitigate backdoor transmission in distillation pipelines.

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

*Loc Phuc Truong Nguyen,Hung Thanh Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAISE quantifies responsibility across explainability, fairness, robustness, and sustainability, aggregating into a single score; evaluating MLP, Tabular ResNet, and Feature Tokenizer Transformer on finance/healthcare/socioeconomic datasets reveals trade-offs and no single model dominates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes domains, traditional accuracy is insufficient; there is a need for a unified framework to evaluate models on responsibility dimensions to guide responsible AI deployment.

Method: Define the RAISE framework to measure four dimensions, compute a composite Responsibility Score, and apply it to three models on structured datasets; analyze trade-offs and provide an open-source implementation.

Result: Findings show trade-offs: MLP exhibits strong sustainability and robustness; Transformer excels in explainability and fairness but incurs a high environmental cost; Tabular ResNet offers a balanced profile; no model dominates across all criteria, underscoring the need for multi-dimensional evaluation.

Conclusion: Encourages multi-criteria evaluation for responsible model selection and adoption of RAISE; implementation is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeFS refines feature subsets by adding a Helper Set found from residual features via a genetic algorithm (biased initialization, ratio-guided mutation) and Pareto multi-objective optimization, improving accuracy and feature complementarity across 18 datasets, including biomedical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is NP-hard and prone to premature convergence with greedy heuristics, especially in high-dimensional data with complex interdependencies; there is a need to uncover complementary, informative features that are overlooked by the original subset.

Method: The HeFS framework searches the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set that complements the initial feature subset. It uses a biased initialization scheme and ratio-guided mutation within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature complementarity.

Result: Empirical results on 18 benchmark datasets show HeFS consistently discovers overlooked but informative features and delivers superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, including challenging domains like gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and CS applications.

Conclusion: Helper Set refinement via residual feature search and multi-objective optimization provides a robust improvement over existing feature selection approaches, demonstrating strong cross-domain effectiveness.

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RobLight introduces efficient partial solvers to verify structural robustness of graph neural networks against adversarial graph modifications, achieving faster, scalable robustness verification compared to solver-based methods, and validated on diverse GNN variants and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph attacks on structure and features; existing robustness verification relies on heavy constraint-solving (e.g., MILP), which is computationally expensive and scales poorly; need scalable, practical methods.

Method: Replace full solvers with efficient partial solvers that run in polynomial time but may be incomplete; implement the RobLight tool; evaluate across various GNN architectures and datasets.

Result: Improved structural robustness verification relative to state-of-the-art solver-based approaches; partial solvers provide practical speedups with acceptable incompleteness; validated on diverse GNN variants and datasets.

Conclusion: Partial solving is a viable, scalable approach to adversarial robustness verification for graphs; RobLight offers a practical tool for fast detection of robustness issues in GNNs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

*Fayad Ali Banna,Antoine Caradot,Eduardo Brandao,Jean-Philippe Colombier,Rémi Emonet,Marc Sebban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unrolled-SINDy decouples time-step size from data sampling to stabilize PDE discovery from sparsely observed data, enabling recovery of parameters that standard SINDy misses; compatible with Euler/RK4 and both SINDy and iNeuralSINDy, via closed-form iterations or gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SINDy-based PDE discovery struggles when data are sparsely sampled in time due to large local truncation errors and coupling between sampling rate and numerical step. There's a need for methods that stabilize the optimization and recover true parameters.

Method: Introduce an unrolling scheme that decouples numerical step size from data sampling. Implemented through an iterative closed-form approach or gradient-descent optimization. Tested with traditional SINDy and iNeuralSINDy across Euler and RK4 schemes.

Result: Unrolling improves stability, allowing recovery of equation parameters not minimizers of the original SINDy objective. Demonstrates versatility on both SINDy and iNeuralSINDy with Euler/RK4, solving problems inaccessible to non-unrolled methods.

Conclusion: Unrolling offers a simple, effective augmentation to SINDy-based PDE discovery, expanding applicability to sparsely sampled data and enhancing robustness across numerical schemes and noise-robust variants.

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: Distill boosted trees into a single decision tree using a rectification-based correction approach to balance predictive performance with interpretability, showing competitive results relative to retraining-based distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boosted trees are highly predictive but opaque; the work seeks an interpretable model by distilling the ensemble into a decision tree, using rectification to guide the process.

Method: Apply a rectification-based distillation framework to transfer knowledge from a boosted ensemble to a single decision tree and compare this approach to a baseline retraining-based distillation.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate interesting trade-offs: the rectification-based distillation yields interpretable models with competitive predictive performance, often comparable to or preferable to retraining-based distillation depending on the dataset.

Conclusion: Rectification-based distillation is a viable method for turning boosted trees into interpretable decision trees, offering a practical compromise between accuracy and explainability; further work could refine the correction mechanism and broaden evaluation. 

Abstract: We present a new approach for distilling boosted trees into decision trees,
in the objective of generating an ML model offering an acceptable compromise in
terms of predictive performance and interpretability. We explain how the
correction approach called rectification can be used to implement such a
distillation process. We show empirically that this approach provides
interesting results, in comparison with an approach to distillation achieved by
retraining the model.

*Satwik Bhattamishra,Phil Blunsom,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NSP labels enrich the learning signal but do not cure computational hardness: learning DFAs and Boolean formulas remains hard in the NSP setting, and under cryptographic assumptions the DFA problem is hard even with NSP information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess learnability of languages when learners receive only positive examples plus NSP-type labels (membership for prefixes and available next symbols). This clarifies implications for PAC-learning and the empirical study of neural sequence models, and it connects NSP to learning the (truncated) support of language models.

Method: Formalize NSP within PAC-learning, then construct a reduction showing that adding NSP labels does not circumvent hardness: almost all additional NSP labels are uninformative, reducing NSP-learning to conventional learning. Under cryptographic assumptions, this yields computational hardness for DFA and Boolean formula learning in the NSP setting.

Result: Despite richer NSP labels, learning of standard concept classes such as DFAs and Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The hardness is demonstrated via a construction where extra NSP information is largely uninformative, transforming the NSP problem into the traditional learning problem; under crypto assumptions, DFA learning is hard in NSP.

Conclusion: NSP enriches the labeling space but does not remove fundamental computational barriers for these classes. This motivates careful interpretation of NSP-based analyses (e.g., empirical studies on neural models) and suggests limits to what NSP-based learning can achieve for formal language classes; nonetheless NSP may still be useful for studying truncated LM supports.

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes in-context learning of transformers on dynamics-driven functions, providing a closed-form global minimizer for a single-layer linear self-attention model, proving NP-hardness of recovering optimal parameters, and interpreting multilayer LSA as preconditioned gradient descent, with numerical validation of the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers realize in-context learning (ICL) beyond linear regression with i.i.d. inputs, focusing on dynamics-driven, Markovian function learning, and to investigate the loss landscape and optimization behavior of one-layer and multilayer LSA.

Method: Derive a closed-form expression for the global minimizer in an enlarged parameter space for a single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; prove that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard; provide a novel interpretation of multilayer LSA as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives beyond the square loss; validate results through numerical experiments on simplified transformers.

Result: Closed-form global minimizer for single-layer LSA; NP-hardness proof for recovering optimal parameters; reinterpretation of multilayer LSA as preconditioned gradient descent; numerical validation supporting the theoretical claims.

Conclusion: The work sheds light on the optimization landscape of ICL for structured dynamical tasks, highlighting limitations of one-layer LSA in such settings and offering a gradient-descent interpretation for multilayer LSA, with empirical validation. This establishes fundamental insights into using transformer-based ICL for dynamics-driven functions and informs future architecture and training considerations.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

### [177] [Informed Learning for Estimating Drought Stress at Fine-Scale Resolution Enables Accurate Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18648)
*Miro Miranda,Marcela Charfuelan,Matias Valdenegro Toro,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed deep ensemble model links water scarcity to crop yield, predicting drought stress and yield sensitivity to water with high accuracy (R^2 up to 0.82) and improved explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water shortages threaten agricultural productivity; crop models are interpretable but limited in capturing data-driven complexity; ML models excel at prediction but often ignore physical crop-growth principles. A hybrid approach aims to combine accuracy with physical consistency and explainability.

Method: Formulate yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both crop drought stress and the farmer-relevant sensitivity to water scarcity in a sequential fashion. Introduce a physics-informed loss to enforce physical consistency with water-driven crop growth. Use multispectral satellite imagery, meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data as inputs. Employ deep ensembles to quantify predictive uncertainty.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models such as LSTMs and Transformers in crop yield prediction, achieving an R^2 up to 0.82, while offering enhanced explainability and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: A hybrid physics-informed, data-driven framework bridges crop simulation and machine learning, delivering accurate, physically consistent yield predictions under changing climate and providing actionable insights for industry, policymakers, and farmers.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

### [178] [Learning Time-Varying Turn-Taking Behavior in Group Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18649)
*Madeline Navarro,Lisa O'Bryan,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flexible probabilistic model predicting turn-taking in group conversations using individual traits and past behavior, generalizable across groups, and capable of capturing how last-speaking time influences inclination; validated on synthetic and real data; argues traditional universal models can be unrealistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models of conversation dynamics often fail to generalize beyond a single group and rely on universal formulations that may not fit all groups. There is a need for a data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach that can generalize across groups and account for how speaking propensity depends on when an individual last spoke.

Method: Develop a generalized probabilistic model that uses individuals' characteristics (e.g., personality traits) and their past speaking behavior to predict speaking turns. The model learns how speaking inclination varies as a function of time since last speaking, and is validated on both synthetic and real-world conversation datasets to assess generalization across groups.

Result: The approach is applied to both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating that it can generalize beyond a specific group and capture realistic turn-taking dynamics. It also shows that some prior behavioral models may be unrealistic, supporting a data-driven yet theoretically grounded framework.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a generalizable, data-driven method for modeling turn-taking in group conversations, addressing generalization limits of prior models and providing a realistic account of how last-spoken timing influences speaking propensity across individuals.

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

*Mustafa Fuad Rifet Ibrahim,Tunc Alkanat,Maurice Meijer,Felix Manthey,Alexander Schlaefer,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: On-device deep learning for synchronized ECG and PCG classification enables energy-efficient, accurate cardiovascular screening on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiovascular risk via wearable sensors; need robust, efficient analysis on resource-constrained devices; reduce clinician workload.

Method: CNN with early fusion applied to synchronized ECG and PCG; binary classification; trained/validated on Physionet Challenge 2016; evaluated on microcontroller and sensor device setup.

Result: Significant memory and compute savings (~1000×) vs state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive accuracy; on-device inference more energy-efficient than continuous streaming.

Conclusion: Feasible deployment of on-device DL for ECG+PCG data on medical edge devices; enables autonomous screening with low energy cost and reliable performance.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

### [180] [Reasoning Language Model Inference Serving Unveiled: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18672)
*Qi Li,Junpan Wu,Xiang Liu,Yuxin Wang,Zeyu Li,Zhenheng Tang,Yuhan Chen,Shaohuai Shi,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how Reasoning LLMs (RLLMs) perform in serving contexts, revealing unique runtime behavior and evaluating inference optimizations; quantization and speculative decoding can improve efficiency with small accuracy trade-offs, while some caching techniques may hurt small RLLMs; real-world Gamma-based workloads validate the findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the deployment performance and behavior of RLLMs in production, addressing gaps not covered by studies on general LLM serving.

Method: 1) Pilot study comparing serving performance of RLLM vs traditional LLM; 2) analyze effectiveness of inference optimizations (quantization, speculative decoding, prefix caching, KV cache quantization); 3) evaluate under real-world workload modeled by Gamma distribution across datasets; 4) empirical validation of findings.

Result: RLLMs exhibit distinct serving behaviors: heavy memory usage and fluctuations, presence of straggler requests, adaptive running time, and domain preference. Quantization methods and speculative decoding can boost service efficiency with modest accuracy loss; prefix caching and KV cache quantization may degrade accuracy or performance for small RLLMs. Real-world workload experiments align with these conclusions.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for RLLM inference serving, indicating that standard optimization techniques may need adaptation for RLLMs and offering guidance for researchers and industry on deploying efficient RLLM serving in real-world settings.

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

### [181] [Learning Task-Agnostic Representations through Multi-Teacher Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18680)
*Philippe Formont,Maxime Darrin,Banafsheh Karimian,Jackie CK Cheung,Eric Granger,Ismail Ben Ayed,Mohammadhadi Shateri,Pablo Piantanida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A task-agnostic multi-teacher distillation framework using a majority vote objective, bounded by mutual information between student and teacher embeddings, enabling cross-domain, label-free representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit diversity from multiple teachers to produce generalized embeddings without task-specific supervision, across text, vision, and molecular data.

Method: Introduce a majority vote distillation loss; derive a bound via mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings; produce a task-agnostic objective independent of labels or prior knowledge.

Result: Empirically improves downstream performance across classification, clustering, and regression in text, vision, and molecular modeling; releases state-of-the-art embedding models.

Conclusion: A robust, task-agnostic distillation paradigm that leverages teacher diversity to yield high-quality representations without task-specific labels, with broad applicability and practical model releases.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

### [182] [Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Transition Predictions: A Bellman-Jensen Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18687)
*Chenbei Lu,Zaiwei Chen,Tongxin Li,Chenye Wu,Adam Wierman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work tackles multi-step prediction in RL by introducing a Bayesian value function, a Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis, and the BOLA algorithm, proving sample efficiency even with imperfect predictions, validated on synthetic MDPs and wind-energy storage tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world RL problems agents have access to multi-step future state predictions, but naively embedding them into an MDP causes exponential state-space growth and the standard one-step transition theory cannot handle prediction errors or partial action coverage. There is a need for tractable analysis and efficient algorithms that leverage imperfect multi-step predictions.

Method: 1) Define a Bayesian value function to capture the optimal policy when using prediction information. 2) Develop Bellman-Jensen Gap analysis to bound the value under imperfect/miscalibrated predictions. 3) Propose BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that learns offline Bayesian values and performs lightweight online adaptation to real-time predictions.

Result: The paper proves that BOLA remains sample-efficient despite imperfect predictions. Empirical validation on synthetic MDPs and a real-world wind energy storage control problem demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The Bayesian value framework and Bellman-Jensen Gap provide tractable tools to analyze and bound the impact of imperfect multi-step predictions in RL, and BOLA offers a practical, sample-efficient method that leverages offline Bayesian learning with online adaptation for real-time predictions.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

### [183] [OmniCast: A Masked Latent Diffusion Model for Weather Forecasting Across Time Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18707)
*Tung Nguyen,Tuan Pham,Troy Arcomano,Veerabhadra Kotamarthi,Ian Foster,Sandeep Madireddy,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniCast is a two-stage probabilistic model for weather forecasting that unifies multiple timescales by encoding data into a latent space with a VAE and using a diffusion-based transformer to generate future latent tokens, trained with masked token prediction and inferred via iterative unmasking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive weather models accumulate errors over long horizons and struggle to unify forecasting across time scales; a scalable, non-autoregressive approach that can model long sequences and provide probabilistic forecasts is needed.

Method: Encode raw weather data into a low-dimensional latent space with a VAE. Use a diffusion-based transformer to generate a sequence of future latent tokens conditioned on current tokens. Train by masking random future tokens and teaching the transformer to predict their distributions with a per-token diffusion head. During inference, iteratively unmask random subsets of tokens to sample the full future sequence, enabling joint space-time sampling.

Result: OmniCast matches leading probabilistic methods at medium-range and is 10x–20x faster; it achieves state-of-the-art performance at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales across accuracy, physics-based and probabilistic metrics, and can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years.

Conclusion: A scalable, skillful probabilistic forecasting framework that unifies weather forecasting across timescales via latent-space diffusion, mitigating error accumulation and enabling long-horizon, stable predictions while offering substantial computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

### [184] [Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713)
*Joongkyu Lee,Seouh-won Yi,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes M-AUPO, an online PbRL algorithm using Plackett-Luce ranking feedback over action subsets to improve sample efficiency; shows larger subsets improve performance with favorable bounds; provides near-matching lower bound demonstrating subset-size benefits; first theory showing subset-size driven efficiency gains in PbRL with ranking feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on ranking-based PbRL either uses pairwise feedback or, when using multiple comparisons, yields guarantees that do not improve with longer feedback and can worsen. There is a need for a theory showing how ranking feedback from larger action subsets can meaningfully improve sample efficiency.

Method: Introduce M-AUPO, which selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset under the Plackett-Luce model for ranking feedback. Theoretical analysis yields suboptimality gap bounds that scale with the subset size, and a near-matching lower bound.

Result: Suboptimality gap: ~ (d/T) * sqrt( sum_{t=1}^T 1/|S_t| ), demonstrating that larger subsets reduce regret. Lower bound: Omega( d / (K * sqrt(T)) ) where K is the maximum subset size. Bound avoids exponential dependence on unknown parameter norms.

Conclusion: First theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback showing improved sample efficiency as a function of subset size; confirms that using larger ranking feedback subsets can lead to better performance guarantees.

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STEAM is a synthetic data generator for treatment-effect analysis in medicine that optimizes for downstream utility by preserving covariates, treatment assignment, and outcomes, achieving state-of-the-art performance versus existing generative models, especially for complex data-generating processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data access is often restricted; synthetic data can enable causal inference research and development of new methods. Existing generative models neglect treatment-focused downstream tasks, potentially limiting utility for treatment-effect analyses.

Method: Introduce a set of desiderata for synthetic data containing treatments (preserve covariate distribution, treatment assignment mechanism, and outcome generation). Propose evaluation metrics aligned with these desiderata. Present STEAM, a generative approach that mimics the data-generating process for treated data and optimizes for these desiderata.

Result: STEAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across the proposed metrics compared with existing generative models, with pronounced gains as the true data-generating process becomes more complex.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generated by STEAM can meaningfully support treatment-effect analyses in medicine under regulatory constraints, by aligning data generation with the causal needs of downstream inference and outperforming baselines, particularly in challenging, complex DGP scenarios.

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

TL;DR: L2O-CFGD learns to dynamically tune Caputo fractional gradient descent hyperparameters via meta-learning, improving optimization over static CFGD and rivaling some black-box optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FGD methods struggle with convergence and hyperparameter tuning; understanding hyperparameter effects and scheduling in non-convex neural network optimization.

Method: Introduce Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD) that meta-learns a schedule of CFGD hyperparameters; employs meta-learning to adapt hyperparameters based on optimization history.

Result: The meta-learned schedule outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found by comprehensive search, and in some tasks approaches performance of fully black-box meta-learned optimizers.

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD is a useful tool to discover effective hyperparameters and to gain insights into the history-dependence of fractional derivatives in optimization.

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

*Soroush Tabesh,Mher Safaryan,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAGE augments the straight-through estimator with curvature-aware gradient corrections in QAT, forming a Pareto-conscious optimization approach that improves convergence and reduces quantization-induced loss, showing notable gains on large Llama-style models in W4A4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Close the accuracy gap between low-bit quantization-aware training and native/full-precision training by incorporating curvature information into gradient updates.

Method: Introduce a curvature-aware correction term to the STE gradient, derived from a multi-objective view that balances loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints; optimizer-agnostic, with an efficient implementation leveraging Adam statistics; yields Pareto-optimal solutions and convergence guarantees in smooth non-convex settings.

Result: The approach provides theoretical convergence guarantees for quantized optimization, and empirically recovers over 10% of the quantization-induced loss increase in pre-trained Llama-style models (up to 800M parameters) in the W4A4 regime compared to outlier-mitigation baselines.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware gradient corrections can bridge much of the remaining performance gap in QAT beyond current outlier-handling strategies, and the method is compatible with standard optimizers and scalable implementations.

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

### [188] [Stick-Breaking Embedded Topic Model with Continuous Optimal Transport for Online Analysis of Document Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18786)
*Federica Granese,Serena Villata,Charles Bouveyron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SB-SETM extends ETM for streaming topics by (i) using truncated stick-breaking to infer the active topic count per timestep, and (ii) a continuous optimal-transport-based merge of topic embeddings across time. Evaluated on simulated data and a real-world Russian–Ukrainian war news corpus (2022–2023), where it outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online topic models for data streams face challenges absent in offline settings: unknown and time-varying number of topics, and the need to align or merge topics across successive time windows as topics evolve.

Method: Introduce SB-SETM, an online extension of the Embedded Topic Model (ETM). It employs a truncated stick-breaking process to auto-infer the number of active topics at each timestep, and a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous formulation of optimal transport, suited for high-dimensional latent spaces. The model processes data in successive partial document batches and merges topics across timesteps to maintain coherent topic trajectories.

Result: Experiments on simulated data show SB-SETM outperforms baselines. Real-world evaluation on a large news corpus about the Russia–Ukraine war (2022–2023) demonstrates robustness and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SB-SETM provides a principled online topic modeling framework with automatic topic-number inference and principled topic-embedding merging, enabling effective tracking of evolving topics in streaming text data.

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

### [189] [On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808)
*Marc Gong Bacvanski,Liu Ziyin,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A continuous-time neural model unifies SGD, FA, DFA, and KP as limiting cases; learning thrives at biological timescales with stability under noise and temporal mismatches; learning depends on temporal overlap and requires seconds-scale eligibility traces for robust error-driven learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological learning is continuous and time-dependent, but many models use discrete updates and phase separation. A unified, continuous-time framework could explain robustness to timing and integrate multiple biologically plausible learning rules.

Method: Propose a continuous-time dynamical system for synaptic updates that yields SGD, FA, DFA, and KP as limiting cases. Analyze how learning depends on temporal overlap between inputs and error signals, derive linear decay of learning as delay approaches stimulus duration, and determine the plasticity timescale required for robust learning. Validate via simulations, including temporal mismatch and integration noise scenarios.

Result: The model learns stably at biological timescales. The listed learning rules emerge naturally as limits of the dynamics. Learning strength decays linearly with increasing delay between input and error under constant inputs. Robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to exceed the stimulus duration by 1–2 orders of magnitude, implying seconds-scale eligibility traces for cortical-like stimuli, and predicting observable traces essential for error-driven learning in biological circuits.

Conclusion: A unifying, biologically plausible continuous-time framework explains how several learning algorithms can operate without phase separation, identifies key temporal requirements (eligibility windows) for effective error-driven learning, and yields testable predictions about plasticity timescales in cortex.

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

### [190] [When LRP Diverges from Leave-One-Out in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18810)
*Weiqiu You,Siqi Zeng,Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai,Makoto Yamada,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRP’s bilinear propagation rules in AttnLRP violate implementation invariance, and softmax-based relevance propagation introduces errors that hinder LRP from matching Leave-One-Out (LOO) in Transformers. CP-LRP can serve as a diagnostic baseline, and bypassing softmax (propagating relevance only through value matrices) improves LOO alignment, especially in middle-to-late layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LRP is axiomatically sound for modern Transformers and whether it can realistically approximate LOO feature importance, focusing on implementation invariance and propagation through attention components.

Method: (1) Theoretical analytic proof that bilinear propagation in AttnLRP breaks the implementation invariance axiom; (2) empirical verification of this violation in linear attention layers; (3) revisit CP-LRP as a diagnostic baseline; (4) experiments where relevance is propagated only through value matrices (bypassing softmax) to evaluate alignment with LOO across Transformer depths.

Result: Analytical and empirical evidence show bilinear factorization sensitivity and softmax propagation errors undermine LRP’s ability to approximate LOO in Transformers; removing softmax propagation (value-only backprop) improves alignment with LOO, notably in middle-to-late layers.

Conclusion: Current bilinear LRP rules may not be axiomatic for Transformers, and softmax-driven propagation errors limit LRP’s fidelity to LOO. Alternative strategies like value-only propagation and CP-LRP baselines offer improved alignment and highlight the need for redesigned propagation rules in Transformer LRP.

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

*Jesús García Fernández,Nasir Ahmad,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey unifying iterative optimization across derivative orders, showing zeroth-order (ZO) methods as scalable, biologically plausible alternatives to backpropagation, with implications for neuromorphic hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge classic optimization theory with neural network training and biology; address scalability and energy efficiency of gradient-based methods; explore how ZO methods use randomness and exploration as a principled mechanism for learning, potentially aligning with brain processes and hardware noise.

Method: Categorize optimization by the order of derivative information (first-, second-, higher-order; zeroth-order); review adaptations to neural network training and learning dynamics; extend the optimization lens to biological learning, highlighting the role of intrinsic noise.

Result: ZO methods can effectively approximate gradients and achieve competitive performance with backpropagation in neural networks; random exploration and feedback-guided adaptation can underpin learning; brain-inspired perspectives suggest intrinsic noise can be a useful computational resource; potential benefits for neuromorphic hardware.

Conclusion: A zeroth-order optimization paradigm offers a principled framework connecting natural and artificial learning, enabling faster, energy-efficient AI by leveraging noise and simple function-evaluation-based updates, and guiding future ML and hardware design.

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

### [192] [Online SFT for LLM Reasoning: Surprising Effectiveness of Self-Tuning without Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18814)
*Mengqi Li,Lei Zhao,Anthony Man-Cho So,Ruoyu Sun,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSFT is a simple, reward-free online finetuning approach where an LLM is finetuned on its own self-generated outputs, using one rollout by default. It yields competitive math-reasoning performance vs RL-based methods (e.g., GRPO) with high efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on reward-based RL for improving LLM reasoning by leveraging the model's own latent knowledge and pretraining, enabling an efficient, scalable training paradigm.

Method: Generate self-responses with the model, then finetune the model on this self-generated data in an online supervised fashion (OSFT). The setup uses no external rewards and typically only a single rollout per iteration.

Result: On challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, OSFT achieves downstream performance comparable to strong RLVR methods like GRPO. Ablation studies demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the approach.

Conclusion: OSFT offers a practical, efficient alternative to reward-based training for improving LLM reasoning by aligning the model with its own latent preferences; the approach is promising and gains are demonstrated with empirical results. Code is provided at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

### [193] [Search Self-play: Pushing the Frontier of Agent Capability without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18821)
*Hongliang Lu,Yuhang Wen,Pengyu Cheng,Ruijin Ding,Haotian Xu,Jiaqi Guo,Chutian Wang,Haonan Chen,Xiaoxi Jiang,Guanjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-play SSP trains deep search agents by letting a single LLM both propose complex search tasks and solve them, using its own search results as external knowledge and RAG to verify ground-truth. This autonomous loop yields performance gains across benchmarks without external supervision, in both from-scratch and continual RL settings; code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR relies on carefully crafted task prompts and ground-truth rewards, which are costly and limit scalable RL, especially for agentic tasks. There is a need for scalable, automatic task generation and verification to enable true RL scaling.

Method: Propose-and-solve self-play (SSP) where the learning LLM alternates roles as task proposer and problem solver in a multi-turn search setting. The proposer generates deep search queries with ground-truth answers; the solver attempts to answer. All search results from the proposer’s trajectory are treated as external knowledge, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tests verify whether the query can be answered with the provided documents. Proposer and solver co-evolve through competition and cooperation, with increasing task difficulty and no external supervision.

Result: SSP significantly improves search agents’ performance across benchmarks. The gains hold under both from-scratch and continuous RL training without any supervision.

Conclusion: SSP offers a scalable, autonomous approach to agentic RLVR by leveraging self-play between task generation and problem solving, reducing human labeling effort and enabling robust performance improvements. The authors provide code for reproduction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

*Seunghee Ryu,Donghoon Kwon,Seongjin Choi,Aryan Deshwal,Seungmo Kang,Carolina Osorio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BO4Mob is a benchmark for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization applied to origin-destination travel demand estimation in large urban road networks; it features five San Jose-based scenarios with input dimensions up to 10,100, where each objective evaluation is expensive, stochastic, and non-differentiable. The framework compares five optimization methods and provides code for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating origin-destination travel demand from limited traffic sensor data is a challenging inverse optimization problem in large-scale networks. It involves high-dimensional, expensive-to-evaluate, non-differentiable objectives. A scalable, realistic benchmark is needed to develop and evaluate Bayesian optimization algorithms and to enable data-driven urban mobility models such as digital twins.

Method: BO4Mob constructs five realistic scenarios based on real-world San Jose road networks, with input dimensionalities up to 10,100. High-resolution, open-source traffic simulations with nonlinear, stochastic dynamics are used. The benchmark evaluates five optimization methods (three state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines). Code and documentation are released at the provided GitHub repository.

Result: The benchmark demonstrates utility by evaluating five optimization methods, illustrating the framework’s capacity to test scalable optimization algorithms and to support data-driven urban mobility model design.

Conclusion: BO4Mob provides a platform to develop scalable BO methods and apply them to urban mobility modeling, including digital twins of metropolitan road networks; the codebase is openly available for researchers.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,
including high-resolution digital twins of metropolitan road networks. Code and
documentation are available at https://github.com/UMN-Choi-Lab/BO4Mob.

### [195] [Actor-Free Continuous Control via Structurally Maximizable Q-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18828)
*Yigit Korkmaz,Urvi Bhuwania,Ayush Jain,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a purely value-based Q-learning method for continuous control that uses structural maximization of Q-functions, enabling stable, actor-free learning that matches or exceeds actor-critic baselines, especially in constrained action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value-based methods are simple and stable but struggle with continuous actions due to the need to optimize over actions. Actor-critic methods mitigate this but can be unstable. There is a need for a purely value-based, stable, sample-efficient approach for continuous control that avoids learning a separate actor, particularly where action spaces are constrained and Q-functions are non-smooth.

Method: Introduces a value-based framework that emphasizes structural maximization of Q-functions. Adopts architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning without an actor (actor-free Q-learning). Evaluated on standard simulation tasks and compared to state-of-the-art baselines; code release provided.

Result: On standard simulation tasks, the method achieves performance and sample efficiency on par with state-of-the-art baselines without learning an actor. In constrained action spaces where Q-functions are non-smooth, structural maximization outperforms traditional actor-critic methods that maximize gradients.

Conclusion: Actor-free Q-learning is a viable and competitive alternative for continuous control, offering stability and efficiency while avoiding the costs of training a separate actor. Code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

*Jingya Cheng,Alaleh Azhir,Jiazi Tian,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents a counterfactual inference framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 among heart failure patients, combining predictive modeling with counterfactual search (NICE and MOC) to identify actionable pathways; achieves AUROC 0.88 in a 2700-patient cohort with interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge causal reasoning and predictive modeling to support personalized interventions in complex biomedical systems, demonstrated on PASC-related HF risk.

Method: Integrates regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search, using exact enumeration plus optimization-based methods (Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations - NICE; Multi-Objective Counterfactuals - MOC) to explore high-dimensional intervention spaces. Leveraged longitudinal data (diagnoses, labs, medications) from a large health-system cohort to identify pathways that could modify PASC-related HF hospitalizations.

Result: Strong discriminative performance (AUROC 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84–0.91). Generated interpretable, patient-specific counterfactuals showing how altering comorbidity patterns or treatments could change outcomes.

Conclusion: Formalizing counterfactual reasoning as optimization over predictive functions yields a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for personalized inference in complex biomedical systems.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

*Howard Chen,Noam Razin,Karthik Narasimhan,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based post-training on LMs exhibits less forgetting than supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while achieving similar or better target-task performance, due to RL's mode-seeking on-policy data which helps preserve prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate catastrophic forgetting during post-training of language models by comparing SFT and RL, and to uncover the mechanism behind any forgetting differences.

Method: Systematic experiments across LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge, arithmetic reasoning); model LM as a mixture of prior knowledge and task knowledge; analyze mode-seeking effects of on-policy data; compare on-policy data with KL regularization and advantage estimation; validate practicality of using approximately on-policy data.

Result: RL reduces forgetting compared with SFT while achieving comparable or higher target-task performance across LM families and tasks; the mode-seeking effect of RL with on-policy data helps retain prior knowledge; on-policy data robustness is a key factor over algorithmic choices like KL regularization or advantage estimation.

Conclusion: Approximately on-policy data can mitigate forgetting efficiently in post-training; adopting RL-like on-policy data strategies may yield practical guidelines to preserve preexisting capabilities while adapting LMs to new tasks.

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

*Christopher A McClurg,Alan R Wagner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: In a VR study with 150 participants role-playing a school shooter, an autonomous robot using an aggressive approach and high-distraction cues reduced casualties by 46.6% compared to no robot, suggesting safety potential but raising ethical concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether autonomous robotic interventions can distract or impede a shooter in high-risk scenarios, and examine safety benefits alongside associated ethical and societal implications.

Method: A virtual reality study with 150 university participants acting as the shooter. An autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself to interfere. The robot's approach was manipulated (aggressive vs. passive) and distraction level varied (low: none; medium: siren/lights; high: siren/lights + smoke). Outcomes measured included the number of victims relative to a no-robot control.

Result: An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced victims by 46.6% relative to the no-robot control, indicating a potential safety advantage of robotic intervention in such scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate potential safety benefits of robotic interference in active-threat situations but also highlight significant ethical considerations—privacy, autonomy, potential unintended consequences, and the risks of deploying robots in school environments—warranting further study.

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios
by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To
evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university
participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an
autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself
strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to
approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the
shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction
method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to
siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,
high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a
no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic
intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding
their use in school environments.

Abstract: Testing on real machines is indispensable for robotic control algorithms. In
the context of learning-based algorithms, especially VLA models, demand for
large-scale evaluation, i.e. testing a large number of models on a large number

non-trivial, especially when scalability and reproducibility is taken into

TL;DR: End-to-end reinforcement learning for autonomous humanoid goalkeeping that integrates human motion priors via adversarial training to achieve natural, agile, real-time interceptions and generalization to related tasks on real-world robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two core challenges in humanoid goalkeeping: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions and (2) covering a wider guarding range with equivalent response time, enabling fully autonomous behavior without teleoperation.

Method: Train a single end-to-end RL policy conditioned on perceptual inputs; integrate multiple human motion priors into the RL objective via an adversarial scheme to encourage naturalistic motions; validate on real humanoid robots performing agile interceptions and generalizing to tasks like ball escaping and grabbing.

Result: Real-world experiments show the humanoid robot achieves autonomous, dynamic, and naturalistic ball interceptions; the approach also generalizes to related tasks such as ball escaping and grabbing, demonstrating practicality and scalability of the solution.

Conclusion: The work advances autonomous, lifelike interaction between humanoid robots and moving objects, highlighting a scalable path toward adaptive, human-like behaviors in real-world robotic manipulation and defense tasks.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with
humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated
similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces
two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions,
and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion
tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL
policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object
interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors
conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial
scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world
experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous,
and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to
goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks
such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable
solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving
objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic
behaviors.

TL;DR: A coordinated GVF-based framework (CGVF) for multi-robot navigation on m-D manifolds in R^n using non-Euclidean metrics. It decouples the last m propagation terms via carefully chosen auxiliary vectors, treats the manifold parameters as virtual coordinates, and enables on-manifold, ordering-flexible coordination by sharing these virtual coordinates with neighbors and a virtual target. Validated with simulations across varying configurations, demonstrating robustness to initialization, higher dimensions, and robot failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When robots maneuver on constrained m-D manifolds in high-dimensional spaces, achieving ordering-flexible coordination with non-Euclidean metrics is challenging due to strong couplings between the propagation terms (derived from the manifold’s implicit zero-level sets). This coupling can hinder on-manifold maneuvering, singularity handling, and global convergence.

Method: 1) Identify feasible auxiliary vectors that decouple the last m entries of the GVF propagation term, making them a constant. 2) Redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF) by treating the m manifold parameters as additional m virtual coordinates to improve singularity elimination and global convergence. 3) Enable on-manifold ordering-flexible motion by allowing each robot to share its m virtual coordinates with time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, avoiding complex Euclidean-metric calculations. 4) Validate via extensive simulations with varying initial conditions, higher-dimensional manifolds, and scenarios with robot breakdown.

Result: The CGVF framework achieves decoupled propagation terms, enhanced singularity elimination, and global convergence on m-D manifolds. The sharing of virtual coordinates enables on-manifold, ordering-flexible coordination under non-Euclidean metrics, demonstrated through extensive simulations.

Conclusion: Incorporating m virtual coordinates and decoupled propagation terms yields robust, flexible on-manifold coordination for multi-robot systems under non-Euclidean metrics. The approach supports higher-dimensional manifolds and resilience to robot failures, highlighting the benefits of CVGF-like designs for manifold-constrained navigation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots
maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial
ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved
via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be
characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$
entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the
partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not
appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold
maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further
design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.
  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary
vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively
decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)
algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global
convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual
coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion
coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its
time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the
possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally,
we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness
through extensive simulations with different initial positions,
higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

### [202] [R2BC: Multi-Agent Imitation Learning from Single-Agent Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18085)
*Connor Mattson,Varun Raveendra,Ellen Novoseller,Nicholas Waytowich,Vernon J. Lawhern,Daniel S. Brown*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A single human operator can train multi-robot systems by sequentially teaching agents one-at-a-time via Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC); it matches or surpasses oracle behavior cloning trained on joint demonstrations, validated in four simulated tasks and two real-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning excels for single robots, but extending it to multi-agent teams with a single demonstrator is challenging due to the need for joint-action demonstrations. R2BC reduces this burden by allowing sequential, single-agent demonstrations to teach the entire team.

Method: Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC): a human teleoperates one agent at a time, collecting single-agent demonstrations and incrementally training each agent's policy. This avoids requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. Evaluated across four simulated multi-agent tasks, compared to an oracle BC trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations, and deployed on two physical robot tasks with real human input.

Result: R2BC achieves performance comparable to, and sometimes better than, oracle BC across four simulated tasks and is successfully deployed on two real-robot tasks using real demonstrations.

Conclusion: R2BC provides a scalable, practical framework for multi-agent imitation learning from a single demonstrator, reducing demonstration burden while delivering competitive performance in both simulation and real-world robotics.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots,
particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has
been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have
addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in
settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of
collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin
Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to
effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent
demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a
time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without
requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that
R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle
behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations
across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two
physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

*Dharmik Patel,Antonio Rafael Vazquez Pantoja,Jiuzhou Lei,Kiju Lee,Xiao Liang,Minghui Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper using TPU pockets and steel wires enables versatile, gentle fruit harvesting with low mechanical complexity and low damage, demonstrated on tomatoes with zero immediate damage and <9% bruising after five days.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address labor-intensive fruit harvesting and limitations of conventional rigid/vacuum grippers and enveloping grippers by achieving gentle, adaptable grasp across varying fruit sizes with reduced design complexity and energy use.

Method: 3D-printed TPU pockets integrated with steel wires form a constricting mechanism when actuated by servo-driven cables; autonomous grip adjustment is achieved via motor feedback allowing tunable grip strength; lightweight design with few components to reduce cost and complexity.

Result: Tomatoes within the effective size range were harvested with 0% immediate damage and bruising under 9% after five days, supporting the gripper’s gentle handling and adaptability.

Conclusion: The drawstring-inspired soft gripper offers a versatile, gentle, low-cost solution for fruit harvesting across varying sizes, with demonstrated success on tomatoes; potential broader applicability and room for testing on additional fruit types and long-term durability.

Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating
the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or
vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy
consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack
adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a
drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit
harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when
actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow
versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which
requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to
other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while
motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.
Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective
size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a
bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's
suitability for fruit harvesting.

### [204] [Quality Over Quantity: Curating Contact-Based Robot Datasets Improves Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18137)
*Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Victor Vantilborgh,Ian Abraham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper analyzes data utility for robot learning, arguing that data quality (informative, contact-based data) can outperform sheer quantity. It introduces a contact-aware objective and Fisher-information metric to rank and curate data, showing that a smaller, informative dataset can accelerate learning and yield more deterministic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether more data or the right data is more beneficial for robot learning, with a focus on contact-based information which is highly informative for object dynamics and shape.

Method: Derives a contact-aware objective for learning from pose and contact; defines a contact-aware Fisher-information metric to rank data; uses this metric to curate a reduced dataset; evaluates learning performance with curated vs. larger datasets across contact interactions.

Result: The Fisher-information-based ranking can identify informative data; curated smaller datasets improve learning efficiency and determinism; increased data volume does not necessarily improve performance and can be detrimental depending on contact interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed metric can guide data curation for contact-based robot learning, offering initial guidance on choosing informative data and highlighting data efficiency as a route to better learning outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data
or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are
interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds
significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a
contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from
pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric
can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is
for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on
this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a
deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not
necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate
learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how
our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for
contact-based robot learning.

### [205] [MoMaGen: Generating Demonstrations under Soft and Hard Constraints for Multi-Step Bimanual Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18316)
*Chengshu Li,Mengdi Xu,Arpit Bahety,Hang Yin,Yunfan Jiang,Huang Huang,Josiah Wong,Sujay Garlanka,Cem Gokmen,Ruohan Zhang,Weiyu Liu,Jiajun Wu,Roberto Martín-Martín,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoMaGen is a constrained-optimization data generation framework for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation that yields diverse, reachability-feasible and visibility-conscious demonstrations, enabling imitation learning from a single source demonstration and requiring minimal real-world data for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing large-scale, diverse demonstrations for mobile, bimanual robots is expensive and challenging, especially due to base placement and camera visibility constraints. Existing methods fall short for mobile settings, motivating a principled data-generation approach.

Method: Formulate data generation as constrained optimization with hard constraints (e.g., reachability) and soft constraints (e.g., visibility) to choose base placements and camera poses. Generalizes prior methods and enables generating diverse datasets. Evaluated on four tasks; trained imitation policies from a single demonstration and fine-tuned with ~40 real-world demos.

Result: Compared to existing approaches, MoMaGen produces significantly more diverse datasets and enables successful imitation policies trained from a single source demonstration, with fine-tuning on real data as few as 40 demonstrations to deploy on hardware.

Conclusion: A constrained-optimization data-generation framework provides a principled, scalable foundation for data-efficient imitation learning in multi-step, mobile, bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven
effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and
time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile
manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two
high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have
addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations
in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key
challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)
positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor
policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data
generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints
(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during
navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a
principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four
multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates
significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this
diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a
single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few
as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic
hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

### [206] [MoTVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Unified Fast-Slow Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18337)
*Wenhui Huang,Changhe Chen,Han Qi,Chen Lv,Yilun Du,Heng Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoTVLA introduces a mixture-of-transformers vision-language-action model that unifies fast-slow reasoning with behavior policy learning to improve language steerability and efficiency in visuomotor tasks by decomposing motion instructions and leveraging a domain-expert transformer alongside a pretrained VLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in vision-language-guided robotics: (1) limited language steerability when using reasoning as a condition, and (2) significant inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.

Method: MoTVLA uses a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) with a generalist VLM serving as perception/scene understanding/semantic planning, and a domain-expert transformer that shares knowledge with the VLM to generate fast, domain-specific reasoning (e.g., motion decomposition). The action policy is conditioned on the decomposed motion instructions. This enables fast-slow unified reasoning and improved policy execution.

Result: Empirical evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments show that MoTVLA achieves faster, more steerable, and more effective manipulation performance, outperforming baselines in both reasoning efficiency and task execution.

Conclusion: Integrating a domain-expert transformer with a pretrained VLM via a mixture-of-transformers framework yields a scalable approach to fast-slow reasoning for visuomotor policies, balancing generalist perception with domain-specific action planning to enhance language steerability and manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
(serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
reasoning and manipulation task performance.

### [207] [Coverage-Recon: Coordinated Multi-Drone Image Sampling with Online Map Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18347)
*Muhammad Hanif,Reiji Terunuma,Takumi Sumino,Kelvin Cheng,Takeshi Hatanaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Coverage-Recon is a real-time, multi-drone 3D reconstruction framework that uses online map feedback to adapt sampling. It employs a QP-based angle-aware coverage controller for coordinated flight, and NeuralRecon for on-the-fly mesh reconstruction, with reconstruction changes guiding the coverage strategy to yield more complete/accurate maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality 3D reconstructions from multiple drones require diverse viewpoints and adaptive coverage. Real-time feedback to guide drone motion is desirable but challenging due to evolving maps and uncertainty.

Method: A coordinated image sampling algorithm (Coverage-Recon) where drones are controlled by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage controller that enforces multi-viewpoint capture while ensuring safety. Real-time 3D mesh is produced by NeuralRecon from captured images. Reconstruction changes are interpreted as uncertainty indicators to update the coverage controller's importance index as the map evolves.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating online map feedback improves the completeness and accuracy of 3D reconstructions compared with conventional methods.

Conclusion: Integrating online map feedback into coverage control enables more effective real-time 3D reconstruction with better coverage, quality, and adaptability during flight.

Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:

### [208] [PGTT: Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal for Perceptive Legged Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18348)
*Alexandros Ntagkas,Chairi Kiourt,Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT) is a perception-aware deep-RL framework for legged locomotion that enforces gait structure via reward shaping rather than fixed priors. It uses per-leg phase encoded as cubic Hermite splines to adapt swing to terrain, enabling morphology-agnostic policies that are robust to noise, with faster learning and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art perceptive RL controllers for legged robots rely on oscillator/IK-based priors or operate 'blind', leading to biased policies or brittleness. There's a need for perception-aware, morphology-agnostic RL that leverages terrain information without heavy priors.

Method: Per-leg phase represented as cubic Hermite spline to adapt swing height to heightmap statistics; adds swing-phase contact penalty; policy learns in joint space. Trained in MuJoCo MJX on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization. Real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline on Unitree Go2; preliminary results on ANYmal-C with same hyperparameters.

Result: Outperforms baselines under push disturbances (+7.5% median) and discrete obstacles (+9%), maintains comparable velocity tracking, and converges ~2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines.

Conclusion: Terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping provides a simple, general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms, enabling morphology-agnostic deployment.

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged
robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the
action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability
across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to
anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we
propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL
approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely
through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning
compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase
as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap
statistics and adds a swing-phase contact penalty, while the policy acts
directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in
MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and
domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances
(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with
comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x
faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2
using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report
preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These
findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a
simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

*Mingxin Li,Haibo Hu,Jinghuai Deng,Yuchen Xi,Xinhong Chen,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: We propose MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform for quantitative, reproducible closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving, using a three-phase SOTIF-aligned testing process and a unified spatiotemporal measurement core. Validation shows 10.27 mm RMSE spatial accuracy and ~45 ms latency; Autoware case study reveals a critical performance cliff at 40 ms latency; enabling rigorous, interpretable analysis of autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of systematic, quantitative analysis support in miniaturized HIL platforms, enabling reliable performance evaluation while balancing fidelity, cost, and scalability.

Method: Develop a unified spatiotemporal measurement core integrated into a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform; define a three-phase SOTIF-oriented testing process; perform platform validation and Autoware-based case study to quantify baseline and identify performance cliffs.

Result: Platform achieves spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and stable closed-loop latency ~45 ms; Autoware case study shows performance baseline and a critical latency cliff at 40 ms; demonstrates reproducible, quantitative closed-loop evaluation.

Conclusion: A structured SOTIF-aligned process together with the unified benchmark core enables reproducible, interpretable quantitative evaluation of autonomous driving systems in miniaturized HIL testing.

Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test
fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework
supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their
value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose
MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized
testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative
analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic
three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended
Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the
performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning
systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a
unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring
consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through
comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a
spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of
approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged
this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a
critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows
that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified
spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and
quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

*Wanchen Li,Kahina Chalabi,Sabbah Maxime,Thomas Bousquet,Robin Passama,Sofiane Ramdani,Andrea Cherubini,Vincent Bonnet*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time action recognition framework for industrial settings that uses biomechanical joint angles from 2D cameras and a temporally smoothed Transformer, evaluated on a new 11-subject dataset, achieving 88% accuracy and enabling online human-robot interaction; it claims robustness to sensors, poses, and anthropometrics compared to JCP-based offline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust, real-time human action recognition in factories where pose variability, sensor differences, and real-time operation constrain performance. Prior work often relies on joint center positions and offline processing, which limits deployment. Biomechanical priors (joint angles) may offer better robustness and speed.

Method: A complete real-time pipeline: estimate 2D joint kinematics online, compute joint angles as features, and feed a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network for action recognition. Evaluated on a new dataset with 11 subjects performing diverse actions; demonstrates sensor- and subject-agnostic robustness and real-time performance. Validation includes a real-time online interaction with a simulated robot controlled by recognized actions.

Result: Outperforms the best baseline model, runs in real-time, achieves 88% accuracy, and generalizes to subjects not facing the camera. Demonstrates practical usefulness through online human-robot interaction with a simulated robot controlled by recognized actions.

Conclusion: Using biomechanical priors (joint angles) in a real-time Transformer-based recognition framework yields robust, real-time performance in industrial contexts and improves generalization across sensors and anthropometrics, enabling practical human-robot interaction.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
real-time via the recognized actions.

*Matthias Lorenzen,Teodoro Alamo,Martina Mammarella,Fabrizio Dabbene*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Novel MPC-based output-tracking control for non-holonomic robots with non-convex constraints, offering convergence guarantees to the target under realistic verifiable assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where much of output-tracking MPC assumes holonomic models and convex constraints; in practice, non-holonomic dynamics and non-convex constraints complicate guarantees of reaching the target.

Method: Develops a model predictive control formulation for output tracking applicable to non-holonomic systems with non-convex constraints; derives conditions under which closed-loop trajectories converge to the target.

Result: The proposed MPC guarantees convergence to the desired target under realistic, verifiable assumptions, extending motion-planning MPC to non-holonomic and non-convex settings where completeness was previously unsettled.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded MPC framework that bridges theory and practice by delivering convergence guarantees under practical assumptions for non-holonomic, non-convex motion planning.

Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for
motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for
non-holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the
advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several
papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC
it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the
state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented
publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness,
in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has
received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a
novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under
realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Online model-based RL learns a dynamics model from real-time data to update policies directly on real robots, yielding high sample efficiency with theoretical regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and bias of sim-to-real pipelines and model-free methods by enabling data-efficient, on-robot learning with formal performance guarantees.

Method: Build an online dynamics model from real-time interaction data and perform policy updates guided by the learned model; derive sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization assumptions; validate on real robotic platforms.

Result: Significant reduction in sample requirements compared to model-free methods; comparable performance within hours; robust adaptation to changing dynamics (payload randomization). Demonstrates strong practical sample efficiency and effective online learning in real-world robotics.

Conclusion: An effective, theoretically grounded path to efficient on-robot learning across challenging control tasks, reducing simulation bias and enabling rapid policy improvement directly on hardware.

Abstract: We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable
for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike
prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and
model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from
real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned
dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme
significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling
direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the
influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for
high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive
sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization
assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more
interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a
hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates
strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods,
reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting
dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our
approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a
broad class of challenging control tasks.

TL;DR: EfficientNav enables on-device zero-shot ObjNav with smaller LLMs by pruning map information and caching KV keys, achieving better success and much lower latency than GPT-4-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ObjNav with LLMs on-device faces challenges: large cloud LLMs are powerful but not on-device; small LLMs struggle understanding expansive navigation maps and long prompts cause latency. Need an on-device efficient solution.

Method: Introduce semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant navigation-map information; discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to compress and reuse KV caches; design for on-device LLMs to perform zero-shot ObjNav with reduced planning latency.

Result: 11.1% higher success rate on HM3D compared to GPT-4 baselines; 6.7x real-time latency reduction; 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction relative to GPT-4 planner.

Conclusion: EfficientNav shows that semantic pruning and cache-efficient memory techniques enable strong on-device ObjNav with smaller LLMs, reducing latency substantially and approaching or surpassing cloud-based baselines; code will be released.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
code will be released soon.

*Yue Wang,Lixian Zhang,Yimin Zhu,Yangguang Liu,Xuwei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A four-SVPN UAV named Flexbee integrates flight, grasping, and perching, enabling decoupled position and attitude control with high structural reuse, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for aerial robots that can reliably grasp and perch in unstructured environments. Traditional UAVs often separate flight and manipulation, leading to coupling and limited adaptability. This work aims to unify flight, grasping, and perching with a hardware-software stack that enables decoupled control and reuse.

Method: Design of a four-nozzle soft vector-propulsion UAV (SVPN) architecture named Flexbee. Development of a dynamics model for Flexbee with linearization of the equivalent moment to resolve nonlinear moment coupling. A hierarchical control strategy is proposed for two operational modes, followed by flight, grasping, and perching experiments to validate kinematics and control performance.

Result: A dynamics model was established and moment coupling was addressed via linearization. A hierarchical controller for the two modes was designed, and experimental validation demonstrated the feasibility of flight, grasping, and perching, confirming the effectiveness of the control strategy and the kinematic capabilities of Flexbee.

Conclusion: Flexbee demonstrates a compact, highly integrated UAV capable of flight, grasping, and perching with decoupled control and strong adaptability. The experimental results validate the approach and suggest potential for versatile manipulation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to design a new type of grasping and perching
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called Flexbee, which features a soft
vector-propulsion nozzle (SVPN). Compared to previous UAVs, Flexbee integrates
flight, grasping, and perching functionalities into the four SVPNs. This
integration offers advantages including decoupled position and attitude
control, high structural reuse, and strong adaptability strong adaptability for
grasping and perching. A dynamics model of Flexbee has been developed, and the
nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization
of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to
design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight,
grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's
kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Field experiments validate adaptive optimal control for quadruped locomotion in planetary-analog terrain (Vulcano campaign).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend planetary exploration capabilities by enabling legged robots to traverse difficult terrains, and to validate adaptive optimal control algorithms for quadrupedal locomotion in high-fidelity lunar/Martian analog environments.

Method: Field deployment on Vulcano Island as part of the AAPLE project; development and evaluation of state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for quadrupedal locomotion; creation of a high-fidelity analog environment; comprehensive technical approach, test plan, software architecture, deployment strategy, and evaluation on-site.

Result: Evaluation results from the Vulcano campaign indicating that the proposed adaptive optimal control methods perform effectively in challenging terrain, supporting feasibility for future planetary missions.

Conclusion: The Vulcano campaign validates the approach and provides a concrete foundation (methods, architecture, deployment strategy, and evaluation) for advancing quadrupedal locomotion on lunar/Martian analog surfaces and future field tests.

Abstract: Missions such as the Ingenuity helicopter have shown the advantages of using
novel locomotion modes to increase the scientific return of planetary
exploration missions. Legged robots can further expand the reach and capability
of future planetary missions by traversing more difficult terrain than wheeled
rovers, such as jumping over cracks on the ground or traversing rugged terrain
with boulders. To develop and test algorithms for using quadruped robots, the
AAPLE project was carried out at DFKI. As part of the project, we conducted a
series of field experiments on the Volcano on the Aeolian island of Vulcano, an
active stratovolcano near Sicily, Italy. The experiments focused on validating
newly developed state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for
quadrupedal locomotion in a high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar and
Martian surfaces. This paper presents the technical approach, test plan,
software architecture, field deployment strategy, and evaluation results from
the Vulcano campaign.

TL;DR: Proposes applying continual learning and compositionality to foundation models to enable flexible, efficient AI without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are powerful across domains but struggle to adapt to dynamic real-world scenarios without retraining from scratch; there is a need for more flexible and efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Apply continual learning and compositionality principles to foundation models to foster the development of more flexible, efficient, and smart AI systems.

Result: No empirical results are reported in this abstract; the paper presents a proposal or conceptual framework.

Conclusion: Integrating continual learning and compositionality is a promising direction for building adaptable and efficient AI systems based on foundation models.

Abstract: The birth of Foundation Models brought unprecedented results in a wide range

process huge quantities of data, and can extract and develop rich
representations, which can be employed across different domains and modalities.
However, they still have issues in adapting to dynamic, real-world scenarios

### [217] [Least Restrictive Hyperplane Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18643)
*Mattias Trende,Petter Ögren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Least restrictive Hyperplane-CBF: jointly optimize CBFs and safe controls to maximize alignment with a desired control while guaranteeing safety; introduces a smooth CBF parameterization and demonstrates on a double integrator with complex obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety guarantees via Control Barrier Functions are valuable but finding valid CBFs for complex unsafe sets and higher-order dynamics is hard and often conservative. The aim is to reduce conservativeness while preserving safety.

Method: Formulate an optimization that selects a combination of Hyperplane-CBFs and a safe control input to minimize deviation from the desired control, subject to CBF-based safety constraints; develop a smooth parameterization of the CBF family to enable optimization; validate on a double integrator with acceleration limits and arbitrarily shaped static/moving obstacles.

Result: The approach is illustrated on a double integrator with complex obstacle shapes and motions, showing that the least restrictive Hyperplane-CBF can closely track the desired control while maintaining safety, thanks to the smooth CBF parameterization and joint optimization.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing CBFs and safe controls reduces conservativeness relative to fixed Hyperplane-CBFs and preserves safety; provides a practical, smoothly parameterized CBF family suitable for higher-order systems and challenging obstacle environments.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Preliminary comparative study of walking vs torso-based sliding locomotion for quadruped rovers; identifies CoT crossover thresholds across slopes, friction, and speed via Isaac Sim and ANSYS-Rocky simulations to enable adaptive locomotive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address energy efficiency and safety concerns of legged rover locomotion on loose/inclined planetary terrains, by enabling adaptive switching between walking and sliding modes.

Method: Physics-based simulations in Isaac Sim to compute Cost of Transport for both modes over a matrix of slopes, friction conditions, and speeds; validation of particle interactions in ANSYS-Rocky; analysis of intersections of CoT curves to derive threshold conditions.

Result: Preliminary results show CoT curves for walking and sliding approach intersecting at certain conditions, suggesting threshold values where mode switching could improve efficiency. The work demonstrates feasibility of an adaptive approach.

Conclusion: An initial step toward developing adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary legged rovers; future work includes refining thresholds, extending to hardware experiments, and integrating control policies.

Abstract: Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
legged rovers.

*Phuoc Nguyen,Francesco Verdoja,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces Event-Grounding Graph (EGG), a framework that links spatial scene features to dynamic events to enable rich spatio-temporal queries for robotic understanding; validated on real robotic data and released as open-source with code and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between static semantic scene representations and dynamic events; robots need to connect spatial features with events (e.g., linking a blue mug to the action of washing) to reason about and respond to human inquiries.

Method: Proposes the Event-Grounding Graph (EGG) framework that grounds event interactions to spatial features, enabling perception, reasoning, and response to complex spatio-temporal queries. Demonstrated with real robotic data; code and evaluation dataset released as open-source.

Result: EGG can retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human inquiries about the environment and events, validated on real robotic data.

Conclusion: EGG provides a principled approach to couple spatial representations with dynamic events, enabling richer spatio-temporal understanding for autonomous robots. The project resources are released openly (GitHub).

Abstract: A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can
assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental
representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched
robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between
spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event
washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a
framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This
representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex
spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's
capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human
inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG
framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:

### [220] [Sharing the Load: Distributed Model-Predictive Control for Precise Multi-Rover Cargo Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18766)
*Alexander Krawciw,Sven Lilge,Luka Antonyshyn,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Distributed MPC for multi-vehicle cargo convoys achieves near-centralized performance with real-time, map-based coordination without GNSS, maintaining ~20 cm spacing over 10+ km using 2- and 3-vehicle rovers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In autonomous cargo transport, fleets of mobile robots offer greater flexibility but require precise inter-vehicle spacing and path tracking. A distributed MPC approach with map-based localization (no GNSS) aims to provide scalable, real-time convoying comparable to centralized methods.

Method: Develop a distributed model-predictive controller that leverages a shared map and lidar-based path-tracking (lidar teach-and-repeat). Compare against a centralized MPC and a baseline that directly measures inter-vehicle distance. Evaluate four convoyed path trackers over ~10 km, with convoys of two and three rovers, in real-time to maintain spacing within 20 cm of the target.

Result: Nominal performance of the distributed MPC matches that of the centralized MPC. A direct inter-vehicle distance measurement improves close-range tracking but degrades long-range offset handling. The distributed approach enables real-time convoying and maintains maximum spacing within 20 cm under various conditions over 10+ km.

Conclusion: Distributing computation in convoying provides operational flexibility and scalability, making map-based convoying viable for real deployments while achieving comparable performance to centralized controllers.

Abstract: For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more
operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of
lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a
Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.
Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other
without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized
MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.
The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex
centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between
the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range
scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility
provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real
deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km
of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the
proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying
to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

*Emad Razavi,Angelo Bratta,João Carlos Virgolino Soares,Carmine Recchiuto,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Online semantic object mapping for a quadruped robot builds a persistent, queryable object layer by fusing range data and camera detections into a global map, maintaining object identities across frames and viewpoint changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust, real-time semantic mapping for indoor quadruped robotics by converting detections into named objects in a global map, ensuring persistence, avoiding duplicates, and supporting planning.

Method: Online fusion of range geometry with camera detections; within-frame merging of co-located detections; cross-frame data association to create persistent object instances; persistence of objects even when out of view; repeated sightings update existing instances; output is a compact, queryable object layer (class, pose, confidence) integrated with the occupancy map and usable by a planner.

Result: A compact, persistent semantic object layer that remains stable across viewpoint changes in on-robot tests; objects are preserved when out of view and duplicates are avoided; layer is integrated with the occupancy map for planner access.

Conclusion: The approach yields a robust, real-time semantic mapping solution for indoor quadruped navigation, providing persistent object identities and a stable, planner-friendly map representation across viewpoints.

Abstract: We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot
operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named
objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry
with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and
associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames.
Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings
update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a
compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is
integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests,
the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MADR introduces MPC-guided Adversarial DeepReach to approximate two-player zero-sum differential-game value functions, yielding optimal strategies for both players and robust safety policies; it overcomes dimensionality and convergence limits of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and outperforms baselines in high-dimensional robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend reachability-based safety and physics-informed deep learning to two-player zero-sum games, addressing the curse of dimensionality, slow convergence, and single-player limitations to enable robust, scalable multi-agent safety.

Method: Propose MADR, a general framework that fuses model-predictive control (MPC) guidance with adversarial deep reachability learning and regular supervision aligned to optimal-control structure, to robustly approximate the differential game value function for both players and extract their optimal strategies, yielding safe policies.

Result: MADR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in high-dimensional simulations across varied dynamics and games, and demonstrates impressive hardware results, validating scalable, robust two-player reachability learning.

Conclusion: MADR provides a scalable, general approach to robustly approximate two-player zero-sum differential game value functions and derive optimal strategies, extending reachability-informed learning beyond single-player problems and enabling real-world, worst-case robust safety in high-dimensional robotic systems.

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.

### [223] [Activation Manifold Projection: Liberating Task-Specific Behaviors from LLM Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17902)
*Al Kari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAST enables zero-shot cross-architecture transfer of LoRA adapters by learning activation-space mappings, achieving 85-95% of fully retrained performance and outperforming weight-space transfers, setting new interoperability state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address architectural lock-in where LoRA behaviors are trapped in the source model; existing transfer methods align static weights—an indirect and brittle approach—while neglecting the geometry of activations. A direct, geometry-aware transfer in activation space offers a more robust path to interoperability.

Method: Learn a non-linear mapping between activation manifolds of two diverse LLMs to translate the target model's activation stream into the source model's latent space, apply a frozen LoRA kernel, and project the result back. The LoRA adapter is treated as a frozen behavioral kernel. Train a pair of lightweight, bidirectional projection heads on general text data (no task-specific data). This yields zero-shot translation of LoRA adapters across architectures.

Result: Empirical evaluations show CAST-translated adapters reach 85-95% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model. CAST outperforms existing weight-space transfer methods and establishes a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability, demonstrated with transfers between heterogeneous model families such as Llama-2 and Mistral.

Conclusion: CAST provides a direct, architecture-agnostic mechanism to decouple LoRA-acquired skills from their source architecture, enabling true zero-shot transfer of adapters and significantly improving cross-model interoperability.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

*Zhiming Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diversity-aware in-context exemplar retrieval improves budget-constrained multi-turn intent understanding with gains in Joint Goal Accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, across various exemplar counts and backbone sizes, offering a deployable principle for budget-limited DST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under tight token budgets, conventional retrieval focuses on relevance but can hurt performance due to lack of diversity and exemplar order; explore whether diversity in retrieved prompts improves LLM-based DST.

Method: Propose a diversity-aware retrieval framework selecting exemplars to balance intent coverage and linguistic variety; integrate with standard LLM decoders; evaluate with budget-matched prompts, randomized exemplar positions, and sensitivity analyses over exemplar counts, diversity strength, and backbone size; datasets: MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD.

Result: Achieves strong gains in Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, outperforming strong LLM/DST baselines; gains robust for K from 4 to 7; moderate latency.

Conclusion: Content diversity in retrieval is a key driver for accuracy in budget-constrained multi-turn intent systems; provides a simple, deployable exemplar selection principle that improves performance without increasing token budgets.

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an LL-only pipeline to synthesize complete agentic interaction records (task specs, tool calls, execution traces) using modular generation, strict schema validation, and judge-based filtering to enable scalable, multi-task data for tool-use in agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate costly human annotation in creating agentic data, by generating rich, structured, tool-use records that couple intents, tool specs, policy calls, exchanges, and traces.

Method: Modular pipelines generate complete interaction records: task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural-language exchanges, and execution traces. Enforced by syntactic/semantic constraints, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based filtering. Supports multi-task and multi-turn interactions with constrained generation formats and prompt design principles.

Result: A scalable, reproducible LL-only framework that yields high-quality, machine-parseable agentic datasets, aligning inputs, outputs, and tool calls across tasks and turns, suitable as a replacement for manual data collection.

Conclusion: LLMs can autonomously generate faithful, structured agentic data, enabling robust tool use and accelerating the development of agentic LLMs without human supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to
decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.
Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured
interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,
argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting
such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only
LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes
generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records
spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural
language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic
and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment
across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support
for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the
construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use
competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates
constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based
filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the
prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable
pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible,
LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of
agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

*Zhenyu Bi,Meng Lu,Yang Li,Swastik Roy,Weijie Guan,Morteza Ziyadi,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent verbal reinforcement learning framework (OURS) dynamically builds collaboration structures and evaluates communication quality to improve reasoning, achieving superior results over single-agent prompts and existing multi-agent methods via majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent setups either use predefined collaboration structures or rely on voting/debate mechanics that can suppress valuable but less dominant insights. Moreover, graph-based approaches optimize for agent performance rather than interaction quality, suggesting that improved communication could boost collective reasoning.

Method: OURS defines action spaces for agent communication and implements a feedback mechanism that judges communication robustness and coherence throughout debates, allowing the system to dynamically construct and refine collaboration structures. The final decision is made by a majority vote over all agents.

Result: Empirically, OURS significantly outperforms single-agent prompting and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.

Conclusion: Dynamic, communication-aware multi-agent collaboration can enhance reasoning performance; interactive debate quality—and not just agent competence—drives gains, with majority-vote aggregation delivering robust final decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the

### [227] [Subject-Event Ontology Without Global Time: Foundations and Execution Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18040)
*Alexander Boldachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A subject-centered ontology for modeling dynamic systems without global time, introducing events as subject fixations and happens-before causality, executable via a deterministic declarative dataflow (BSL), bounded by nine axioms (A1-A9) and three history/causality conditions (I1-I3); demonstrated on Boldsea workflow engine, with applicability to distributed systems, microservices, DLTs, and multiperspective scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex, dynamic systems where global time is unavailable or undesirable, by framing changes as subjects fixing events based on internal models; ensure determinism, traceability, and verifiability, and accommodate conflicting facts from multiple subjects.

Method: Formalize events as fixations, define causal order via explicit dependencies (happens-before) rather than timestamps, enforce executable declarative dataflow semantics for determinism, treat models as epistemic filters (restricted by known concepts), adopt a presumption of truth for event content, and encode nine axioms (A1-A9) with three integrity conditions (I1-I3). Emphasize model-based approach (A9) with schemas, actor authorization, and automatic construction of causal chains (W3) without global time. Implement and validate in Boldsea Semantic Language (BSL) within the Boldsea workflow engine (boldsea system).

Result: A coherent formal framework for executable ontologies with time-free causality, including monotonic history, acyclic causality, and traceability guarantees; supports event validation, authorization, and automatic causal-chain construction; experimentally demonstrated within the Boldsea system and applicable to distributed/microservice/DLT environments and in scenarios with conflicting multi-subject perspectives.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, executable ontology approach for distributed systems lacking global time, delivering determinism, traceability, and schema-driven validation; it is practical via the Boldsea platform and broadly applicable to modern architectures requiring multiperspective reasoning about events.

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

*Joong Ho Choi,Jiayang Zhao,Jeel Shah,Ritvika Sonawane,Vedant Singh,Avani Appalla,Will Flanagan,Filipe Condessa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompactPrompt compresses prompts and documents via token pruning and data compression to cut LLM inference costs by up to 60% with minimal accuracy impact on benchmarks like TAT-QA and FinQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deliver powerful reasoning but incur high runtime costs in agentic workflows with long prompts and data streams; reducing token and data footprint is essential for efficient, scalable AI pipelines.

Method: A two-pronged pipeline: (1) hard prompt compression using self-information scoring to prune low-information tokens and dependency-based phrase grouping; (2) data compression via n-gram abbreviation for recurring patterns in documents and uniform quantization for numerical columns; integrated end-to-end into standard LLM agents.

Result: Token usage and inference cost reductions up to 60% observed on benchmarks (TAT-QA, FinQA); output quality preserved with under ~5% accuracy drop for Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1-Mini; provides real-time visualization of compression decisions and cost-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: CompactPrompt demonstrates a viable end-to-end approach for leaner generative AI pipelines, enabling cost-aware decision making and paving the way for scalable deployment in agentic workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

### [229] [Planned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18087)
*Daniel Israel,Tian Jin,Ellie Cheng,Guy Van den Broeck,Aditya Grover,Suvinay Subramanian,Michael Carbin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid planned diffusion improves speed-quality trade-off by planning an autoregressive outline of spans and then diffusing spans in parallel; shows Pareto-optimal results on AlpacaEval with notable speedups and small loss in win rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the speed limit of autoregressive generation and the inefficiency of diffusion, by combining both paradigms into a two-stage process.

Method: Stage 1: generate a short autoregressive plan that partitions output into independent spans. Stage 2: generate spans in parallel using diffusion. The model includes runtime knobs to control quality-latency. A sensitivity analysis analyzes planning overhead.

Result: On AlpacaEval (805 prompts), achieved Pareto-optimal trade-off; speedups 1.27x to 1.81x over autoregressive with 0.87%-5.4% drop in win rate. Planning mechanism is minimal; reliable and tunable.

Conclusion: Planned diffusion expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and offers a practical path to fast, high-quality text generation, with simple controls to trade off quality and latency.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

### [230] [SMaRT: Select, Mix, and ReinvenT -- A Strategy Fusion Framework for LLM-Driven Reasoning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18095)
*Nikhil Verma,Manasa Bharadwaj,Wonjun Jang,Harmanpreet Singh,Yixiao Wang,Homa Fashandi,Chul Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMaRT fuses multiple reasoning strategies in LLMs (select, mix, reinvenT) to create balanced, efficient solutions by using LLMs as integrators rather than mere evaluators, yielding robust performance across reasoning, planning, and sequential decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-strategy prompting is insufficient; combining diverse reasoning approaches can achieve better robustness and performance; LLMs can intelligently integrate strategies.

Method: Introduce SMaRT framework; design cross-strategy calibration; use LLMs as integrators to merge insights from multiple strategies; evaluate on reasoning, planning, sequential decision-making benchmarks; compare to state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: Achieves superior solution quality, better constraint adherence, and improved performance metrics across tasks; exhibits robustness and adaptability across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Presents a new paradigm in LLM-driven decision-making, highlighting cross-strategy fusion as a path to stronger, self-refining reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent
integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive
empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential
decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution
quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines
LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy
calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing
the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

### [231] [Measuring Reasoning in LLMs: a New Dialectical Angle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18134)
*Soheil Abbasloo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dialectics-based evaluation (SIEV) for LLM reasoning is proposed, shifting focus from final correctness to the reasoning process. It reveals reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models on GSM and MMLU, with GPT-5-chat dropping over 40 points on GSM under SIEV, suggesting process-focused metrics are more discriminative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks reward correct answers but neglect the reasoning process. The authors argue for a dynamic, dialectical view of reasoning (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) to better diagnose how models arrive at conclusions and to expose hidden weaknesses.

Method: Introduce SIEV, a structured dialectical framework that assesses not just conclusions but the reasoning trajectory: how ideas clash, converge, resolve tension, and yield higher-order insights. Apply this framework to established benchmarks (GSM, MMLU) and to models like GPT-5-chat to compare process-oriented evaluation with traditional metrics.

Result: SIEV uncovers substantial reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even on saturated benchmarks. Notably, GPT-5-chat loses over 40 points on GSM when evaluated with SIEV, illustrating that strong final answers may mask flawed reasoning processes.

Conclusion: A process-oriented, philosophically grounded evaluation yields deeper, more discriminative insights into LLM reasoning than correctness-focused metrics, advocating for dialectical analysis as a valuable augmentation of standard benchmarks.

Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current
evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but
correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this
work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of
steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into
deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established
philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a
structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.
Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model
reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate
distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers
significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated
benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses
over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings
highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach
enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM
reasoning.

*Huan Song,Deeksha Razdan,Yiyue Qian,Arijit Ghosh Chowdhury,Parth Patwa,Aman Chadha,Shinan Zhang,Sharlina Keshava,Hannah Marlowe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaDA-Agent is an evaluation-driven data augmentation framework for small language models. It identifies failure patterns from validation data and crafts targeted augmentation strategies to close the generalization gap, outperforming existing LLM-based augmentation methods when fine-tuning Llama 3.2 1B Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models are cost- and latency-efficient but lag in accuracy on complex domain tasks. Supervised fine-tuning helps but requires substantial data preparation and iterative optimization. Current augmentation methods typically target model training errors and generate error-correcting samples, which may not directly reduce generalization gaps.

Method: PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data Augmentation Agent) uses evaluation signals from validation data to uncover failure patterns and then drafts targeted, coordinated data augmentation strategies aimed at directly reducing generalization error. It shifts the focus from correcting training errors to preventing generalization gaps, and is applied to fine-tune Llama 3.2 1B Instruct.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based data augmentation approaches for fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model.

Conclusion: Evaluation-driven, pattern-guided data augmentation can more effectively reduce the generalization gap for small language models than conventional error-focused augmentation, offering a data-efficient path to closing the accuracy gap relative to larger models.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

*Antonio-Gabriel Chacón Menke,Phan Xuan Tan,Eiji Kamioka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes activation-level safety monitoring for LLM reasoning using sentence-level, labeled safety-behavior data to extract steering vectors that detect and influence unsafe reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-only, holistic analyses of chain-of-thought can miss subtle harmful patterns and be evaded by models that hide reasoning. The work seeks finer-grained, activation-level signals to improve safety oversight during reasoning.

Method: Provide a sentence-level labeled dataset of reasoning sequences with safety-behavior annotations. Use these annotations to derive steering vectors from model activations to detect and steer safety-related behaviors during reasoning. Evaluate by showing representations that can both detect and influence safety behaviors within activations.

Result: Demonstrates that activation-level representations can detect safety behaviors and can be used to steer or influence them within model activations, indicating a promising direction for safety monitoring beyond holistic reasoning analyses.

Conclusion: Activation-level monitoring fills a gap between holistic datasets and precise, time-specific safety detection, offering a pathway to more effective safety oversight in reasoning; further work needed to validate robustness, generalize across models, and address potential manipulation of steering vectors.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

*Man-Lin Chu,Lucian Terhorst,Kadin Reed,Tom Ni,Weiwei Chen,Rongyu Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework models consumer decisions and social dynamics to enable scalable, pre-implementation testing of marketing strategies, outperforming rule-based ABMs in capturing emergent social patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive fidelity in consumer decision-making simulations and reduce post-event evaluation reliance, addressing limitations of rule-based ABMs in capturing complex social behavior.

Method: A sandbox-enabled, multi-agent system where generative agents interact, reveal internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without predefined rules, built on recent LLM-simulation advances and tested in a price-discount scenario.

Result: The framework yields actionable strategy-testing outcomes and uncovers emergent social patterns that conventional methods miss, demonstrating potential for scalable, low-risk pre-implementation testing.

Conclusion: LLM-powered multi-agent simulations offer marketers a scalable and low-risk alternative to post-event analyses, enabling earlier testing and reducing the chance of underperforming campaigns.

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,
express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without
predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers
actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns
beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a
scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on
time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming
campaigns.

### [235] [Saber: An Efficient Sampling with Adaptive Acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking for Diffusion Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18165)
*Yihong Dong,Zhaoyu Ma,Xue Jiang,Zhiyuan Fan,Jiaru Qian,Yongmin Li,Jianha Xiao,Zhi Jin,Rongyu Cao,Binhua Li,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Saber is a training-free sampling algorithm for diffusion language models that adaptively accelerates code-generation sampling and uses a backtracking step to reverse tokens, achieving faster and higher-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models enable parallel generation and bidirectional context, but code generation suffers from a sharp speed–quality trade-off. Training-free methods that preserve quality while speeding up inference are highly desirable.

Method: Saber (Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced Remasking) introduces adaptive acceleration that increases as more context is established and a backtracking mechanism to reverse generated tokens. It is training-free and relies on efficient remasking to reflect changes.

Result: On multiple code-generation benchmarks, Saber yields an average Pass@1 improvement of 1.9% over mainstream DLM sampling methods and achieves an average 251.4% inference speedup (roughly 2.5× faster).

Conclusion: Saber significantly narrows the gap between diffusion language models and autoregressive models for code generation by boosting speed without sacrificing quality, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

*Manik Rana,Calissa Man,Anotida Expected Msiiwa,Jeffrey Paine,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma,Ahan M R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench defines a benchmark to study agent adaptation to mid-dialog goal shifts in tool-augmented LMs, using four metrics across 2,835 task sequences and five personas; results reveal that high raw accuracy masks robustness gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-turn interactions involve dynamic goals; current benchmarks emphasize static objectives. There is a need for metrics that capture effectiveness, reliability, efficiency, and adaptation latency to diagnose and improve agent resilience in enterprise workflows.

Method: Proposes four complementary metrics (Task Success Rate, Tool Use Efficiency, Tool Call Redundancy Rate, Goal-Shift Recovery Time) and evaluates 2,835 task sequences across five user personas on frontier models to measure adaptation to mid-dialog goal shifts in three enterprise domains; provides a reproducible testbed.

Result: Finds sharp contrasts not visible with pass@k: GPT-4o achieves about 92.2% recovery on airline booking shifts, Gemini about 48.6%; retail tasks show high parameter validity but redundancy rates >80%, implying inefficient tool usage; overall shows that raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals.

Conclusion: AgentChangeBench offers a reproducible framework to diagnose and improve agent resilience under changing goals in realistic enterprise settings, underscoring the importance of measuring recovery time and redundancy in addition to traditional accuracy.

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

*Soumya Rani Samineni,Durgesh Kalwar,Vardaan Gangal,Siddhant Bhambri,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL post-training improves trace coherence of intermediate reasoning steps but does not guarantee valid final answers; token-level gains may not translate to correct solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether RLVR affects intermediate tokens and reasoning traces, not just final accuracy, by introducing a trace coherence measure and distinguishing trace validity from coherence.

Method: Use GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B on GSM8K; define a First-Order Logic-based trace coherence metric; compare trace validity (logical soundness) vs trace coherence (local consistency); analyze where RL post-training yields improvements.

Result: RL post-training enhances trace coherence, especially on problems where the base model fails but the RL model succeeds; it improves local coherence without necessarily producing valid or correct final solutions.

Conclusion: Caution is needed when claiming improved reasoning from RL; higher trace coherence does not guarantee valid proofs or correct answers, so evaluations should include trace-level metrics and correctness checks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning
tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,
however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for
token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on
final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL
post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our
investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which
are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup
using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We
introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture
the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We
distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former
implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of
errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence
with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the
RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without
necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial
distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee
final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL
must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,
which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a quantifiable AGI framework grounded in CHC theory, assessing AI across ten cognitive domains to measure AGI as the cognitive performance of a well-educated adult, revealing a jagged profile and a substantial remaining gap (GPT-4 ≈ 27%, GPT-5 ≈ 58%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the lack of a concrete, measurable definition of AGI and provide a theory-grounded framework for evaluating AI systems against human cognitive benchmarks.

Method: Ground the framework in Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory, decompose general intelligence into ten cognitive domains (including reasoning, memory, and perception), and adapt established human psychometric batteries to evaluate AI systems.

Result: Application reveals a highly jagged cognitive profile in contemporary models: strong performance in knowledge-intensive domains but deficits in foundational cognitive machinery, notably long-term memory storage; provides quantified AGI scores showing rapid progress but substantial remaining gap (e.g., GPT-4 ≈ 27%, GPT-5 ≈ 58%).

Conclusion: The framework enables quantifiable tracking of AGI progress and highlights critical targets for improvement; current models show meaningful gains but are still far from human-level general cognition.

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

### [240] [ssToken: Self-modulated and Semantic-aware Token Selection for LLM Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18250)
*Xiaohan Qin,Xiaoxing Wang,Ning Liao,Cancheng Zhang,Xiangdong Zhang,Mingquan Feng,Jingzhi Wang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ssToken combines self-modulated per-token loss differences from history models with semantic-aware, attention-based token importance to select informative tokens for supervised fine-tuning, achieving data-efficient improvements and surpassing prior token-level methods and full-data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality is crucial for effective supervised fine-tuning of large language models. Existing token-level selection methods have two main drawbacks: they rely on training or accessing an extra reference model, and they use only loss information, which can overlook semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based metrics.

Method: ssToken uses history models to compute per-token loss differences as a self-modulated signal, guiding adaptive token selection along the optimization trajectory. It also introduces a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimator that provides complementary semantic information independent of loss-based selection. Both signals can be used jointly for token filtering during SFT.

Result: Experiments across model families and scales show that self-modulated selection and semantic-aware selection outperform full-data fine-tuning when used alone. Their integration, ssToken, yields synergistic gains and surpasses prior token-level selection methods while maintaining training efficiency.

Conclusion: ssToken delivers complementary, orthogonal signals for token-level data selection, enabling more effective and efficient SFT of LLMs by combining self-modulation with semantic-aware token importance.

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

### [241] [Illusions of reflection: open-ended task reveals systematic failures in Large Language Models' reflective reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18254)
*Sion Weatherhead,Flora Salim,Aaron Belbasis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open-ended constraint tasks show that current LLM 'reflection' yields only modest gains, largely by chance, and performance worsens as task openness increases. There is no evidence of functional, goal-directed self-monitoring in these models; external constraint enforcement is required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI 'reflection' demonstrates true, goal-driven self-monitoring like human reflective reasoning, beyond the improvements seen in closed-ended tasks.

Method: Evaluate eight frontier LLMs on a real-world, rule-constrained but open-ended task: produce valid scientific test items and then revise after considering the model's critique; quantify first-pass validity, gains from reflection, and second-pass performance across varying levels of open-endedness.

Result: First-pass performance is poor (often 0 valid items out of 4; mean ~1). Reflection yields only modest gains (also ~1). The second attempt frequently repeats the same constraint violations, suggesting gains arise from chance rather than principled error detection and repair. Performance declines as open-endedness increases; models marketed for 'reasoning' show no advantage.

Conclusion: LLM reflection currently lacks functional evidence of active, goal-driven monitoring. To achieve reliable performance on constraint-limited tasks, external structure that enforces constraints is needed, or mechanisms must be instantiated within the model itself.

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

### [242] [Genesis: Evolving Attack Strategies for LLM Web Agent Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18314)
*Zheng Zhang,Jiarui He,Yuchen Cai,Deheng Ye,Peilin Zhao,Ruili Feng,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Genesis is a novel agentic red-teaming framework for web agents that continuously evolves attack strategies via three modules: Attacker (genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation), Scorer, and Strategist. It discovers novel adversarial strategies and consistently outperforms existing baselines across diverse web tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-enabled LLM agents pose new security risks; existing red-teaming methods rely on manual or offline models, which fail to capture evolving behavioral patterns and generalize across environments. There is a need for adaptive, continuous discovery of attack strategies that can evolve with agent behavior.

Method: Genesis comprises three modules: Attacker generates adversarial injections using a genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation; Scorer evaluates the web agent's responses to provide feedback; Strategist analyzes interaction logs to uncover effective strategies and expands a growing strategy library, which is redeployed to improve the Attacker over time.

Result: Extensive experiments across various web tasks show Genesis discovers novel strategies and consistently outperforms existing attack baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables continuous evolution of attack strategies, improving red-teaming effectiveness against web agents and providing a scalable, evolving library of attack strategies for diverse environments.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

TL;DR: Earth AI introduces a Gemini-powered geospatial AI stack with three domain foundation models and agentic reasoning to deliver advanced, timely geospatial insights from diverse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial data volume, diversity, and sparsity across varying resolutions and timescales impede analysis; a unified, scalable AI framework is needed to convert raw data into actionable planetary insights, including crisis response.

Method: Develop foundation models across Planet-scale Imagery, Population, and Environment; implement a Gemini-powered reasoning engine; create an agent that jointly reasons over models and external data/tools; benchmark on real-world crisis scenarios.

Result: Benchmarks show the models provide complementary value and, when combined, yield superior geospatial inference; the agent demonstrates timely, actionable insights in crisis scenarios.

Conclusion: A unified Earth AI framework, integrating multi-domain foundation models with intelligent agent reasoning, can unlock deeper geospatial understanding and faster crisis-informed decision making.

Abstract: Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet.
However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied
resolutions, timescales, and sparsity pose significant challenges for thorough
analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces Earth AI, a family of
geospatial AI models and agentic reasoning that enables significant advances in
our ability to unlock novel and profound insights into our planet. This
approach is built upon foundation models across three key domains--Planet-scale

capabilities of our foundation models and validate that when used together,
they provide complementary value for geospatial inference and their synergies
unlock superior predictive capabilities. To handle complex, multi-step queries,
we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple
foundation models along with large geospatial data sources and tools. On a new
benchmark of real-world crisis scenarios, our agent demonstrates the ability to
deliver critical and timely insights, effectively bridging the gap between raw
geospatial data and actionable understanding.

### [244] [ShortcutBreaker: Low-Rank Noisy Bottleneck with Global Perturbation Attention for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18342)
*Peng Tang,Xiaoxiao Yan,Xiaobin Hu,Yuning Cui,Donghao Luo,Jiangning Zhang,Pengcheng Xu,Jinlong Peng,Qingdong He,Feiyue Huang,Song Xue,Tobias Lasser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified MUAD framework, ShortcutBreaker, mitigates identity shortcuts in transformer-based models by (1) a low-rank noisy bottleneck to enforce compact latent representations and (2) a global perturbation attention in decoders, achieving state-of-the-art AUROC across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MUAD aims to detect anomalies across multiple object classes with a single model to save computation, but current methods suffer from identity shortcuts that copy inputs, reducing reconstruction gaps between normal and abnormal cases. This work seeks to close that gap.

Method: Introduce LRNB (low-rank noisy bottleneck) grounded in matrix rank inequality to project high-dimensional features into a low-rank latent space, preventing trivial identity reproduction. Add a global perturbation attention mechanism leveraging ViTs to curb information shortcuts in decoders, enabling global context modeling for MUAD.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (MVTec-AD, ViSA, Real-IAD, Universal Medical) show image-level AUROCs of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8%, respectively, outperforming prior MUAD methods.

Conclusion: ShortcutBreaker effectively mitigates identity shortcuts in MUAD by combining a principled low-rank bottleneck and a global perturbation attention, delivering strong anomaly detection performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

TL;DR: MASMP combines memory with a language-driven state-machine prompting framework to create more reliable, coherent LLM agents in RTS games, achieving strong performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in LLM-based agents; need long-term tactical coherence and interpretable control in complex, real-time tasks like StarCraft II.

Method: Introduce MASMP: (i) natural-language-driven state-machine prompts that steer LLMs to emulate finite state machines and behavior trees, and (ii) a lightweight memory module that preserves strategic variables across decision cycles (e.g., tactics, priority units). Evaluate on StarCraft II against strong AI.

Result: Achieves 60% win rate against Lv7 AI, outperforming baselines (0%); case studies show preserved semantic understanding and resolution of Knowing-Doing Gap via strict state-action mapping; offers interpretability and FSM-like reliability.

Conclusion: This work advances neural-symbolic AI for complex decision making; demonstrates a new paradigm for integrating neural LLMs with structured symbolic reasoning to improve reliability and coherence in real-time strategy tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel
framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges
like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,
MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify
structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:
(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to
emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a
lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,
priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate
MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly
outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'
semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict

### [246] [Heterogeneous Adversarial Play in Interactive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18407)
*Manjie Xu,Xinyi Yang,Jiayu Zhan,Wei Liang,Chi Zhang,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Adversarial Play (HAP) introduces a bidirectional, minimax-based curriculum learning framework that models asymmetric teacher-student dynamics to adapt task difficulty in real-time, achieving state-of-the-art parity while producing curricula that benefit both AI agents and human learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended learning with inherent asymmetry cannot be captured by symmetric self-play; human pedagogy provides adaptive, task-calibrating frameworks that need to be operationalized in AI to autonomously generate curricula without fixed task hierarchies.

Method: Formulate teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization in which a task-generating instructor and a problem-solving learner co-evolve through adversarial dynamics. Unlike static curricula, HAP uses bidirectional feedback to continuously recalibrate task complexity based on real-time learner performance. Validation spans multi-task domains, comparing against state-of-the-art baselines; includes both artificial agents and human-subject experiments.

Result: The framework achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines and yields curricula that enhance learning efficacy for both artificial agents and human learners.

Conclusion: HAP demonstrates a viable path for asymmetric automatic curriculum learning, enabling autonomous, learner-responsive curricula and improving learning outcomes in open-ended settings for AI and human collaborators.

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

changes based on the current production setup. Through a specifically designed
inversion mechanism, the algorithm identifies the optimal machine settings
required to achieve the desired glass gob characteristics. Experimental results
on historical datasets from multiple production lines show that the proposed
method yields promising outcomes, suggesting potential for enhanced process
stability, reduced waste, and improved product consistency. These results
highlight the potential of deep learning to process control in glass

Method: Present Med-VRAgent, an agent framework that integrates Visual Guidance with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Self-Reward principles. The agent explores reasoning trajectories, uses MCTS to search over potential explanations, and collects trajectories to fine-tune the base VLM using proximal policy optimization (PPO).

Result: On multiple medical VQA benchmarks, Med-VRAgent outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating improved medical visual reasoning performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-VRAgent framework enhances medical VLM reasoning by combining guided visual exploration with tree search and policy optimization, yielding better accuracy and potentially more trustworthy, localized reasoning on medical tasks.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning
but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and
poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical

combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the
medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories

fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.
Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method

TL;DR: A foundation-model–driven framework (UWAssess) for automatic waterlogging detection and reporting from surveillance images, using semi-supervised fine-tuning and chain-of-thought prompting; improves perception and generates reliable textual reports, enabling scalable urban waterlogging monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies urban waterlogging and threatens public safety and infrastructure. Current monitoring relies on manual reporting and lacks timely, comprehensive assessment. There is a need for scalable, data-efficient tools, especially given limited labeled data.

Method: Introduce UWAssess, a foundation-model–driven framework that jointly handles perception (identifying waterlogged areas) and report generation. Employ semi-supervised fine-tuning to cope with scarce labeled data and chain-of-thought prompting to enhance downstream reasoning. Evaluate on challenging visual benchmarks and via GPT-based assessment to verify both perception and textual reporting.

Result: Significant improvements in perception performance on visual benchmarks. GPT-based evaluations show the generated textual reports reliably describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk, and impact.

Conclusion: The approach shifts waterlogging monitoring from perception to generation; the collaborative multi-model framework offers scalable, intelligent systems to support urban management, disaster response, and climate resilience.

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban
management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaOPT introduces a self-improving, library-based learning framework that enables LLMs to learn from limited demonstrations and solver feedback without annotated reasoning traces, through a two-phase Library Learning and Library Evolution cycle, leading to continual improvement and interpretable knowledge. It achieves higher accuracy and better transfer on OptiBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating optimization modeling is hard due to informal-to-formal translation; existing LLM approaches rely on brittle prompts or expensive retraining with limited generalization; need data-efficient, interpretable, and continual learning.

Method: Two-phase continual loop: Library Learning extracts solver-verified, structured insights (taxonomy, condition, explanation, example) from failed attempts; Library Evolution diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines applicability conditions. Learns from answers without gold programs; updates the library rather than model weights; no annotated rationales required.

Result: Empirical results show performance gains as data increases (65% to 72% with 100 to 300 items) and a 7.7% improvement over the strongest baseline on out-of-distribution OptiBench when trained only on answers; code/data available.

Conclusion: Design makes knowledge explicit and interpretable, enables efficient learning from limited demonstrations, and supports continual expansion without retraining, with demonstrated transfer across tasks.

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanU integrates quantile-based return modeling in Monte Carlo Tree Search for LLM-driven planning, using an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to handle both LLM and environmental uncertainty; experiments show improved decision-making under stochastic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs introduce sampling-based uncertainty and decision tasks often occur in environments with stochastic state transitions; existing LDM approaches focus on LLM uncertainty (e.g., multiple reasoning chains) but neglect environmental uncertainty, hindering multi-step planning.

Method: PlanU models the return of each MCTS node as a distribution captured by a set of quantiles. It introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity (UCC) score to balance exploration and exploitation by estimating node uncertainty, enabling robust planning in uncertain environments.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate PlanU’s effectiveness in LLM-based decision-making under uncertainty, showing improved planning performance and robustness to environmental stochasticity.

Conclusion: PlanU advances LLM-based decision-making by integrating distributional planning with explicit uncertainty quantification, offering improved decision-making under uncertainty and suggesting avenues for broader applications and future refinements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive

*Shaobo Wang,Yongliang Miao,Yuancheng Liu,and Qianli Ma,Ning Liao,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuitSeer identifies core reasoning circuits in LLMs (sparse attention heads) and selects data by their influence on these circuits; achieves data-efficient gains, e.g., 10% data yields 1.4-point Pass@1 on Qwen2.5-Math-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data and compute costs for training LLMs by leveraging internal model mechanisms instead of external heuristics or extra models.

Method: 1) Identify sparse, specialized attention heads that form core reasoning circuits during complex tasks. 2) Quantify each data point's influence on these circuits. 3) Select data with high influence for training/fine-tuning. 4) Validate across multiple models/datasets; demonstrate efficiency gains.

Result: Outperforms existing data selection baselines across 4 models and 9 datasets. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on 10% of CircuitSeer-selected data yields +1.4 Pass@1 over full-data training.

Conclusion: CircuitSeer demonstrates effective, model-internal data selection for reasoning tasks, enabling data-efficient training and broad applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

*Feifan Xia,Yuyang Fang,Defang Li,Yantong Xie,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A probabilistic intent model for LLM agents in multi-turn dialogue maintains a belief distribution over partner latent intents, updated via likelihoods after each utterance to guide policy; shows improvements on SOTOPIA benchmarks versus a baseline and an oracle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable adaptive, socially aware dialogue under uncertainty by grounding the agent policy in evolving estimates of the partner's latent intentions.

Method: Maintain a belief distribution over partner intents initialized from contextual priors; update this distribution using likelihood estimates after each utterance; use the evolving distribution to ground and adapt the dialogue policy; evaluate in the SOTOPIA environment against the Qwen2.5-7B baseline and an oracle agent that observes partner intentions.

Result: 9.0% improvement on SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard over the baseline; performance slightly surpasses an oracle that directly observes partner intentions; preliminary results.

Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling of partner intents can contribute to creating socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

### [254] [LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18477)
*Haichao Ji,Zibo Wang,Yifei Zhu,Meng han,Dan Wang,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA enables privacy-preserving analytics by integrating LLM-agent frameworks with federated analytics, using hierarchical planning and DAG-based FA operations to process natural-language queries, with optimization to reduce overhead; improves plan success and reduces costly FA work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and lack of natural-language support in federated analytics (FA). Existing LLM analytics assume centralized data; FA enables distributed privacy-preserving computation but lacks NL input and requires structured queries.

Method: LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture: a coarse-grained planner decomposes complex NL queries into sub-queries, a fine-grained planner maps each sub-query into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of FA operations using prior structural knowledge, and an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs to remove redundancies and minimize computation and communication overhead.

Result: Empirical evaluations show LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies, achieving higher execution plan success rates and a substantial reduction in resource-intensive FA operations.

Conclusion: LAFA establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, NL-driven analytics in federated settings and is the first system to integrate LLM-agent analytics with FA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

### [255] [StarBench: A Turn-Based RPG Benchmark for Agentic Multimodal Decision-Making and Information Seeking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18483)
*Haoran Zhang,Chenhao Zhu,Sicong Guo,Hanzhe Guo,Haiming Li,Donglin Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StarBench is a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on real-client-like tasks requiring end-to-end grounding from pixels to low-level actions and agentic information seeking; initial baselines reveal gaps in direct control, but purposeful information seeking correlates with better performance, making StarBench a reproducible yardstick for this problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push vision-language models toward human-like decision-making in interactive, real-client environments by testing end-to-end perception-to-action grounding and the propensity to seek guidance when stuck.

Method: Introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark derived from Honkai: Star Rail, evaluating multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and information seeking across eight combat tasks and two regimes (direct control without hints and tool-assisted control with detectors and OCR-provided observations). An ask-or-act diagnostic measures when agents request guidance and its impact on performance.

Result: Baseline results show sizable gaps in perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime. Judicious information seeking correlates with improved success. The benchmark includes reference baselines for contemporary VLMs and a human reference.

Conclusion: StarBench provides a reproducible yardstick for evaluating agentic information seeking and multimodal decision-making in real-client play and should drive progress toward more human-like, grounded AI agents.

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

### [256] [AndroidControl-Curated: Revealing the True Potential of GUI Agents through Benchmark Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18488)
*Ho Fai Leung,Xiaoyan Xi,Fei Zuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reframes GUI-based on-device assistants by refining the evaluation benchmark (AndroidControl-Curated) and introducing a compact model (Magma-R1-3B) that matches larger models on improved tasks, suggesting real-world GUI agents are closer to deployment than earlier scores implied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between reported model performance and real-world viability caused by flawed benchmarks that underestimate capabilities due to ambiguities and errors in AndroidControl.

Method: Purification pipeline to create AndroidControl-Curated; training a 3B parameter model (Magma-R1-3B) with 2.4k curated samples over 60 GPU-hours on H20, and evaluating on the curated benchmark.

Result: On AndroidControl-Curated, state-of-the-art models reach ~75% success on complex tasks (≈15% improvement over prior scores). Magma-R1-3B, though ~200x smaller, achieves comparable performance to Qwen3-VL-235B.

Conclusion: A curated benchmark reveals GUI agents are nearer to practical deployment; the proposed compact model demonstrates efficient, competitive performance; releasing both benchmark and model aims to accelerate robust, on-device virtual assistant development.

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

*Lianchen Jia,Chaoyang Li,Qian Houde,Tianchi Huang,Jiangchuan Liu,Lifeng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Crucible is an LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation that quantifies the tuning potential of control algorithms using a formal metric, validated across classic control tasks, complex systems, and a real deployment; code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tuning and configuration of control algorithms in production is under-explored, with focus on default or ideal performance. A quantitative measure of tunable space (Tuning Potential) is needed to guide design and deployment.

Method: Introduce Crucible, an agent leveraging LLM-driven, multi-level expert simulation to explore and quantify the tunable space of algorithms. Define a formal metric for Tuning Potential. Validate across diverse case studies from classical control tasks to complex computer systems and corroborate with real-world deployment.

Result: Crucible systematically quantifies tunable space across different algorithms, reveals a new dimension for analysis and design, and correlates tunability with performance improvements; supports broad applicability. Code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Crucible adds a new dimension to algorithm analysis by quantifying tunability, guiding design decisions and deployment strategies, and enabling reproducible evaluation of tuning potential across domains.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal
or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is
available at https://github.com/thu-media/Crucible.

### [258] [Counterfactual Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Value Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18526)
*Hanze Guo,Jing Yao,Xiao Zhou,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COUPLE uses a structural causal model and counterfactual reasoning to align LLM outputs with pluralistic value dimensions, addressing value complexity and steerability; shows improved alignment over baselines on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align LLMs with diverse, pluralistic human values across cultures, overcoming the limitations of methods that treat multiple values as independent and equally important.

Method: Introduce a structural causal model that captures interdependencies among value features and the mapping from high-level value dimensions to behaviors; apply counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with specified value objectives; enhances interpretability through explicit causal structure.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two datasets with different value systems shows COUPLE outperforms baseline methods across diverse value objectives.

Conclusion: Explicit causal modeling and counterfactual reasoning enable better handling of value complexity and steerability in pluralistic value alignment, with improved interpretability.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

### [259] [Physics-guided Emulators Reveal Resilience and Fragility under Operational Latencies and Outages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18535)
*Sarth Dubey,Subimal Ghosh,Udit Bhatia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An emulator for the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that remains physically coherent and robust when inputs are delayed or missing, using memory-augmented neural networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint across diverse basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operational flood forecasting requires resilience to imperfect data; advances have emphasized accuracy under ideal data rather than robustness to data gaps.

Method: Develop an emulator that couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance constraint to preserve physical coherence; define five architectures spanning varying information availability; train on minimally managed catchments in the United States and test across 5,000+ basins including heavily regulated rivers in India to evaluate robustness and generalization under data scarcity and human influence.

Result: The emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades smoothly as information quality declines; transfer across contrasting hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent performance; the framework quantifies operational robustness as a measurable property of hydrological ML and defines the limits of generalization under data scarcity and human influence.

Conclusion: Operational robustness can be quantified and improved in hydrological ML, advancing the design of reliable real-time flood forecasting systems.

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

*Yuncheng Hua,Sion Weatherhead,Mehdi Jafari,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCIA-Nabla is an end-to-end, agentic framework for simulator construction that optimizes code within a textual computation graph via a loss-driven loop and Textual-Gradient Descent, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on three CPS tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brittle prompt pipelines and ad hoc simulator generation hinder reproducibility and effectiveness; there is a need for unified, trainable, constraint-aware simulator code generation with human-in-the-loop to minimize expert effort.

Method: Construct a textual computation graph in which specialized LLM-driven agents are nodes; a workflow manager runs a loss-driven loop: code synthesis -> execution -> evaluation -> code repair; an optimizer performs Textual-Gradient Descent (TGD); human-in-the-loop confirms task requirements; the code remains the trainable object; system scales across CPS tasks and domains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy across three CPS tasks: User Modeling, Mask Adoption, and Personal Mobility.

Conclusion: Unifies multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view to convert brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible, constraint-aware simulator code generation; scalable across domains and granularities; work is under review with code release planned.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shows that significant alignment training data can be extracted from a post-trained model using embedding-based similarity, revealing data leakage risks that affect distillation and downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether data leakage from post-training (including SFT and RL) can be effectively measured with semantic embeddings, not just string matching, and to understand implications for safety, alignment, and distillation.

Method: Use a high-quality embedding model to measure semantic similarity and identify leakage, compare against edit-distance metrics, demonstrate that embedding-based extraction uncovers more data (by a large margin), extract regurgitated data from post-training phases, and test its utility by retraining a base model.

Result: Embedding-based methods reveal substantially more leaked data than edit-distance (conservative estimate: ~10x under string matching). Models readily regurgitate data from SFT/RL; using this data to retrain a base model recovers meaningful original performance. Distillation can thus act as indirect training on the model’s original dataset.

Conclusion: Embedding-based memorization leakage is a real risk in alignment pipelines; distillation may propagate the model’s original data; the work calls for attention to data leakage, the evaluation of leakage metrics, and potential mitigation strategies in alignment and distillation practices.

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating quantitative trading in dynamic markets while meeting personalized investment needs is hard; existing methods struggle to explore the wide strategy space and maintain diversity across market regimes.

Method: Use quality-diversity optimization with a feature map aligned to investor preferences (strategy type, risk, turnover, return characteristics) to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. Integrate a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to iteratively generate and evaluate strategies, enabling systematic exploration of the strategy space. Release a dataset of evolved strategies.

Result: Empirical results show QuantEvolve outperforms conventional baselines and produces a diverse, sophisticated set of strategies that adapt to market regime shifts and individual requirements; a dataset of evolved strategies is released to support future research.

Conclusion: The framework validates the effectiveness of combining quality-diversity search with hypothesis-driven multi-agent exploration for dynamic, personalized trading strategy development, and provides resources to enable further research.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a

### [263] [VAR: Visual Attention Reasoning via Structured Search and Backtracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18619)
*Wei Cai,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Ming Zhu,Haichuan Tang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAR proposes a visual-grounded reasoning framework that reframes reasoning as a structured search over a trajectory space, with two stages (traceable evidence grounding and search-based CoT) and a backtracking mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art on hallucination and safety benchmarks with a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high hallucination in multimodal LLMs and reliance on brittle linear reasoning by grounding reasoning in visual evidence and employing search with verification.

Method: VAR framework consisting of two stages: 1) traceable evidence grounding aligning textual outputs with visual input; 2) search-based chain-of-thought generation with backtracking and a multi-faceted reward function including semantic and geometric self-verification; theoretical analysis; 7B VAR-7B model.

Result: 7B VAR-7B achieves new state-of-the-art on hallucination and safety benchmarks; outperforms open-source models and rivals leading proprietary systems.

Conclusion: Recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search with backtracking, improves reliability and grounding in MLLMs, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

TL;DR: A data+knowledge integration approach: using data-mined association rules to boost decision tree/ random forest performance and generate abductive explanations; improves predictive accuracy and explanation size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to improve predictive performance and human-understandable explanations by combining data-driven rules with tree-based classifiers.

Method: Mine association rules (possibly with negations) from data; integrate these rules to enhance tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) for prediction; use the rules to produce abductive explanations that are more general.

Result: For the two tree-based models studied, the approach yields improved predictive performance and shorter explanation sizes.

Conclusion: Incorporating mined association rules as knowledge into tree-based models can enhance both accuracy and the conciseness/quality of explanations.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

### [265] [Comparative Expressivity for Structured Argumentation Frameworks with Uncertain Rules and Premises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18631)
*Carlo Proietti,Antonio Yuste-Ginel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes grounding qualitative uncertainty in structured argument components to study how abstract uncertainty models can be instantiated; introduces an expressivity notion and presents both positive and negative expressivity comparisons between abstract and structured formalisms (relating to incomplete AFs and ASPIC+).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand how abstract uncertainty models can be instantiated in practice, bridging qualitative uncertainty modelling with concrete components (rules and premises) to improve practical and theoretical understanding in argumentation.

Method: Define expressivity that covers abstract and structured formalisms; instantiate abstract models with structured building blocks; compare expressivity by proving positive and negative results; discuss frameworks (incomplete abstract AFs with dependencies, and ASPIC+).

Result: Established a notion of expressivity applicable to both abstract and structured uncertainty models; derived both positive and negative expressivity results, clarifying when structured models can simulate or fail to capture abstract ones; affects both abstract frameworks and ASPIC+.

Conclusion: Bridging abstract uncertainty models with their plausible structured instantiations clarifies limits and capabilities of expressivity, guiding future modelling choices for uncertain argumentation frameworks.

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

### [266] [Query Decomposition for RAG: Balancing Exploration-Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18633)
*Roxana Petcu,Kenton Murray,Daniel Khashabi,Evangelos Kanoulas,Maarten de Rijke,Dawn Lawrie,Kevin Duh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bandit-based, query-decomposition approach for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that dynamically selects informative sub-queries and documents; rank-informed relevance estimates with human judgments yield substantial gains in retrieval quality and long-form generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off in RAG between retrieving enough relevant material and limiting noise/cost, by framing query decomposition and document retrieval as an exploitation-exploration problem and using sequential decision making to select informative sub-queries.

Method: Formulate retrieval as a sequential bandit decision process where documents are retrieved one at a time to build a belief about sub-query utility. Evaluate multiple bandit learning methods and leverage rank information and human judgments to estimate document relevance, guiding exploitation vs. exploration in selecting sub-queries.

Result: Using rank-based relevance estimates and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, a 15% improvement in alpha-nDCG, and improved performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.

Conclusion: A bandit-driven, rank-informed relevance estimation approach effectively balances retrieval breadth and precision in RAG, enabling dynamic sub-query selection and improved downstream outcomes.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

### [267] [Sherlock Your Queries: Learning to Ask the Right Questions for Dialogue-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18659)
*Dong Yun,Marco Schouten,Dim Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SherlockLLM is an RL-driven, dialogue-based retrieval agent that asks binary yes/no questions to efficiently shrink the search space, achieving near-optimal performance on structured tasks and strong improvements on unstructured tasks without relying on annotated dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it hard to identify the target from a single query. Existing dialogue-based retrieval methods lack a principled, data-efficient strategy for asking informative questions; there is a need for an explicit, learnable questioning strategy that does not require large annotated dialogue data.

Method: Train an agent via reinforcement learning to generate a sequence of binary questions that progressively narrow the search space. Build a benchmark with structured and unstructured tasks to evaluate the querying policy, without relying on large-scale annotated dialogue data.

Result: Structured tasks: performance matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimum defined by binary search. Unstructured task: the agent significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy.

Conclusion: SherlockLLM is robust and efficient, capable of learning an effective information-seeking dialogue policy without annotated data, and generalizes across task types (structured and unstructured).

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

*Patterson Hsieh,Jerry Yeh,Mao-Chi He,Wen-Han Hsieh,Elvis Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALGOS is a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that uses remote sensing, GeoSAM-assisted mask curation, and CAML-based severity prediction to achieve robust segmentation and severity estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is intensifying harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as cyanobacteria, threatening ecosystems and human health; traditional manual sampling is labor-intensive and offers limited spatial/temporal coverage; scalable AI-driven monitoring is needed.

Method: ALGOS combines segmentation and severity reasoning for HAB monitoring using remote sensing imagery. It uses GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation to curate high-quality segmentation masks and fine-tunes a vision-language model on severity prediction using Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) from NASA.

Result: Experiments show robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation, indicating practical potential for automated cyanobacterial monitoring.

Conclusion: ALGOS advances automated HAB monitoring by delivering reliable segmentation and severity estimation, moving toward scalable, practical cyanobacterial surveillance.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

*Shirin Tavakoli Kafiabad,Andrea Schiffauerova,Ashkan Ebadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BERTopic with COFFEE shows finer-grained, coherent themes and reveals regional and gendered patterns in 18 years of NSERC proposals, offering actionable insights for equitable funding strategies; LDA and STM are solid baselines but less granular.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand evolving research trends and demographics in federally funded science to guide equitable, impactful funding decisions.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three topic models (LDA, STM, BERTopic) on 2005–2022 NSERC research proposals; development of COFFEE, a covariate analysis extension for BERTopic to estimate covariate effects (e.g., province, gender).

Result: BERTopic yielded more granular and coherent emergent themes (e.g., rapid AI expansion) than LDA/STM; COFFEE enables covariate effect estimation showing provincial specializations and gender-based patterns across disciplines.

Conclusion: BERTopic, augmented with COFFEE, provides a robust empirical basis for designing equitable funding policies by revealing fine-grained topics and covariate associations; the approach supports more targeted, diverse, and impactful science investment.

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

### [270] [Bounding the number of holes required for folding rectangular polyomoinoes into cubes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18197)
*Florian Lehner,Benjamin Shirley*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Uniform-hole configurations: minimal cube-foldable hole sets have size at most 4; mixed-hole types: no finite upper bound on minimal set size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how introducing holes in rectangular polyominoes enables folding into a cube under grid crease constraints, and to determine how hole combinatorics affect cube-foldability.

Method: Theoretical combinatorial analysis separating two cases: (i) all holes of the same type and (ii) holes of different types. Derives bounds by constructing minimal configurations and using arguments about cube folding with grid creases.

Result: When all holes are of the same type, any minimal hole set that guarantees cube-foldability has size at most 4. Allowing different hole types removes the finite bound, so there is no universal upper bound on the size of a minimal cube-foldable-hole set.

Conclusion: Uniform-hole-type constraints yield a finite, tight bound on necessary holes for cube-foldability; heterogeneous hole types demonstrate that complexity increases dramatically, eliminating a universal cap on minimal hole-set size and suggesting richer combinatorial structure for folding with holes.

Abstract: We study the problem of whether rectangular polyominoes with holes are
cube-foldable, that is, whether they can be folded into a cube, if creases are
only allowed along grid lines. It is known that holes of sufficient size
guarantee that this is the case.
  Smaller holes which by themselves do not make a rectangular polyomino
cube-foldable can sometimes be combined to create cube-foldable polyominoes. We
investigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show
that if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at
most 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound
on the size.

### [271] [On the Computation of Schrijver's Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18597)
*Vincent Delecroix,Oscar Fontaine,Francis Lazarus*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Proposes a polynomial-time construction of a minor kernel for a graph G on a genus-g surface and uses it to enable fast computation of intersection numbers μ_G(c) and to compare μ across graph minors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how graphs embedded on surfaces intersect closed curves, and enable efficient queries of the intersection-minimization map μ_G, including comparisons of μ across graph minors.

Method: Compute a minor kernel in O(n^3 log n) time using a tight bound on the size of minimal bigons; develop subroutines for area computation and lift-simplicity testing in the universal cover; leverage a recent result to compute μ_G(c) after preprocessing; compare with alternative approaches that avoid kernels.

Result: Algorithm yields a minor kernel in O(n^3 log n) time with O(n) space; after preprocessing, compute μ_G(c) in O(g(n+ℓ) log(n+ℓ)) for a closed walk c of length ℓ; the state-of-the-art approach can compute μ_G(c) in O(g n ℓ log(nℓ)) with different preprocessing; also enables polynomial-time decision of whether μ_H = μ_{H'} for minors H, H' of G.

Conclusion: Minor-kernel techniques offer a powerful route for efficient analysis of surface-embedded graphs, enabling fast evaluation of intersection-minimizing properties and polynomial-time comparisons of μ across minors, with implications for multicurve optimization on surfaces.

Abstract: The geometry of a graph $G$ embedded on a closed oriented surface $S$ can be
probed by counting the intersections of $G$ with closed curves on $S$. Of
special interest is the map $c \mapsto \mu_G(c)$ counting the minimum number of
intersections between $G$ and any curve freely homotopic to a given curve $c$.
Schrijver [On the uniqueness of kernels, 1992] calls $G$ a kernel if for any
proper graph minor $H$ of $G$ we have $\mu_H < \mu_G$. Hence, $G$ admits a
minor $H$ which is a kernel and such that $\mu_G = \mu_H$. We show how to
compute such a minor kernel of $G$ in $O(n^3 \log n)$ time where $n$ is the
number of edges of $G$, and $g\ge 2$ is the genus of $S$. Our algorithm
leverages a tight bound on the size of minimal bigons in a system of closed
curves. It also relies on several subroutines of independent interest including
the computation of the area enclosed by a curve and a test of simplicity for
the lift of a curve in the universal covering of $S$.
  As a consequence of our minor kernel algorithm and a recent result of Dubois
[Making multicurves cross minimally on surfaces, 2024], after a preprocessing
that takes $O(n^3 \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, we are able to compute
$\mu_G(c)$ in $O(g (n + \ell) \log(n + \ell))$ time given any closed walk $c$
with $\ell$ edges. The state-of-the-art algorithm by Colin de Verdi\`ere and
Erickson [Tightening non-simple paths and cycles on surfaces, 2010] would avoid
constructing a kernel but would lead to a computation of $\mu_G(c)$ in $O(g n
\ell \log(n \ell))$ time (with a preprocessing that takes $O(gn\log n)$ time
and $O(gn)$ space). Another consequence of the computation of minor kernels is
the ability to decide in polynomial time whether two graph minors $H$ and $H'$
of $G$ satisfy $\mu_H = \mu_{H'}$.
