### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-adapted LLM encoders enable robust radiology image-text alignment by handling report heterogeneity; improves clinical text understanding and cross-dataset generalization, beyond scaling noisy data; models are released for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports are highly heterogeneous and noisy (abbreviations, impression-only notes, stylistic variability). In medical domains, simply scaling data can plateau or degrade learning. Robust LLM-based representations that transfer across styles are needed to guide image-text alignment.

Method: Introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports. Combine it in a dual-tower framework LLM2CLIP4CXR with a vision backbone for image-text alignment. Train on 1.6M CXR studies from public/private sources with heterogeneous reports. Evaluate on report-level alignment, retrieval accuracy, clinically oriented scores, and cross-dataset generalization, comparing against BERT baselines and prior medical CLIP variants.

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines and handles abbreviations and style variation, achieving strong report-level clinical alignment. LLM2CLIP4CXR uses these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants.

Conclusion: Robustness of medical multimodal representations, not merely data scale, drives effective image-text learning in radiology. The authors release the models to advance research in medical image-text representation learning.

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec introduces Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding for VLMs, achieving first substantial speedups by compressing image information with a vision adaptor, augmenting text with global image features, and training on extended multimodal outputs to prevent shortcut learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding yields modest speedups (<1.5x) for vision-language models, unlike large language models. There is a need to accelerate VLM inference without sacrificing multimodal understanding as models scale.

Method: Introduce a lightweight vision adaptor to compress image tokens and integrate them into the draft model's attention while preserving image positional information. Extract a global image feature and augment subsequent text tokens. Create an extended multimodal training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating longer outputs with the target VLM, with a training strategy to avoid shortcut learning from direct hidden-state access.

Result: ViSpec achieves the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ViSpec demonstrates that vision-aware speculative decoding can significantly speed up VLM inference while maintaining multimodal coherence, suggesting a promising direction for scalable multimodal models and future improvements.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE is a multimodal compliance engine that uses a mother–child MLLM architecture to evaluate 15+ ad-compliance attributes in a single pass, reducing human review and dramatically cutting inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional compliance pipelines are fragmented, costly, and hard to adapt to dynamic guidelines. A unified, vision-language framework leveraging Multimodal LLMs can streamline assessment of brand, legal, and platform-specific standards across content. 

Method: Introduce Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE). Apply a mother–child MLLM setup where a stronger parent MLLM evaluates outputs from smaller child models to perform end-to-end compliance assessment over vision-language inputs. Develop a human-annotated benchmark with augmented samples (visual obstructions, profanity injection) for structured evaluation. Demonstrate on advertisement compliance and report costs and accuracy.

Result: M-PACE achieves automated quality control with significantly reduced inference costs (over 31x lower). The fastest selected child–parent pairing (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child, Gemini 2.5 Pro as reference) runs at about 0.0005 per image with comparable accuracy to the higher-cost model at 0.0159 per image, enabling real-time deployment with reduced human reviewer reliance.

Conclusion: A unified, cost-efficient framework can replace multi-stage pipelines for multimodal compliance, offering scalable, real-time evaluation across diverse guidelines, with M-PACE showing strong performance in advertisement compliance and potential applicability to other domains.

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid AI-AFM framework ProFusion uses a virtual AFM to train diffusion and NeRF models for 3D protein complex reconstruction from AFM height maps, enabling scalable, cost-effective structure prediction with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large protein complexes lack 3D cues; AI-based predictions struggle; AFM provides 2D height maps but data is scarce; need scalable synthetic data and integration with ML for accurate 3D reconstructions.

Method: Build virtual AFM pipeline to generate 542k multi-view proteins; train conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs; apply instance-specific NeRF to reconstruct 3D structures; validate against experimental AFM images; measure Chamfer Distance within AFM resolution.

Result: Achieves average Chamfer Distance within AFM resolution; high fidelity reconstructions; validated on various protein complexes; demonstrates potential for cost-effective, rapid structural predictions with AFM-based validation.

Conclusion: ProFusion provides a scalable hybrid approach that combines DL with AFM to reconstruct protein complex structures, reducing experimental cost and enabling rapid iterative validation; suitable for future adoption in structural biology.

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEL is a framework to improve interpretability of vision-language models by integrating a Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module with gradient-based explanations, enabling multi-scale feature processing, adaptive attention, and cross-modal alignment to produce more focused, context-aware attributions while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical vision-language tasks require transparent and reliable model decisions. Existing gradient-based explanations for transformers struggle with complex object relationships and cross-modal cues, necessitating methods that capture multi-scale relationships and provide trustworthy visualizations.

Method: Propose MMEL, building on Grad-eclip, via a Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that processes multi-scale features, applies layer-specific adaptive weights, and aligns cross-modal representations. Semantic relationships are incorporated into gradient-based attribution maps to generate richer visual explanations that reflect scene structure.

Result: Experiments on standard datasets show MMEL yields more focused and contextually aware explanations that better reflect how vision-language models process complex scenes, while maintaining high performance across domains.

Conclusion: MMEL enhances interpretability of vision-language models without sacrificing accuracy and offers a generalizable framework for reliable, semantically informed explanations in diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), a navigation-specific token pruning method for Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) that pre-filters tokens into foreground/background and prunes background tokens, aided by LLM-derived instructions, to achieve significant FLOPS savings with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLN models are powerful but resource-intensive; naive token pruning can degrade navigation by reducing informative cues and potentially increasing walk length. There is a need for pruning methods that respect navigation dynamics and task structure.

Method: NAP pre-filters tokens into foreground/background using navigation cues (e.g., image views are kept if they offer navigable directions). It uses a Large Language Model to extract navigation-relevant instructions. Pruning concentrates on background tokens to minimize information loss and removes low-importance navigation nodes to discourage backtracking.

Result: NAP outperforms prior pruning methods on standard VLN benchmarks, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

Conclusion: Task-specific pruning strategies that leverage navigation traits can drastically improve VLN efficiency with limited accuracy loss, suggesting broader applicability to other navigation-oriented tasks.

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff uses a dual-module transformation on diffusion bottlenecks to enforce responsible concepts while preserving semantic alignment, achieving improved responsible generation by ~20% without sacrificing image quality and scaling to SDXL; introduces a score-matching objective to coordinate modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness and safety in text-to-image diffusion often degrade semantic fidelity or image quality; there is a need to enforce responsible generation without hurting content accuracy or visuals.

Method: Apply two learnable modules to intermediate bottleneck representations: one captures/enforces responsible concepts (fairness/safety) and the other maintains semantic alignment with neutral prompts; introduce a novel score-matching objective to coordinate learning between modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation, maintains semantic alignment, and preserves image fidelity; ~20% improvement on responsible and semantically coherent generation across diverse unseen prompts; compatible with large models like SDXL; code will be released.

Conclusion: RespoDiff provides a practical dual-learning framework for responsible text-to-image generation, achieving better safety/ fairness while maintaining semantic fidelity and image quality, and integrates smoothly with existing diffusion backbones.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity in diffusion-model training. Early AJEST data selection can match or slightly exceed autoguidance in data efficiency on 2-D and 3x64x64 tasks, but its overhead and complexity make autoguidance or random selection preferable overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the compute costs of training generative diffusion models by leveraging data curation via online selection and autoguidance, and to benchmark these methods in a unified framework.

Method: Integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a common codebase for fast ablations; compare combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic task and a 3×64×64 image task; evaluate at equal wall-clock time and equal sample counts, accounting for selection overhead; analyze early AJEST vs autoguidance vs uniform sampling.

Result: Across experiments, autoguidance improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST can match or modestly exceed autoguidance in data efficiency on both tasks, but its overhead and added complexity generally favor autoguidance or uniform random selection in most scenarios.

Conclusion: Targeted online data selection can yield early training efficiency gains, but robust, higher-quality samples are primarily driven by autoguidance. The authors discuss limitations, scope, and when data selection may still be beneficial.

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [9] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM fingerprinting via phase-enhanced radial DFT for AI-generated image attribution; high accuracy across datasets and real-vs-fake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of generative AI, there is a critical need for reliable attribution methods to identify the source models of AI-generated content, especially in commercial and multimodal contexts where model internals may be inaccessible.

Method: PRISM uses a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform to form frequency-domain signatures from amplitude and phase information. These signatures are then classified with linear discriminant analysis for model attribution. The study introduces PRISM-36K (36,000 images from six models) and evaluates on four external benchmarks, plus a real-vs-fake detection task.

Result: On PRISM-36K, attribution accuracy is 92.04%. Across four benchmarks, average attribution accuracy is 81.60%. Real-vs-fake detection averages 88.41%, with GenImage achieving 95.06% (vs 82.20% baseline).

Conclusion: Frequency-domain fingerprinting via phase-enhanced radial DFT is effective for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, supporting accountability in generative AI systems; the approach generalizes beyond training models and offers practical utility for trust and verification in paid generative services.

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) show better geometric structure understanding in mental-rotation tasks than supervised ones; intermediate layers outperform final layers, and task difficulty grows with rotation/occlusion, mirroring human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether modern vision transformers acquire human-like mental rotation abilities and how training regime and representation depth affect such spatial reasoning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across mental-rotation tasks from simple Shepard-Metzler-style blocks to complex block figures, three text types, and photo-realistic objects; layer-wise probing to identify where representations encode geometry.

Result: (i) Self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; (ii) intermediate layers outperform final layers; (iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, aligning with human reaction-time patterns and suggesting similar constraints in embedding spaces.

Conclusion: Self-supervised training enhances geometric understanding in ViTs; layer-wise effects reveal where spatial reasoning emerges, and the observed human-like difficulty patterns imply embedding-space constraints that shape spatial cognition in these models.

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

### [11] [Which Direction to Choose? An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272)
*Yannis Kaltampanidis,Alexandros Doumanoglou,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematically evaluates unmodified ViT features (tokens and intermediate representations) for image classification and segmentation, using simple decision rules (hyperplane or cosine similarity) without extra transformations, across SSL pretraining objectives and few-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use of SSL with ViTs and added transformation heads, the intrinsic representational quality of raw ViT features remains underexplored. Understanding which unaltered features and decision rules are most predictive can guide efficient downstream usage and benchmark intrinsic capacity.

Method: Empirical analysis across token types (e.g., tokens, keys, queries, values, final FFN outputs), tasks (classification and segmentation), and contexts (standard and few-shot) using ViT models pretrained via Contrastive Learning or Masked Image Modeling. No additional feature transformations or heads are applied; classification/segmentation use hyperplane-based or cosine-similarity-based rules.

Result: The study provides insights into which token types and decision rules yield the best performance for each task and context, highlighting that optimal choices depend on pretraining objective and downstream scenario. Detailed findings are reported on two widely-used datasets, establishing baseline expectations for unmodified ViT features.

Conclusion: Unaltered ViT features carry significant intrinsic information valuable for downstream tasks. The results offer practical guidelines on selecting token type and simple decision rules without extra transformations and contribute to a deeper understanding of ViT representations under SSL pretraining.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

### [12] [How Good are Foundation Models in Step-by-Step Embodied Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15293)
*Dinura Dissanayake,Ahmed Heakl,Omkar Thawakar,Noor Ahsan,Ritesh Thawkar,Ketan More,Jean Lahoud,Rao Anwer,Hisham Cholakkal,Ivan Laptev,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoMER is a benchmark to evaluate foundation models' ability to perform step-by-step embodied reasoning in real-world tasks. It introduces a large, multi-task, multi-embodiment dataset, a framework separating perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and empirical analysis of leading LMMs, with public data/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how foundation models (large multimodal models) can perform structured, step-by-step decision making in embodied environments, bridging perception, safety, and action planning for real-world robots.

Method: Propose FoMER benchmark consisting of a large-scale curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks that require multimodal observation, physical constraint/safety reasoning, and natural-language action generation. Includes an evaluation framework that disentangles perception grounding from action reasoning, and an empirical analysis of several leading LMMs across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments (3 robot types), with detailed step-by-step reasoning.

Result: The benchmark contains over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments. Results show both potential and current limitations of LMMs in embodied reasoning, highlighting core challenges and opportunities for future research in robot intelligence; plan for public release of data and code.

Conclusion: FoMER provides a rigorous, scalable testbed for embodied reasoning in LMMs, demonstrating progress and gaps in current capabilities. It encourages improvements in grounding, safety-aware reasoning, and context-aware action generation, with anticipated future work and community involvement through public data/code.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

### [13] [CoDoL: Conditional Domain Prompt Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15330)
*Min Zhang,Bo Jiang,Jie Zhou,Yimeng Liu,Xin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDoL introduces conditional domain prompts and a Domain Meta Network to improve CLIP-style VLMs' text-image alignment and OOD generalization by leveraging domain information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based CLIP suffers from inaccurate text descriptions and weak vision-language embedding alignment, which degrade accuracy, robustness, and zero-shot performance, especially for OOD data.

Method: Develop Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) that uses domain information to form prompts, and a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional tokens per domain, capturing both instance-specific and domain-specific information to enhance domain alignment.

Result: Empirical validation on four OOD benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, DigitDG) demonstrates that CoDoL improves vision-language embedding alignment and out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: CoDoL effectively leverages domain information to boost prompt-based CLIP alignment and OOD generalization, offering a practical and scalable approach with potential for broader applicability and future refinements.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

*Yulin Wang,Yang Yue,Yang Yue,Huanqian Wang,Haojun Jiang,Yizeng Han,Zanlin Ni,Yifan Pu,Minglei Shi,Rui Lu,Qisen Yang,Andrew Zhao,Zhuofan Xia,Shiji Song,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN reframes vision as an active, coarse-to-fine sequential process that selectively attends to task-relevant regions, drastically reducing computation with minimal accuracy loss across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency and rigidity of passive, full-scene processing in current vision models, enabling budget-aware, interpretable, human-like perception.

Method: A coarse-to-fine sequential fixation framework that identifies and attends to informative regions, accumulates evidence over fixations, and decides when to stop; combines representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning to train end-to-end without supervision on fixation locations; handles non-differentiable components.

Result: Evaluated on 17 benchmarks across 9 tasks, AdaptiveNN yields up to 28x inference cost reduction with no accuracy sacrifice, adapts to varying budgets without retraining, and offers interpretable fixation patterns; shows human-like perceptual behavior in many cases.

Conclusion: Represents a promising direction toward efficient, adaptive, and interpretable vision systems; enables broader real-world deployment and provides a framework for studying visual cognition; code available at the provided URL.

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

### [15] [LowDiff: Efficient Diffusion Sampling with Low-Resolution Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15342)
*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff proposes a cascaded diffusion framework that grows outputs from low to high resolution using a single unified model, delivering >50% throughput gains with comparable or better quality across CIFAR-10, FFHQ, and ImageNet in both pixel and latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome slow sampling in diffusion models by leveraging multi-resolution generation rather than only compressing models or reducing steps.

Method: Cascade-based architecture starting from low resolution, progressively refining to the target resolution with a single model that handles multiple scales; applicable to pixel and latent spaces; evaluated on conditional and unconditional tasks across multiple datasets.

Result: Over 50% throughput improvement across datasets; quality metrics: CIFAR-10 unconditional FID 2.11, IS 9.87; CIFAR-10 conditional FID 1.94, IS 10.03; FFHQ 64x64 FID 2.43; ImageNet-256 FID 4.00, IS 195.06; demonstrates generality and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: LowDiff is a general, efficient diffusion framework achieving faster sampling with maintained or improved quality, applicable across data modalities and tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

### [16] [MaskAttn-SDXL: Controllable Region-Level Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15357)
*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A region-level masking mechanism (MaskAttn-SDXL) gates SDXL cross-attention logits to sparsify token-to-latent interactions, improving compositionality in multi-object prompts with negligible overhead and without extra tokens or region masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models suffer from compositional failures (cross-token interference) when prompts include multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations, leading to entanglement and misbinding. A data-efficient, light-weight mechanism is needed to enforce spatial/compositional control.

Method: Introduce MaskAttn-SDXL, a learnable binary mask per layer applied to cross-attention logits before softmax in the Stable Diffusion XL UNet. The mask is region-level, gating connections so only semantically relevant token-to-latent interactions remain active. No positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks are required; inference path remains unchanged with negligible overhead.

Result: The approach improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: Logit-level masked cross-attention is an effective, data-efficient primitive for enforcing compositional control and offers a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

### [17] [RaceGAN: A Framework for Preserving Individuality while Converting Racial Information for Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15391)
*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN enables non-referential, multi-domain ethnic attribute translation (Asian/White/Black) in unpaired image-to-image translation, preserving identity and semantics; achieves superior results on CFD and reveals latent-space clustering by ethnicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior unpaired translation methods (CycleGAN, StarGAN, StyleGAN) which either require a reference image or fail to capture low-level style changes, by enabling multi-domain racial attribute translation without reference images and by analyzing latent space structure.

Method: Introduce RaceGAN, a framework that maps style codes across several domains during racial attribute translation in an unpaired setting, preserving individuality and high-level semantics without a reference image; evaluate using InceptionReNetv2 classifier on Chicago Face Dataset; analyze latent space clustering across ethnic groups.

Result: RaceGAN outperforms baselines in translating racial features on CFD; quantitative gains shown via InceptionReNetv2-based classification; latent space analysis indicates distinct, cluster-like organization for each ethnicity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness of non-referential, multi-domain racial attribute translation with preserved identity and semantics; reveals meaningful latent-space partitioning by ethnicity and suggests avenues for more nuanced control and fairness considerations.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

*Kunal Rathore,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to derive global, human-readable explanations by transferring user-labeled parts from a small set to a larger dataset and aggregating local explanations into global explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are opaque and existing explanations are mostly local. Global, symbolic explanations are desirable but require extensive labeling; this work seeks to reduce labeling cost while enabling scalable, global interpretability.

Method: Annotate a limited set of images with user-defined part labels, transfer these labels to a larger dataset, generate local part-based explanations per image, and aggregate them to form global, symbolic explanations that explain model decisions at scale.

Result: Not specified in the abstract; the abstract suggests efficient transfer and global explanation generation but reports no empirical results.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable, human-understandable explanations by combining local part-based explanations into global symbolic explanations via transferred part labels, reducing labeling cost.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

### [19] [Causal Fingerprints of AI Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15406)
*Hui Xu,Chi Liu,Congcong Zhu,Minghao Wang,Youyang Qu,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causal fingerprinting framework for generative models disentangles provenance signals from image content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from diffusion reconstruction residuals, enabling robust cross-model attribution and anonymization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model fingerprints rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, limiting generalization across GANs and diffusion models. A causal, content- and style-invariant fingerprint reflecting image provenance is needed.

Method: Introduce a causality-decoupling framework that derives a semantic-invariant latent space from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residuals to separate causality (image provenance) from content/style. Enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations and validate via attribution across GANs and diffusion models; perform source anonymization using counterfactuals generated from causal fingerprints.

Result: Outperforms existing attribution methods across representative GANs and diffusion models; demonstrates effective source anonymization using counterfactuals based on causal fingerprints; shows strong potential for forgery detection, copyright tracing, and identity protection.

Conclusion: Causality-based fingerprints provide robust, generalizable model attribution and protection against forgery, outperforming prior model-specific approaches and enabling practical applications in authenticity verification and rights protection.

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

*Moinak Bhattacharya,Angelica P. Kurtz,Fabio M. Iwamoto,Prateek Prasanna,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neuro-oncology foundation model with distributionally robust optimization improves cross-site generalization and prediction for common/uncommon molecular markers and survival, with interpretable localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous multi-institution data and underrepresentation of rare molecular markers hinder foundation model generalization; robust handling of site- and class-imbalance is needed for accurate neuro-oncology phenotyping.

Method: Pretrain self-supervised backbones (BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institution brain MRI; apply distributionally robust optimization (DRO) during training; downstream tasks include classification of MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR; uncommon alterations ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT; continuous markers Ki-67, TP53; survival in IDH-wild-type glioblastoma; evaluate across UCSF, UPenn, CUIMC; Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: CUIMC: mean balanced accuracy 0.744→0.785; AUC 0.656→0.676; notable gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B acc 0.86→0.92; AUC 0.73→0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69→0.82; Ki-67 acc 0.60→0.69). Survival c-index improved at all sites (CUIMC 0.592→0.597; UPenn 0.647→0.672; UCSF 0.600→0.627). Grad-CAM highlights tumor and peri-tumoral regions; reduced site-specific embedding differences.

Conclusion: Coupling foundation models with DRO yields more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon markers, and enhances survival discrimination; underscores need for prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

*Chung-En Johnny Yu,Hsuan-Chih,Chen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORCA is a test-time, evidence-based reasoning framework that pairs LVLMs with small vision tools to reduce hallucinations and improve adversarial robustness through an Observe-Reason-Critique-Act loop, without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer intrinsic hallucinations and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations; improving reliability requires external, auditable reasoning without access to model internals or retraining.

Method: ORCA uses Observe–Reason–Critique–Act loop; queries multiple vision models (<3B params) with evidential questions; cross-model inconsistency checks; iterative refinement; stores reasoning traces; operates at test time; no retraining; can be used with defenses.

Result: On POPE hallucination benchmark, standalone LVLM performance improves by 3.64% to 40.67% across subsets; under adversarial perturbations, average accuracy gain +20.11% across LVLMs; with defense on AMBER, gains +1.20% to +48.00% across metrics.

Conclusion: ORCA demonstrates improved factual accuracy and robustness for multimodal systems, offering auditable, non-intrusive improvement without retraining, and suggests a promising direction for reliable LVLMs; emergent adversarial robustness observed.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

*Abolfazl Saheban Maleki,Maryam Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv) introduces per-kernel-element boundary offsets to form flexible rectangular sampling regions, decoupling receptive field shape from kernel structure to adapt to content and capture both local and long-range information with small kernels, balancing attention-like adaptability with convolutional efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deformable convolutions use fixed sampling patterns and fixed quadrilaterals, limiting adaptation to diverse image structures. There is a need for flexible receptive fields that can adjust width and height, enabling detailed local features and long-range context without the computational cost of full attention.

Method: Proposes four boundary offsets per kernel element to define a rectangular region whose size and shape can change with the input. This decouples receptive field geometry from the kernel, enabling dynamic, content-driven receptive fields while preserving the efficiency of standard convolutions.

Result: Claims improved expressiveness and adaptability over fixed convs and standard deformable convs, with the ability to capture both local details and long-range dependencies even with 1x1 kernels; potential efficiency advantages over attention-based methods.

Conclusion: RAD-Conv provides a practical, efficient bridge between rigid convolutional architectures and attention-based models, enabling more expressive vision networks without incurring the full cost of attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAGE is a robust edge-centric framework for reconstructing vector floorplans from noisy point-cloud density maps, using a native edge representation and a dual-query transformer denoising decoder, achieving state-of-the-art metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Corner-based polygon representations are fragile under noise and incomplete observations; there is a need for a representation that yields watertight, topologically valid floorplans and robust recovery of fine geometric details.

Method: Introduce a native edge-centric formulation: model each wall as a directed, geometrically continuous edge; employ a dual-query transformer decoder with perturbed and latent queries in a denoising framework to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Structured3D and SceneCAD; F1: rooms 99.1%, corners 91.7%, angles 89.3%; demonstrates cross-dataset generalization.

Conclusion: CAGE yields coherent, watertight floorplans with improved robustness; code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled longitudinal multimodal medical data (CT + EHR) via JEPA improves internal prediction of pulmonary nodules but shows limited external generalization; a synthetic environment clarifies when JEPA may underperform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and overfitting in multimodal pulmonary nodule diagnosis; leveraging unlabeled multimodal archives can improve predictive models.

Method: Curate an unlabeled dataset of CT scans with linked electronic health records. Pretrain a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) with self-supervised objectives, followed by supervised finetuning. Evaluate on internal and external cohorts and develop a synthetic environment to understand under which contexts JEPA underperforms.

Result: Internal cohort: JEPA AUC 0.91, multimodal 0.88, imaging-only 0.73. External cohort: JEPA 0.72, imaging-only 0.75. JEPA outperforms internally but underperforms externally.

Conclusion: Unlabeled multimodal archives can enhance predictive models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis, but generalization to external cohorts is limited; a synthetic environment helps delineate the contexts of underperformance and guides future improvements.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

*Zhenghao Zhao,Haoxuan Wang,Junyi Wu,Yuzhang Shang,Gaowen Liu,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDGE is a generative multimodal dataset distillation method that uses bi-directional contrastive and diversity losses with a caption-synthesis strategy to align images with captions and diversify samples, achieving ~18x faster distillation on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multimodal foundation models (and LLMs with multimodal inputs) grow, efficient distillation of image-text datasets becomes crucial. Existing methods (notably those based on Matching Training Trajectories) are extremely computation-intensive and can take days, while generative distillation faces challenges in aligning generated images with captions and in sample diversity.

Method: Propose a generative distillation workflow featuring a bi-directional contrastive loss to tighten image-text alignment in both generation directions, plus a diversity loss to promote varied samples. Introduce a caption-synthesis strategy that injects richer textual information to improve text-to-image retrieval.

Result: Empirical results on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M show superior performance and efficiency, with EDGE achieving about 18× faster distillation than the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: EDGE delivers efficient multimodal dataset distillation by addressing image-caption correlation and sample diversity with a reduced compute footprint, enabling scalable distillation for large multimodal datasets.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

*Björn Möller,Zhengyang Li,Malte Stelzer,Thomas Graave,Fabian Bettels,Muaaz Ataya,Tim Fingscheidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenViGA is an open, modular video generation system for automotive driving scenes that uses open-source components, is fine-tuned on public data, and releases code and data for reproducibility, achieving 256×256 videos at 4 fps with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high resource requirements, lack of transparency, and unavailable code/datasets in recent driving-video generation methods; provide a modular, open, reproducible framework with thorough analysis of each component.

Method: Develop OpenViGA by integrating and separately evaluating three components—image tokenizer, world model, and video decoder—using pre-trained open-source models fine-tuned on the BDD100K automotive dataset; standardize interfaces to create a coherent, end-to-end system and publish code and models publicly.

Result: Demonstrates realistic driving videos generated frame-by-frame with 256×256 resolution at 4 fps and about one frame of algorithmic latency; provides both quantitative and qualitative analysis of each module and ensures reproducibility via open data and public code on Github.

Conclusion: OpenViGA shows that an open, modular approach to driving-video generation is feasible and reproducible, clarifying design choices and enabling broader access to research through public models, data, and code.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

### [27] [Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15482)
*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Six computational pathology foundation models (three vision-language, three vision-only) were analyzed to characterize their internal representations using representational similarity analysis on TCGA H&E patches. Key findings include model-dependent representational distinctness vs similarity, strong slide-dependence with weaker disease-dependence, stain normalization reducing slide-dependence, and vision-language models showing more compact representations. Implications touch robustness to slide variation and ensembling strategies, with a transferable framework for medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are being developed for CPath, but little is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Understanding representational geometry can inform robustness to slide-heterogeneity, ensemble design, and how training paradigms shape representations.

Method: Representational similarity analysis (RSA) on H&E patches from TCGA across six CPath foundation models (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP as vision-language; UNI v2, Virchow v2, Prov-GigaPath as vision-only/self-distillation). Investigated intrinsic dimensionality, slide- vs disease-dependence, effects of stain normalization, and cross-model representational similarity.

Result: UNI2 and Virchow2 show the most distinct representational structures; Prov-GigaPath exhibits the highest average similarity across models. Merely sharing a training paradigm (vision-only vs vision-language) does not guarantee higher similarity. All models display high slide-dependence and relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization reduces slide-dependence by 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). Vision-language models tend to have more compact representations, while vision-only models are more distributed.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how training paradigms and preprocessing steps shape representations, offering guidance for improving robustness to slide-specific features and informing ensembling strategies. The proposed RSA framework is extendable to other medical imaging domains to support robust development and deployment of foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

*Abdarahmane Traore,Éric Hervet,Andy Couturier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmolRGPT is a compact 600M-parameter vision-language model with region-level spatial reasoning that fuses RGB and depth cues via a three-stage curriculum, achieving competitive warehouse spatial reasoning performance and enabling deployment in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between large, computation-heavy vision-language models and the practical need for efficient, deployable multimodal systems with robust spatial understanding in industrial, robotics, and warehouse contexts.

Method: Introduce SmolRGPT, a compact VLM with RGB+depth fusion and region-level spatial reasoning. Train via a three-stage curriculum: (1) align visual and language features, (2) enable explicit spatial relationship understanding, and (3) adapt to task-specific datasets. The model uses approximately 600M parameters and targets efficiency for deployment in resource-constrained environments; code is released.

Result: Achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, matching or surpassing larger models despite far fewer parameters, demonstrating efficient spatial multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Efficient, deployable multimodal intelligence with robust spatial reasoning is achievable at small scales, enabling real-world deployment without sacrificing core capabilities; the work highlights the viability of compact VLMs for industrial applications and provides a codebase for replication.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

*Shen Sang,Tiancheng Zhi,Tianpei Gu,Jing Liu,Linjie Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lynx is a diffusion-transformer-based system for personalized video synthesis from a single image, using two lightweight adapters to preserve identity: an ID-adapter that converts ArcFace embeddings into identity tokens via a Perceiver Resampler, and a Ref-adapter that injects dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway through cross-attention. It achieves strong identity fidelity, temporal coherence, and video quality, demonstrated on 40 subjects across 800 test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of producing personalized videos from a single image requires preserving individual identity while maintaining temporal coherence and high visual realism. Traditional methods struggle to maintain fine facial details and identity consistency without heavy fine-tuning. The proposed approach aims to enhance identity fidelity and video quality by adding lightweight conditioning adapters to a diffusion-based foundation model.

Method: Build on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Introduce two adapters: (1) ID-adapter uses a Perceiver Resampler to convert ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for conditioning; (2) Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers via cross-attention. These modules together enable robust identity preservation and temporal coherence while leveraging a fixed foundation model.

Result: Evaluation on a benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 prompts (800 test cases) shows Lynx achieves superior face resemblance, competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, indicating improved identity fidelity and realistic short-form videos.

Conclusion: Lynx demonstrates that combining a diffusion-based foundation model with lightweight, targeted adapters—one for identity tokens and one for detailed reference features—can significantly improve personalized video generation from a single image, offering a practical path toward high-fidelity, coherent video synthesis.

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from
a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers
through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity
preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the
state of personalized video generation.

### [30] [Backdoor Mitigation via Invertible Pruning Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15497)
*Kealan Dunnett,Reza Arablouei,Dimity Miller,Volkan Dedeoglu,Raja Jurdak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bi-level, learned pruning framework with an invertible mask identifies and suppresses backdoor-related parameters while preserving clean-task performance, outperforming other pruning defenses and rivaling fine-tuning—especially effective with limited data and in restoring predictions on compromised samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor defenses rely on pruning, but existing pruning methods struggle to pinpoint backdoor-related parameters and often degrade clean accuracy. There is a need for a method that is interpretable, robust in low-data regimes, and capable of removing backdoors while preserving normal functionality.

Method: Introduce a bi-level optimization framework that learns: (1) a selection mechanism for parameters important to both main and backdoor tasks, (2) a sparse invertible pruning mask that can flip backdoor effects on and off, and (3) sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem uses the inverse mask to synthesize candidate triggers; the outer problem updates the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without harming clean accuracy.

Result: Experiments show the approach outperforms existing pruning-based defenses, remains strong with limited data, and is competitive with state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods. It is particularly effective at restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after mitigation.

Conclusion: A learnable, invertible pruning scheme framed as bi-level optimization provides an effective, interpretable defense against backdoors, combining the benefits of pruning (robustness, interpretability) with the performance typically attributed to fine-tuning, especially in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

### [31] [MEC-Quant: Maximum Entropy Coding for Extremely Low Bit Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15514)
*Junbiao Pang,Tianyang Cai,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MEC-Quant, a principled QAT method that minimizes representation bias via maximum entropy coding and a Mixture-of-Experts formulation, enabling end-to-end training and near-FP performance at very low-bit activations, achieving state-of-the-art results for QAT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization introduces biases in learned representations, especially in extreme low-bit regimes, causing QAT to underperform Full Precision (FP). A representation-centric objective is needed to preserve structure and improve generalization to unseen in-distribution samples. The authors use an entropy-based perspective, with a tractable surrogate via minimal coding length and a scalable MOE reformulation to handle long-tailed weight/activation distributions.

Method: Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant): an end-to-end trainable objective that optimizes the entropy-related structure of representations. Uses minimal coding length as a surrogate for entropy, and derives a scalable Mixture Of Experts (MOE) formulation to handle long-tailed distributions and enable fast computation across layers.

Result: Extensive computer vision experiments show MEC-Quant outperforms standard QAT baselines, pushing achievable accuracy to x-bit activations and matching or surpassing FP performance. Reported as achieving a new state of the art for QAT without extra engineering tricks.

Conclusion: MEC-Quant successfully reduces representation bias induced by quantization, enabling better generalization and極 performance in low-bit regimes. It establishes a new benchmark for QAT and demonstrates that entropy-based coding with MOE can lead to practical, end-to-end trainable quantization strategies.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

*Xianhang Ye,Yiqing Li,Wei Dai,Miancan Liu,Ziyuan Chen,Zhangye Han,Hongbo Min,Jinkui Ren,Xiantao Zhang,Wen Yang,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-ARP introduces adaptive multi-stage inference for GUI grounding using Adaptive Region Perception and Adaptive Stage Controlling; it combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and achieves state-of-the-art results on GUI grounding benchmarks with a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained localization in high-resolution GUI screenshots is challenging; existing methods struggle to accurately localize small or detailed UI elements. Adaptive attention cropping and an adaptive inference strategy are needed to handle varying complexity efficiently.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) to focus on task-relevant regions and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC) to switch between single-stage and multi-stage inference based on complexity. Trains via a two-phase pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning guided by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding benchmarks: a 7B model reaches 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9% on UI-Vision. It is competitive with open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Conclusion: The GUI-ARP framework demonstrates the effectiveness of adaptive, attention-guided, multi-stage inference for GUI grounding, delivering strong accuracy with smaller models and showing potential for efficient deployment in real-world high-resolution GUI understanding.

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

*Sen Wang,Jingyi Tian,Le Wang,Zhimin Liao,Jiayi Li,Huaiyi Dong,Kun Xia,Sanping Zhou,Wei Tang,Hua Gang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO is a hybrid scale-wise autoregressive model for action-conditioned video prediction that combines intra-frame visual autoregression with inter-frame causal decoding, enhanced by an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer and a trajectory-aware motion prompt. It achieves faster rollout (4.4x) and improved temporal consistency, with strong generalization and scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive world models struggle to produce visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure during decoding, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling, hindering long-horizon planning and control.

Method: SAMPO integrates scale-wise visual autoregression for intra-frame generation with causal decoding for subsequent frames, enabling temporal causal decoding alongside bidirectional spatial attention to preserve locality and support parallel decoding within scales. It introduces an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer to retain spatial details in observed frames while extracting compact dynamic representations for future frames, improving memory efficiency. A trajectory-aware motion prompt module injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories to focus attention on dynamic regions, boosting temporal consistency and physical realism.

Result: Experiments show competitive performance on action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, with 4.4× faster inference. SAMPO demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks and benefits from larger model sizes, indicating favorable scaling behavior.

Conclusion: SAMPO successfully fuses intra-frame visual autoregression with inter-frame causal modeling across multiple scales, preserving spatial locality, improving temporal consistency and rollout efficiency, and enabling better generalization and scalability for dynamic scene understanding and planning.

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

### [34] [Beyond Words: Enhancing Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition with Non-Verbal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15540)
*Wei Chen,Tongguan Wang,Feiyue Xue,Junkai Li,Hui Liu,Ying Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A symmetrical bidirectional multimodal framework (SyDES) for desire, emotion, and sentiment recognition that jointly leverages text and image cues. It uses global low-resolution images for cross-modal alignment, plus high-resolution sub-images with masked image modeling for local detail, with text-guided image decoding and image-guided text decoding to enable deep cross-modal interaction. Evaluated on MSED, it yields modest but consistent gains across desire understanding, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis, and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Desire understanding in multimodal contexts remains underexplored and current sentiment analysis often underutilizes visual cues. Capturing intention-related signals requires integrating text with non-verbal image information to improve recognition of desire, emotion, and sentiment.

Method: Propose SyDES, a symmetrical bidirectional multimodal framework. Use low-resolution images for global visual representations to align modalities cross-modally; partition high-resolution images into sub-images and apply masked image modeling to capture local features; introduce a text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder to enable deep cross-modal interaction at both global and local levels; adopt a mixed-scale image strategy by cropping high-resolution images into sub-images for masked modeling to balance performance and computation; evaluate on MSED across desire, emotion, and sentiment benchmarks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MSED with F1-score gains of 1.1% for desire understanding, 0.6% for emotion recognition, and 0.9% for sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures intention-related representations through symmetrical bidirectional cross-modal interaction and strategically combining global and local visual cues via masked sub-image modeling, achieving consistent improvements across desire, emotion, and sentiment tasks and providing a publicly available codebase.

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/especiallyW/SyDES.

### [35] [Enhancing Sa2VA for Referent Video Object Segmentation: 2nd Solution for 7th LSVOS RVOS Track](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15546)
*Ran Hong,Feng Lu,Leilei Cao,An Yan,Youhai Jiang,Fengjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free RVOS enhancement for Sa2VA via a Video-Language Checker and Key-Frame Sampler, boosting J&F to 64.14% on MeViS and securing 2nd in LSVOS 2025 RVOS track.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS requires precise alignment between vision and language; existing Sa2VA suffers from false positives and limited temporal coverage. A training-free fix to verify query presence and select informative frames can improve performance.

Method: Introduce a Video-Language Checker to confirm that the query's subject and action appear in the video; introduce a Key-Frame Sampler to adaptively select frames that capture early appearances and long-range temporal context. Both components operate without additional training and integrate with Sa2VA's LLM-SAM framework.

Result: Achieves 64.14% J&F on the MeViS test set; ranks 2nd in the RVOS track at the 7th LSVOS Challenge (ICCV 2025).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that explicit query verification and adaptive frame sampling yield significant, training-free gains for RVOS, with potential generalization to other vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Motivation: To address challenges in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from in-the-wild photo collections that have limited imagery and multiple appearances, which cause oversmoothing and overfitting in existing NeRF/3DGS methods.

Method: Extend 3D Gaussian Splatting with (i) monocular depth priors to bootstrap geometry; (ii) extraction of local semantic regions via a Structure-from-Motion points anchored alignment for reliable geometry cues; (iii) geometry-guided supervision at virtual (synthetic) views in coarse and fine schemes to enforce 3D consistency and mitigate overfitting; (iv) dataset creation and in-the-wild experiments to benchmark realism and robustness.

Result: MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and significantly outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets; a new in-the-wild dataset and experiment setting are introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed MS-GS framework demonstrates that combining depth priors, semantic-region alignment, and geometry-guided virtual-view supervision yields robust, photorealistic multi-appearance 3D reconstructions from sparse data, addressing oversmoothing and overfitting and enabling more realistic in-the-wild rendering.

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

### [37] [Diffusion-Based Cross-Modal Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15553)
*Tian Lan,Yiming Zheng,Jianxin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-Feat extracts and fuses intermediate diffusion-Transformer features from pre-trained DiT models for both images and text to perform multi-label classification; uses a local-search heuristic to select an optimal image-text-layer-timestep pair; achieves state-of-the-art results on MS-COCO-enhanced and Visual Genome 500 and shows tighter semantic clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-label classification by leveraging discriminative intermediate representations from diffusion-based transformers for both vision and language, and to avoid exhaustive search for feature selection.

Method: Extract intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text; observe modality-specific best steps (vision: middle step, middle block; language: deepest block at noise-free step); apply a local-search heuristic to select the best image-text x block-timestep pair from candidates; fuse via a simple fusion-linear projection and addition of the selected representations.

Result: Achieves 98.6% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7% mAP on Visual Genome 500; outperforms CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines; t-SNE and clustering metrics show tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Conclusion: Diff-Feat demonstrates a simple yet powerful approach to multi-label classification by leveraging discriminative diffusion-based intermediate features and cross-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Practical, end-to-end co-design approach for deploying AI-assisted telehealth in resource-constrained settings, emphasizing iterative prototyping, domain-shift challenges, and automated image quality checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability in resource-constrained settings with few specialists. Scalable AI-assisted screening and telehealth could improve early detection, but real-world deployment is hindered by paper-based workflows and limited field experience.

Method: Iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through early prototyping, shadow deployment, and continuous feedback. Document field challenges, leverage public datasets/models (despite domain shift), and develop automated image quality checks. Treat AI development and workflow digitization as an end-to-end co-design process.

Result: Identified key practical challenges and lessons learned for adopting AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening in resource-constrained settings. Public datasets/models are useful but underperform due to domain shift; automated image quality assessment is needed to ensure gradable images in high-volume camps.

Conclusion: To close the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge, documentation of field challenges and iterative co-design are essential for building real-world AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

### [39] [DC-Mamba: Bi-temporal deformable alignment and scale-sparse enhancement for remote sensing change detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15563)
*Min Sun,Fenghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Mamba proposes an align-then-enhance RSCD framework that adds BTDA deformable alignment and SSCA amplification to the ChangeMamba backbone, achieving improved detection of subtle changes by correcting geometric misalignment and selectively boosting high-confidence changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote-sensing change detection methods struggle with geometric misalignments and noise, making subtle true changes hard to distinguish from pseudo-changes; there is a need for explicit geometric alignment and selective signal amplification.

Method: Two plug-and-play modules: (1) Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA) introduces geometric awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; (2) Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier (SSCA) uses multi-source cues to selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise, integrated with the ChangeMamba backbone in an align-then-enhance pipeline.

Result: On the ChangeMamba backbone, DC-Mamba improves F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU from 0.4015 to 0.4187, indicating stronger change detection and better boundary delineation.

Conclusion: The align-then-enhance approach effectively addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in RSCD, offering a robust, deployable solution that enhances detection of subtle changes.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Blink-Think-Link (BTL), a brain-inspired three-phase framework for AI-driven human-GUI interaction, plus Blink Data Generation and BTL Reward, culminating in the BTL-UI GUI agent that achieves state-of-the-art performance on static and dynamic GUI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current AI-driven interaction logic and natural human-GUI communication patterns, by aligning GUI automation with human cognitive processes for more natural, effective interaction.

Method: Decomposes interaction into Blink (rapid attention to screen regions), Think (high-level reasoning), and Link (execution). Introduces Blink Data Generation for automated blink annotations and a rule-based BTL Reward for reinforcement learning. Builds the BTL-UI agent and evaluates on static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction benchmarks.

Result: BTL-UI demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction benchmarks, with empirical evidence supporting the framework’s efficacy.

Conclusion: A cognitively inspired framework that narrows the gap between AI-driven GUI automation and human-like interaction, producing an effective GUI agent (BTL-UI) and offering new data/reward mechanisms for RL in GUI tasks.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

### [41] [Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15573)
*Shilong Bao,Qianqian Xu,Feiran Li,Boyu Han,Zhiyong Yang,Xiaochun Cao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) and Size-Invariant Optimization (SIOpt) for Salient Object Detection (SOD) to mitigate bias toward large objects. Grounded in a theoretical decomposition showing that current metrics weight regions by size; SIOpt is model-agnostic and improves performance across object sizes; validated by experiments; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOD metrics are sensitive to region size, causing large salient regions to dominate scores and small, potentially important objects to be undervalued. This leads to biased evaluations and degraded real-world performance when multiple objects of varying sizes appear.

Method: Derives that image-level SOD metrics can be decomposed into separable terms proportional to each region's size. Proposes Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) to assess each component separately and aggregate results. Develops SIOpt, a size-invariant optimization framework that can be integrated with various SOD backbones, and provides a generalization analysis of SOD methods under the new protocol.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework across a broad range of object sizes, along with theoretical generalization insights supporting the validity of the approach.

Conclusion: SIEva and SIOpt address size sensitivity in SOD, enabling fairer, more robust evaluation and improved detection across scales. The framework is backbone-agnostic and accompanied by generalized analysis; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Conclusion: HFN and VESV advance short-video fake news detection by offering a robust, multimodal framework and a domain-specific dataset, guiding future research toward more reliable misinformation detection on short video platforms.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced

harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of
short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel
multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate
the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that
dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted
Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV

detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over

effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video
platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at general video tasks but struggle with fast, information-dense sports like tennis; there is a need for a systematic, domain-specific benchmark to evaluate and guide improvements.

Method: Introduce TennisTV: a rally-centric benchmark that treats each rally as a temporal sequence of stroke events, uses automated pipelines for filtering and question generation, covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels, and includes 2,500 human-verified questions; evaluate 16 representative MLLMs.

Result: The benchmark reveals substantial shortcomings of current MLLMs in tennis video understanding; two key insights emerge: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.

Conclusion: TennisTV sets a foundation for targeted improvements in MLLMs for fast sports, emphasizing the need for task-aware sampling strategies and enhanced temporal grounding to achieve robust tennis video understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips

*Zheng Wang,Hong Liu,Zheng Wang,Danyi Li,Min Cen,Baptiste Magnier,Li Liang,Liansheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rasa combines LLM-derived textual descriptions from pathology reports with a self-distillation framework and risk-aware data augmentation to improve WSI-based survival analysis, achieving superior results on CRC and TCGA-BRCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI features are noisy and data-limited; pathology reports contain rich, patient-specific information that can enhance prognosis but are underutilized; leveraging text can guide feature selection and modeling.

Method: 1) Use task-prompted LLMs to extract WSI-relevant textual cues from noisy pathology reports; 2) A teacher-student self-distillation to filter and align WSI features with linguistic knowledge; 3) risk-aware mix-up to expand training data while improving diversity and preserving prognostic structure.

Result: Rasa outperforms state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on CRC and TCGA-BRCA; code is released.

Conclusion: Integrating textual knowledge via LLMs and self-distillation with risk-aware data augmentation yields more robust prognostic modeling from WSIs, underscoring the value of cross-modal information in pathology.

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

### [46] [PCSR: Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement for Noisy Correspondence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15623)
*Zhuoyao Liu,Yang Liu,Wentao Feng,Shudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PCSR, a pseudo-label consistency-guided framework to refine noisy image-text pairs for robust cross-modal retrieval, using confidence-based clean/noisy split, pseudo-label consistency to subdivide noise, PCS score, and adaptive pair optimization (robust loss for ambiguous, text replacement for refinable); validated on CC152K, MS-COCO, Flickr30K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy correspondences in image-text data degrade cross-modal retrieval performance. Existing methods rely on coarse clean/noisy splits and uniform training, failing to leverage the intrinsic diversity within noisy data.

Method: 1) Confidence-based estimation to separate clean vs noisy samples; 2) Use pseudo-label consistency to refine noisy samples into structurally distinct subgroups; 3) Introduce Pseudo-label Consistency Score (PCS) to measure prediction stability and separate ambiguous vs refinable noisy samples; 4) Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO): train ambiguous samples with robust loss; enrich refinable samples via text replacement during training.

Result: Empirical validation on CC152K, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K shows improved retrieval robustness under noisy supervision, demonstrating the effectiveness of PCSR and APO.

Conclusion: PCSR addresses misalignment and diversity in noisy image-text pairs, enabling adaptive, sample-aware training that enhances cross-modal retrieval robustness under noisy labeling.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated SAM framework for medical image segmentation that updates only global parameters to capture cross-client commonalities while preserving a Localized Mixture-of-Experts (L-MoE) for domain-specific features, plus a teacher-student distillation-based global-local fine-tuning to reduce overgeneralization; shows improved segmentation, cross-domain robustness, and lower communication cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving collaboration across institutions for medical image segmentation; SAM's large encoder makes standard FL challenging; need personalization to handle heterogeneous data while leveraging powerful segmentation capabilities.

Method: Two innovations: (1) personalized aggregation of global parameters only, with L-MoE to keep domain-specific modules; (2) decoupled global-local fine-tuning via teacher-student knowledge distillation to bridge global model and personalized local models.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate significant performance gains, robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables personalized federated segmentation with SAM in heterogeneous medical data, balancing cross-client generalization and local specialization while being communication-efficient.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Motivation: Address the gap where pretrained RGB-visible and infrared models underperform in multimodal RGB-IR settings; need effective cross-modal alignment and continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL) to align cross-modal features via attention-guided distillation inspired by retinal horizontal cells; dual-knowledge preservation using LoRA adapters (adds ~2% parameters) plus synchronous distillation to emulate cone/rod functionality; dataset MVIP; architecture-agnostic (transformer-compatible).

Result: Infrared tasks improve by +1.7 mIoU in semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection; RGB performance preserved at 99%+ of baseline.

Conclusion: UNIV demonstrates effective cross-modal alignment with minimal parameter overhead, supports cross-modal learning for RGB-IR perception, and provides the MVIP dataset and coderelease for reproducibility.

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

### [49] [GS-Scale: Unlocking Large-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting Training via Host Offloading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15645)
*Donghyun Lee,Dawoon Jeong,Jae W. Lee,Hongil Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Scale is a memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting that offloads Gaussians to host memory with three CPU-assisted optimizations, achieving 3.3–5.6x GPU memory reduction while preserving GPU-like training speed and enabling scaling from 4M to 18M Gaussians with notable perceptual gains (LPIPS 23–35%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting is memory-bound; storing parameters, gradients, and optimizer states overwhelms GPU memory, hindering high-quality, fast training on consumer GPUs.

Method: Store Gaussians in host memory; on-demand subset transfer to GPU per forward/backward pass; three optimizations: selective offloading of geometric params for fast frustum culling; parameter forwarding to a pipeline CPU optimizer while GPU computes; deferred optimizer updates to skip rarely-used Gaussians with zero gradients.

Result: GPU memory usage reduced by 3.3–5.6x; training speeds comparable to GPU-only setup; scales Gaussians from 4M to 18M on RTX 4070 Mobile; LPIPS improvement 23–35%.

Conclusion: GS-Scale enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer GPUs with substantial memory savings and competitive performance, broadening accessibility for high-quality rendering pipelines.

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

*Yuwei Jia,Yutang Lu,Zhe Cui,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D fingerprint registration, reconstruction, and generation framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to convert sparse 2D inputs into accurate 3D fingerprints and generate contactless fingerprints from 3D models, without camera calibration; claims first application of Gaussian Splatting to fingerprint recognition and improved recognition performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lag in contactless fingerprint recognition caused by limited 3D representations, pose variation, and lack of implicit 3D models; aims to enable robust 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs and generate contactless fingerprints without camera parameters.

Method: Integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting for registration, reconstruction, and generation. Works with sparse 2D inputs to produce accurate 3D fingerprint models and then generate high-quality 2D-like contactless fingerprints from the 3D model, without requiring camera parameters.

Result: Experiments show accurate 3D registration and reconstruction from 2D images and sequential generation of high-quality contactless fingerprints from the 3D model, thereby enhancing performance for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Conclusion: This work is the first to apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to fingerprint recognition and to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of contactless fingerprints with sparse inputs and no camera calibration, establishing a new paradigm that couples 3D reconstruction with generation for contactless recognition.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

### [51] [A PCA Based Model for Surface Reconstruction from Incomplete Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15675)
*Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCA-based regularized surface reconstruction for incomplete point clouds using an operator-splitting solver, achieving improved reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete point cloud data due to occlusions and high light-absorption can leave surfaces partially uncovered; a robust method is needed to infer missing regions.

Method: Estimate surface normals from available points via PCA and use these normals as a regularizer in a surface reconstruction model; solve the resulting optimization with an operator-splitting method.

Result: Experiments demonstrate successful inference of surface structures in data-missing regions and accurate reconstruction of the underlying surfaces, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: A PCA-informed regularization with operator-splitting provides effective reconstruction for incomplete point clouds and offers superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

### [52] [Camera Splatting for Continuous View Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15677)
*Gahye Lee,Hyomin Kim,Gwangjin Ju,Jooeun Son,Hyejeong Yoon,Seungyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera Splatting proposes a differentiable view optimization framework that treats cameras as 3D Gaussians (camera splats) and optimizes their shapes/positions via observations from nearby point cameras, outperforming Farthest View Sampling (FVS) in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena such as metallic reflections and textures like text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of fixed, predefined view sampling methods (e.g., Farthest View Sampling) in novel view synthesis, especially for challenging view-dependent effects and textures, by enabling continuous, differentiable optimization of camera placements and appearances.

Method: Represent each camera as a 3D Gaussian ('camera splat'). Place virtual point cameras near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats. Perform differentiable optimization of the camera splats so that the observed distributions from the point cameras match target distributions, following a process akin to 3D Gaussian splatting. Compare optimized views against FVS.

Result: The optimized views better capture complex view-dependent phenomena, achieving superior handling of intense metallic reflections and intricate textures (e.g., text) compared to FVS.

Conclusion: Camera Splatting provides a more expressive, effective view optimization framework for novel view synthesis, outperforming FVS in challenging scenarios that involve complex materials and textures.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

### [53] [Layout Stroke Imitation: A Layout Guided Handwriting Stroke Generation for Style Imitation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15678)
*Sidra Hanif,Longin Jan Latecki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based handwriting stroke generator that conditions on calligraphic style and explicit word layout, using multi-scale attention to capture local/global style; it outperforms stroke-generation baselines and rivals image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistent word spacing and lack of layout modeling in handwriting style imitation by explicitly modeling word layout and stroke-level generation, improving handwriting recognition, writer ordering, and calligraphy-style replication.

Method: Introduce multi-scale attention-based style embeddings to capture local and global stroke features; explicitly incorporate word layout as a feature; employ a conditional diffusion model to predict stroke trajectories rather than generating style images, providing temporal coordinates for strokes conditioned on style and layout.

Result: The proposed diffusion model achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art stroke-generation methods and is competitive with recent image-generation networks.

Conclusion: Modeling both multi-scale calligraphic style and explicit word layout within a conditional diffusion framework yields improved handwriting stroke generation and imitation, suggesting benefits for handwriting-related tasks and calligraphy-style synthesis.

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Kangyu Wu,Jiaqi Qiao,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPAD is a lightweight cooperative trajectory prediction framework that fuses multi-source trajectory data using Hungarian–Kalman fusion, enriched by Past Time Attention and mode attention, plus an anchor-based decoder, achieving state-of-the-art results on DAIR-V2X-Seq.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-vehicle perception can be unstable in real-world driving, limiting trajectory prediction. There is a need for cooperative trajectory prediction leveraging data from vehicles and road infrastructure to improve trajectory completeness and accuracy.

Method: CoPAD integrates an early fusion module (Hungarian algorithm + Kalman filtering) to combine multi-source data, a Past Time Attention (PTA) module to extract interaction information from historical trajectories, a mode attention module to diversify predictions, and an anchor-oriented decoder (AoD) to generate complete trajectories with sparse anchors.

Result: Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset demonstrate that CoPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance for cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: CoPAD offers a lightweight, effective approach to cooperative trajectory prediction, mitigating single-vehicle perception instability and providing accurate, diverse trajectory forecasts through cooperative sensing and advanced decoding.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

### [55] [Saccadic Vision for Fine-Grained Visual Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15688)
*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage, saccade-inspired FGVC method that samples non-redundant fixation patches via peripheral features and a shared encoder, achieving competitive results and outperforming its baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained visual classification is difficult due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Existing part-based localization networks are complex and suffer redundancy; there is a need for efficient, informative sampling that benefits downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes a two-stage process: (1) extract peripheral features (coarse view) and generate a sample map; (2) sample fixation patches and encode in parallel using a weight-shared encoder. Uses contextualized selective attention to weigh each patch and fuses peripheral and focused representations. Applies non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to prevent spatial collapse and redundancy.

Result: Evaluations on FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101, Stanford-Dogs) and insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths, AMI-Moths) show performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while consistently outperforming the authors’ baseline encoder.

Conclusion: The saccadic-inspired sampling with attention and redundancy-reducing suppression yields competitive FGVC performance with efficient, shared-encoder architecture and reduced spatial redundancy.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

*Aurélien Cecille,Stefan Duffner,Franck Davoine,Rémi Agier,Thibault Neveu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models per-pixel depth as a mixture distribution to preserve depth discontinuities under self-supervision, improving boundary sharpness without fine-grained supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sharp depth boundaries are often blurred in monocular self-supervised depth estimation; capturing multiple plausible depths per pixel can maintain geometric edges and reflect inherent ambiguity.

Method: Represent depth as a per-pixel mixture distribution; shift uncertainty from regression to mixture weights; integrate with variance-aware loss and uncertainty propagation within existing pipelines.

Result: Outperforms baselines on KITTI and VKITTIv2 with up to 35% better depth boundary sharpness and improved point cloud quality.

Conclusion: A probabilistic per-pixel depth model under self-supervision can achieve crisper depth edges and better 3D reconstructions without extra supervision.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

*Cristian Sbrolli,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneForge introduces structured multi-object scene compositions with explicit spatial relations and LLM-refined multi-object descriptions to enrich 3D-text contrastive learning, enabling stronger cross-modal alignment and diverse downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-text datasets are scarce; enriching data complexity and diversity through compositional, spatially-grounded scenes can improve cross-modal alignment and generalization.

Method: Construct multi-object 3D scenes from individual shapes with explicit spatial relations; pair with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model; incorporate compositional samples into contrastive training; study design choices (object count, compositional sample ratio, scene construction); model-agnostic augmentation across encoders.

Result: Substantial gains across tasks and datasets: zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet; few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart; improved 3D VQA on ScanQA; robust retrieval with increasing scene complexity; demonstrated spatial reasoning by following textual instructions. Compositional augmentations are encoder-agnostic and benefit multiple architectures.

Conclusion: Structured compositional data augmentation can alleviate 3D-text data scarcity, enrich training diversity, and enhance 3D-text alignment and reasoning across a range of vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

*Zhaoyang Li,Zhan Ling,Yuchen Zhou,Hao Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORIC is a new benchmark for evaluating LVLMs on object recognition in incongruous contexts, using two sampling strategies to provoke errors. It shows substantial recognition gaps across 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs integrate vision and language but fail in incongruous contexts where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent; this causes misidentification and hallucination. A systematic benchmark is needed to quantify and analyze context-aware recognition failures.

Method: ORIC uses two sampling strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to detect plausible yet nonexistent objects, creating incongruous context. The benchmark evaluates 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models.

Result: Evaluation reveals significant recognition gaps when context is incongruous, highlighting the challenges LVLMs face in contextual reasoning and the presence of object misidentification and hallucination.

Conclusion: ORIC provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations in context-aware object recognition and motivates further research to improve how LVLMs understand object-context relationships.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A supervised multimodal framework to reconstruct 3D cloud phase structures from VIS/TIR satellite imagery using synchronized lidar/radar profiles, introducing a benchmark dataset and showing SGMAGNet outperforms baselines on standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve numerical weather prediction by providing high-fidelity 3D cloud phase profiles and enabling closer integration of satellite observations with NWP parameterizations; enhance cloud microphysics representations.

Method: Construct a benchmark of synchronized VIS/TIR image patches and vertical cloud phase profiles from CALIOP/CALIPSO and CPR/CloudSat. Train and evaluate SGMAGNet as the main model, compare against UNet variants and SegNet. Assess using Precision, Recall, F1-score, IoU across diverse cloud regimes, with emphasis on complex multi-layer/boundary regions.

Result: SGMAGNet achieves Precision 0.922, Recall 0.858, F1-score 0.763, IoU 0.617, consistently outperforming baselines, particularly in challenging multi-layer and boundary transition regions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of supervised learning for 3D cloud phase reconstruction from multimodal satellite data and its potential for operational retrieval and integration with NWP. The provided benchmark and baseline model establish a foundation for future improvements in dataset scale, model architectures, and real-time deployment.

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

### [60] [Training-Free Pyramid Token Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models via Region, Token, and Instruction-Guided Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15704)
*Yuxuan Liang,Xu Li,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP) approach reduces tokens and computation in LVLMs handling high-res images by combining bottom-up saliency (region and token level) with top-down instruction-guided importance, achieving large efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss across 13 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel at multimodal understanding but must process high-resolution images, causing token explosion and heavy computation. Training-time retraining or heavy patching is costly; there is a need for a lightweight, training-free method to prune tokens without hurting performance.

Method: PTP integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance to select tokens. It prunes tokens before processing, retaining more tokens in visually salient regions and leveraging textual instructions to identify tokens relevant to the task. It is designed as a training-free pruning strategy.

Result: Experiments across 13 benchmarks show substantial reductions in computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: PTP offers a practical, training-free token pruning approach for high-resolution LVLMs, aligning with human visual attention to enable efficient multimodal processing without retraining.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Motivation: Accurate indoor floor plan reconstruction from point clouds is essential for navigation, BIM, and measurement, but existing geometric or CNN-based methods struggle with noise, generalization, and preserving geometry.

Method: Build top-down density maps from LiDAR with grid filtering, adaptive projection, image enhancement; apply SAM for zero-shot room segmentation; generate room masks via adaptive prompts and multistage filtering; combine masks with point cloud to extract contours and enforce regularization; recover topology.

Result: On Giblayout and ISPRS datasets, FloorSAM achieves higher accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially under noise and complex layouts.

Conclusion: FloorSAM offers accurate, topology-preserving floor plans and demonstrates robustness; code available at github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

*Shuaibo Li,Zhaohu Xing,Hongqiu Wang,Pengfei Hao,Xingyu Li,Zekai Liu,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MedForensics dataset and DSKI detector for AI-generated medical images; achieves superior detection across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter risks posed by AI-generated medical images (diagnostic deception, fraud, misinformation) amid a lack of large-scale, domain-specific forensic datasets and inadequate existing methods.

Method: Proposes DSKI with two components: CDFA (cross-domain fine-trace adapter) to extract subtle forgery clues in spatial/noise domains during training, and MFRM (medical forensic retrieval module) enabling few-shot retrieval during testing; builds a vision-language feature space for medical image forensics; together with MedForensics dataset (six modalities, twelve generative models).

Result: DSKI significantly outperforms existing methods and human experts, delivering superior accuracy across multiple medical modalities.

Conclusion: DSKI and MedForensics provide effective tools for detecting AI-generated medical images, addressing a critical research gap and enabling robust forensic analysis in medical imaging.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

*Laixin Zhang,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueMoE uses a dual-routing mixture-of-discriminative-experts to detect synthetic images by leveraging multiple specialized subspaces, achieving better generalization and robustness than single universal discriminators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified discriminative spaces are brittle and struggle to generalize to unseen generative patterns; leveraging diverse forgery cues via multiple subspaces can improve generalization.

Method: Introduce Discriminative Expert Array along manifold structure and perceptual granularity axes; implement dual-routing: a granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router to assign inputs to relevant experts; collaborative inference across subspaces.

Result: Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of generative models show superior generalization and robustness to unseen patterns.

Conclusion: A dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework with specialized subspaces provides a robust, generalizable approach for synthetic image detection, reducing brittleness of single-space detectors.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

### [64] [Ideal Registration? Segmentation is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15784)
*Xiang Chen,Fengting Zhang,Qinghao Liu,Min Liu,Kun Wu,Yaonan Wang,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg introduces segmentation-driven, anatomically adaptive regularization for image registration, converting a global registration problem into region-specific subproblems guided by segmentation, achieving high Dice scores and outperforming baseline methods across cardiac, abdominal, and lung datasets; accuracy scales with segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current registration approaches rely on globally uniform smoothness constraints that fail to capture regionally varying anatomical motion; segmentation-based regionally adaptive regularization aims to model region-specific deformations.

Method: Decompose moving and fixed images into anatomically coherent subregions via segmentation; apply the same registration backbone to each region to compute localized partial deformation fields; integrate partial deformations into a global deformation field; evaluate with ground-truth and automatic segmentation.

Result: Achieves Dice ~98.23% on critical anatomies with ground-truth segmentation; outperforms existing methods by 2–12% across cardiac, abdominal, and lung registrations; shows near-linear dependence of accuracy on segmentation quality; code to be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SegReg reframes registration as a segmentation-driven problem, enabling anatomically adaptive regularization; segmentation quality largely governs registration accuracy; practical deployment is feasible with automatic segmentation.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

*Tony Lindeberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariant receptive field families under natural image transformations are studied; the paper derives infinitesimal and macroscopic relationships across the multi-parameter shape spaces, enabling efficient computation and theoretical modeling of simple cells.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image variability under geometric transformations motivates using covariant receptive fields and relating responses across different parameter values.

Method: Derives infinitesimal relationships leveraging semi-group and Lie group concepts; establishes macroscopic cascade smoothing showing how coarser-scale responses can be obtained from finer-scale responses via incremental filters; applies to multi-parameter receptive field families.

Result: Provides a deeper understanding of how spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses relate across different filter parameters; suggests more efficient computation schemes for multi-parameter receptor fields; informs idealized models of simple cells in biology.

Conclusion: Offers theoretical foundations for handling multi-parameter receptive fields under transformations, with implications for efficient computation and biologically plausible modeling of vision.

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

### [66] [CBPNet: A Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network for Alleviating Plasticity Loss on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15785)
*Runjie Shao,Boyu Diao,Zijia An,Ruiqi Liu,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBPNet is a parameter-efficient continual learning framework for edge devices that combats plasticity loss in frozen-pretrained, prompt-based models by adaptively reinitializing underutilized parameters via an Efficient CBP Block, achieving +1%+ average accuracy on Split CIFAR-100 and a new state-of-the-art 69.41% on Split ImageNet-R with less than 0.2% extra backbone parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time continual learning on edge devices (e.g., robotics, autonomous driving) requires efficient adaptation. Frozen backbones with prompts help mitigate catastrophic forgetting but introduce plasticity loss due to limited trainable parameters. The paper argues that underutilized parameters lack update vitality, hindering learning.

Method: Introduce Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet) featuring an Efficient CBP Block that adaptively reinitializes underutilized parameters to restore learning vitality. The approach trains additional parameters constituting less than 0.2% of the backbone while keeping the backbone frozen.

Result: Empirical results show improved performance: on Split CIFAR-100, average accuracy improves by over 1% over a strong baseline; on Split ImageNet-R, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.41%. These gains are achieved with a very small parameter overhead relative to the backbone.

Conclusion: CBPNet effectively mitigates plasticity decay in prompt-based continual learning on edge devices by reactivating underutilized parameters, enabling better learning with minimal extra parameter cost.

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

### [67] [Simulated Cortical Magnification Supports Self-Supervised Object Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15751)
*Zhengyang Yu,Arthur Aubret,Chen Yu,Jochen Triesch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating foveated, non-uniform visual resolution into self-supervised learning on egocentric data improves emergent object representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap that most self-supervised, toddler-like visual models use uniform input and ignore foveal-peripheral resolution, potentially limiting realism and performance.

Method: Modify egocentric video inputs with foveation and cortical magnification to blur periphery; train two bio-inspired, time-based self-supervised models on these sequences.

Result: Foveated inputs improve the quality of learned object representations; improvement attributed to objects appearing larger and a better central-peripheral information trade-off.

Conclusion: Accounting for human-like foveation makes learning more realistic and improves performance; a step toward better human-like visual representation learning.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

### [68] [ChronoForge-RL: Chronological Forging through Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15800)
*Kehua Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel RL-based video understanding framework, ChronoForge-RL, uses differentiable keyframe selection with Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to efficiently select informative frames and reason temporally, achieving state-of-the-art results with a compact 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two bottlenecks in video understanding: (1) computational infeasibility of processing every frame in dense videos, and (2) naive uniform sampling failing to pick semantically important frames.

Method: Introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism with a three-stage process to identify semantic inflection points. Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) uses variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation to select informative frames. KF-GRPO applies a contrastive learning framework with a saliency-enhanced reward to leverage frame content and temporal relations.

Result: ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench, outperforming baselines. A 7B parameter model attains performance comparable to 72B parameter alternatives.

Conclusion: The framework delivers efficient, effective video understanding by combining selective keyframe reasoning (via TAD) with reinforced temporal policies (via KF-GRPO), enabling smaller models to approach the performance of much larger ones.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

*Yang Li,Tingfa Xu,Shuyan Bai,Peifu Liu,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCOD is the first multispectral camouflaged object detection benchmark, showing that spectral information improves detection robustness over RGB and providing challenging real-world data with pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB COD methods struggle under difficult conditions; multispectral imagery offers richer spectral cues for better foreground-background discrimination. There is a lack of multispectral COD benchmarks, hindering progress.

Method: Introducing MCOD, a dataset with comprehensive challenge attributes, diverse real-world scenarios, and high-quality pixel-level masks and attribute labels. The authors benchmark eleven COD methods on MCOD and analyze performance under increasing task difficulty, highlighting the gains from multispectral data.

Result: Across benchmarking, multispectral modalities substantially mitigate performance degradation due to task difficulty. Using spectral information improves COD robustness relative to RGB-only baselines, validating the dataset's premise and utility.

Conclusion: MCOD provides a foundation for advancing multispectral COD research. The dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub URL and is expected to spur development of more robust multispectral COD methods.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

### [70] [CIDER: A Causal Cure for Brand-Obsessed Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15803)
*Fangjian Shen,Zifeng Liang,Chao Wang,Wushao Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDER is a model-agnostic, inference-time fix for brand bias in text-to-image generation. It uses a lightweight brand detector and a vision-language model to rewrite prompts into stylistically divergent, brand-free alternatives, quantified by a Brand Neutrality Score (BNS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often overproduce branded content from generic prompts, creating ethical and legal risks. A retraining-free, inference-time solution is desirable.

Method: A lightweight detector flags branded content in prompts; a Vision-Language Model generates neutral or divergent alternative prompts. CIDER applies prompt refinement at inference time and uses Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to measure bias.

Result: Experiments on leading T2I models show CIDER substantially reduces explicit and implicit brand biases while preserving image quality and aesthetics.

Conclusion: CIDER offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to producing original, brand-neutral content and contributes to safer, more trustworthy generative AI without retraining.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

*Herve Goeau,Vincent Espitalier,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlantCLEF 2024 introduces a weakly-labeled, multi-label plot-image classification task across 800+ species, using 1.7M training images and thousands of test images, to benchmark AI-assisted ecological surveys; paper describes data, methodology, models, and results of participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI could significantly enhance ecological sampling by enabling scalable, efficient identification of plant species on high-resolution plot images, expanding scope and coverage of biodiversity monitoring.

Method: The task is a weakly-labeled multi-label classification on high-resolution plot images. Training uses single-label images, while evaluation requires identifying all species present on a plot. The dataset includes 1.7 million training images and thousands of test images annotated across over 800 species. State-of-the-art vision transformers pre-trained on this data are used by participants, and the paper provides a detailed description of data, evaluation methodology, and models.

Result: The abstract reports that results achieved by participants are presented, but it does not provide specific numerical metrics.

Conclusion: The paper offers a comprehensive overview of the PlantCLEF 2024 dataset, evaluation framework, participating methods, and results, positioning the benchmark as a resource to advance AI-assisted ecological studies.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

*Weimin Bai,Yubo Li,Weijian Luo,Wenzheng Chen,He Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VLM-enhanced SDS pipeline (VLM3D) uses large vision-language models as differentiable semantic and spatial priors to achieve better semantic alignment and 3D consistency than CLIP-based SDS in text-to-3D generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-style encoders provide coarse semantic alignment and struggle with fine-grained prompts; 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, leading to geometric inconsistencies in multi-object scenes.

Method: Integrate vision-language models into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors, leveraging rich language-grounded supervision and inherent spatial understanding. Implement with Qwen2.5-VL and evaluate on GPTeval3D.

Result: Significant improvements over prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness across diverse objects and complex scenes.

Conclusion: Incorporating VLMs into SDS provides stronger semantic and spatial guidance for 3D generation, improving single-object fidelity and multi-object relational reasoning; validated on GPTeval3D with VLM3D.

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

*Chang Soo Lim,Joonyoung Moon,Donghyeon Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a framework that fuses SAM2's ViT encoder with Cutie's query-based segmentation, adds a motion prediction module for temporal stability, and ensembles Cutie, SAM2, and SCOPE to improve video object segmentation, achieving 3rd place in MOSEv2 at the LSVOS-7 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cutie and SAM2 each excel in different aspects but suffer from limited feature capacity and weak temporal modeling. Video object segmentation benefits from richer representations and stable temporal predictions, motivating a method that combines strong feature extractors with motion-aware temporal cues and model ensembling.

Method: Replace Cutie's encoder with SAM2's ViT encoder to enrich feature representations; introduce a motion prediction module to improve temporal stability; apply an ensemble strategy that combines Cutie, SAM2, and the proposed SCOPE variant (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). Code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Result: Achieved 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of enriched features and motion modeling for robust VOS. The authors also provide public code.

Conclusion: Enriching feature representations via a stronger encoder and incorporating motion-based temporal modeling, together with ensembling across complementary methods, can improve VOS performance and robustness. The approach trades off additional computation and integration complexity for gains in temporal stability and segmentation quality.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

*Xingmei Wang,Xiaoyu Hu,Chengkai Huang,Ziyan Zeng,Guohao Nie,Quan Z. Sheng,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossI2P proposes self-supervised, two-stage cross-modal registration to align 2D images with 3D point clouds, using dual-path contrastive learning and a coarse-to-fine pipeline with gradient-normalized training, achieving state-of-the-art results on KITTI and nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging texture-rich but depth-ambiguous images with sparse yet metrically precise point clouds is challenging due to semantic-geometry gaps and a tendency for methods to converge to local optima; annotation-free cross-modal alignment is desirable.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) dual-path contrastive learning to create a geometric-semantic fused embedding space for annotation-free bidirectional alignment between 2D textures and 3D structures; (2) a coarse-to-fine registration pipeline with a global stage that establishes superpoint–superpixel correspondences via joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement; a dynamic training mechanism with gradient normalization balances losses for feature alignment, correspondence refinement, and pose estimation.

Result: CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, indicating significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in an end-to-end pipeline, delivering robust and accurate I2P registration by combining self-supervised embedding with global-to-local alignment and a balanced training strategy.

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

### [75] [RACap: Relation-Aware Prompting for Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15883)
*Xiaosheng Long,Hanyu Wang,Zhentao Song,Kun Luo,Hongde Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap is a lightweight, relation-aware retrieval-augmented image captioning model that combines retrieved structured relation features with explicit object identification to boost caption quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented captioning methods rely on coarse semantic prompts and lack explicit modeling of objects and their semantic relationships, limiting fine-grained relational understanding.

Method: RACap retrieves structured relation features from captions and identifies heterogeneous objects in the image, integrating these signals into the captioning model to improve semantic consistency and relational expressiveness, while using only 10.8M trainable parameters.

Result: RACap demonstrates superior performance compared with prior lightweight captioning models on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Relation-aware retrieval of structured relation features and explicit object-relational modeling yield efficient, improved image captioning, enabling better relational understanding with a compact model.

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

### [76] [FoBa: A Foreground-Background co-Guided Method and New Benchmark for Remote Sensing Semantic Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15788)
*Haotian Zhang,Han Guo,Keyan Chen,Hao Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LevirSCD dataset and FoBa method with GIF module for semantic change detection; shows improvements in SeK metric across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCD suffers from limited granularity of change categories and underutilization of change information; need richer dataset and models that leverage both foreground context and bi-temporal interactions.

Method: Introduce LevirSCD benchmark (Beijing area, 16 change categories, 210 change types, fine-grained classes); propose FoBa: foreground-background co-guided SCD; introduces Gated Interaction Fusion (GIF) module and a simple consistency loss for bi-temporal interaction and spatial consistency.

Result: FoBa achieves competitive results vs SOTA, with SeK improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%, and 2.81% on SECOND, JL1, and LevirSCD datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The dataset and method address data and methodological gaps in SCD, improving detection performance; code and dataset released.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/zmoka-zht/FoBa.

### [77] [Minimal Semantic Sufficiency Meets Unsupervised Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15791)
*Tan Pan,Kaiyu Guo,Dongli Xu,Zhaorui Tan,Chen Jiang,Deshu Chen,Xin Guo,Brian C. Lovell,Limei Han,Yuan Cheng,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defines Unsupervised Domain Generalization as learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation that preserves shared semantics across augmented views while removing irrelevant variation; uses InfoNCE for sufficiency and a semantic–variation disentanglement plus reconstruction module for minimality, achieving state-of-the-art without domain/label supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lack of domain labels in real-world unsupervised learning and to separate semantic information from nuisance variations in UDG. The goal is to reduce out-of-distribution risk by learning representations that are semantically rich yet minimal.

Method: Introduce MS-UDG framework: (1) InfoNCE-based objective to ensure sufficiency of the semantic representation across augmented views; (2) two components to promote minimality: a semantic-variation disentanglement loss that separates semantic content from nuisance variation, and a reconstruction-based mechanism to capture and regularize adequate variation.

Result: Empirically achieves new state-of-the-art performance on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, outperforming existing SSL and UDG approaches without requiring category or domain labels during representation learning.

Conclusion: Formalizes UDG as learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation grounded in information theory; the combination of sufficiency and minimality objectives yields improved generalization in unsupervised settings and demonstrates practical effectiveness without labeled domain information.

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

### [78] [TASAM: Terrain-and-Aware Segment Anything Model for Temporal-Scale Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15795)
*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Hanzhang Chi,Qi Zhang,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASAM is a terrain- and time-aware extension of SAM for high-res remote sensing segmentation, adding three lightweight modules (terrain-aware adapter, temporal prompt generator, multi-scale fusion) that boost performance without retraining the SAM backbone, yielding strong gains on LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM is powerful for natural images but struggles with remote sensing challenges like complex terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal changes. A domain-adaptive augmentation of foundation models could improve geospatial segmentation without full retraining.

Method: Integrate three lightweight modules onto the SAM backbone without retraining: (1) terrain-aware adapter injecting elevation priors, (2) temporal prompt generator capturing land-cover changes over time, (3) multi-scale fusion to improve delineation across scales; minimal computational overhead.

Result: Significant performance gains on three remote sensing benchmarks (LoveDA, iSAID, WHU-CD) compared to zero-shot SAM and task-specific models, with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive augmentation of foundation models is valuable for robust geospatial segmentation, offering a scalable path toward improved remote sensing analysis without full-model retraining.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

### [79] [Boosting Active Learning with Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15805)
*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Xiaoying Liao,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple teacher-student uncertainty estimation approach for active learning (AL) that uses the output distance between a task-model teacher and a task-agnostic student to quantify uncertainty, enabling effective AL without special training tricks, validated on classical CV tasks and cryo-ET data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation in AL often relies on complex auxiliary models and training strategies, which are hard to train for domain-specific tasks like cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) classification. A simpler, robust method is needed that works with standard training paradigms.

Method: In each AL cycle, train a teacher (the AL task model) and a student (an auxiliary, task-agnostic model) simultaneously and measure uncertainty for unlabeled data via a distance between their outputs. The student is lightweight and does not depend on adversarial or other specialized training tricks. The approach connects data uncertainty to the upper bound of task loss rather than its concrete value.

Result: Extensive experiments on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges demonstrate the method’s efficacy and efficiency, indicating strong practical utility.

Conclusion: A knowledge-transfer based uncertainty estimation framework for AL, using teacher-student output-distance, provides robust uncertainty estimates without specialized training techniques and generalizes to challenging domains like cryo-ET.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

### [80] [Shedding Light on Depth: Explainability Assessment in Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15980)
*Lorenzo Cirillo,Claudio Schiavella,Lorenzo Papa,Paolo Russo,Irene Amerini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analyzes explainability methods for Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) across lightweight and deep models, introduces Attribution Fidelity to assess attribution reliability, and finds Saliency Maps best for lightweight METER while Integrated Gradients suit deep PixelFormer; Attribution Fidelity helps detect unreliable explanations beyond conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDE explainability is underexplored; there is a need for reliable visual explanations and robust evaluation metrics that align attributions with actual depth predictions to build trust in MDE systems.

Method: Evaluate Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on two MDE architectures (METER - lightweight, PixelFormer - deep). Perturb the most/least attributed pixels and observe changes in depth outputs. Introduce Attribution Fidelity as a metric to measure how consistently attributions reflect the predicted depth map.

Result: Saliency Maps effectively highlight important input features for the lightweight METER; Integrated Gradients perform well for the deep PixelFormer; Attribution Fidelity successfully flags unreliable explanations even when conventional metrics suggest satisfactory results.

Conclusion: Attribution Fidelity adds a valuable reliability check for visual explanations in MDE. Depending on model complexity, different attribution methods are preferable, and evaluation of explanations should include fidelity-based metrics beyond traditional metrics to ensure trustworthy interpretations.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

### [81] [LC-SLab -- An Object-based Deep Learning Framework for Large-scale Land Cover Classification from Satellite Imagery and Sparse In-situ Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15868)
*Johannes Leonhardt,Juergen Gall,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC-SLab is a deep learning framework for object-based land cover mapping under sparse supervision. It combines input-level aggregation via graph neural networks and output-level aggregation by postprocessing semantic segmentation outputs, and leverages features from a large pre-trained network. Evaluated on Sentinel-2 with sparse LUCAS labels, it balances accuracy and map coherence and is robust to dataset size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open in-situ land cover datasets offer scalable but spatially sparse supervision; pixel-wise DL maps tend to be fragmented. Object-based classification can enforce coherent mapping units (minimum mapping unit), but DL-based object-level methods for medium-resolution imagery with sparse supervision are underexplored. There is a need for frameworks that systematically study object-based DL approaches for large-scale land cover mapping.

Method: LC-SLab provides two aggregation pathways: (1) input-level aggregation using graph neural networks that operate on semantically coherent regions to impose a minimum mapping unit; (2) output-level aggregation by postprocessing predictions from established semantic segmentation models to create object-level maps. The framework also incorporates features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. It is evaluated on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, examining the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation and sensitivity to dataset size.

Result: Object-based methods in LC-SLab can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation is more robust on smaller datasets; output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several LC-SLab configurations outperform existing land cover products, demonstrating practical utility.

Conclusion: LC-SLab demonstrates the viability of systematic exploration of object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover mapping under sparse supervision. It offers a flexible framework that can adapt to data availability, balancing the robustness of input-level aggregation with the data efficiency of output-level aggregation, and motivates broader adoption of object-based DL approaches in real-world land cover mapping.

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

*Liwei Liao,Xufeng Li,Xiaoyun Zheng,Boning Liu,Feng Gao,Ronggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GVR, a zero-shot grounding framework that reformulates 3D visual grounding as 2D view retrieval for 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling zero-shot grounding without per-scene training or labeled data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Visual Grounding in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is hampered by implicit texture representations that force per-scene training and by the need for large labeled datasets; a data-efficient, training-free approach is desirable for real-world robotics tasks.

Method: Grounding via View Retrieval (GVR) reframes 3DVG as an object-level 2D view retrieval problem. By querying across multiple views, it aggregates grounding clues without requiring 3D annotations or per-scene training for 3DGS.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art visual grounding performance in zero-shot 3DVG and no need for per-scene training; video demos are available.

Conclusion: GVR establishes a solid zero-shot foundation for 3DVG research, reducing annotation and training burdens and enabling scalable grounding in 3D scenes.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Outperformed baselines VISTA3D and SAM-Med3D, matched SegVol, surpassing it in final DSC but trailing in other metrics. Coreset track: 5th of 10, best among no-pretrained-weight approaches. Ablations show relative positional encodings and Muon optimizer speed convergence and improve segmentation quality.

Conclusion: ENSAM demonstrates that a lightweight, promptable, data- and compute-efficient architecture with specialized training tricks can achieve competitive performance in multimodal 3D biomedical image segmentation, offering a viable path toward universal, accessible medical segmentation models.

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

*Paul Julius Kühn,Duc Anh Nguyen,Arjan Kuijper,Holger Graf,Dieter Fellner,Saptarshi Neil Sinha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A SAM2-based range-view framework is proposed for LiDAR 3D segmentation, adapting a visual foundation model to 3D via range-view projections and targeted encoder tweaks. It aims for fast, scalable 2D-centric pipelines with competitive performance on SemanticKITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational cost and irregular memory access of voxel/point-based LiDAR methods and leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation and Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for faster, more scalable 3D perception.

Method: Project LiDAR data to range view and use SAM2 as backbone with architectural tweaks: (1) a module focusing on horizontal dependencies in range images, (2) configuration tailored to spherical projections, (3) an encoder adapted to capture range-view discontinuities and spatial patterns, enabling efficient 2D feature extraction with projection/back-projection to 3D.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines; demonstrates viability of VFMs as backbones for 3D perception.

Conclusion: Range-view segmentation using VFMs like SAM2 is viable for LiDAR perception, offering a unified, foundation-model-driven path for 3D segmentation with potential for real-time, scalable deployment.

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

*Pengteng Li,Pinhao Song,Wuyang Li,Weiyu Guo,Huizai Yao,Yijie Xu,Dugang Liu,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free prompting framework SEE&TREK improves spatial understanding of multimodal LLMs under vision-only constraints by generating semantically rich keyframes and motion-aware prompts; it uses Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling and motion reconstruction, requires no training or GPUs, and yields up to about 3.5% gains on VSI-Bench and STI-Bench across various MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely visual-spatial understanding in multimodal LLMs remains underexplored, especially without additional modalities (e.g., depth, point clouds) or training. SEE&TREK targets training-free enhancement to bridge this gap and enable stronger spatial reasoning in vision-only settings.

Method: Two core principles: (1) visual diversity via Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling to extract semantically rich keyframes capturing scene structure using an off-the-shell perception model; (2) motion reconstruction by simulating visual trajectories and encoding relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve spatial relations and temporal coherence. The approach is training- and GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be integrated into existing MLLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on VSI-Bench and STI-Bench show SEE&TREK consistently improves various MLLMs on diverse spatial reasoning tasks, with the most notable gain around +3.5%.

Conclusion: SEE&TREK offers a practical, training-free pathway to stronger spatial intelligence in vision-only multimodal LLMs, enabling easy integration and broad performance gains without additional training or hardware.

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

TL;DR: GREAT-Stereo integrates three attention modules (Spatial, Matching, Volume) into iterative stereo methods to inject global context and geometric details, improving performance in ill-posed regions; achieves state-of-the-art on several benchmarks for IGEV-Stereo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ill-posed stereo regions (occlusions, textureless areas, repetitive patterns) suffer from lack of global context; need to inject global context and geometric information into iterative refinement.

Method: Propose Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT) with Spatial Attention (SA), Matching Attention (MA), and Volume Attention (VA). These modules capture global context along spatial and epipolar dimensions and refine the cost-volume, then plug into existing iterative stereo methods (e.g., RAFT-Stereo, IGEV-Stereo).

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework's universality and effectiveness; GREAT-IGEV ranks first on Scene Flow, KITTI 2015, ETH3D leaderboards and second on Middlebury; code released.

Conclusion: GREAT-Stereo provides a universal, robust enhancement for iterative stereo by injecting global context and geometric cues via attention; the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks and can be flexibly plugged into existing methods.

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

*David Calhas,Arlindo L. Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DFMs fuse bottom-up input with evolving high-level representations using differential-equation dynamics solved by an RNN with exponential decay, yielding robust, data-efficient performance in vision and medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mimic iterative, biologically-inspired decision-making and overcome static feedforward limitations by incorporating feedback that stabilizes learning and improves generalization under noise and limited data.

Method: Model dynamics as a differential equation solved by an RNN, stabilized by exponential decay to ensure convergence; evaluate on object recognition and segmentation tasks under varying noise and data regimes, and transferability to medical imaging; compare to feedforward baselines; release code.

Result: DFMs outperform feedforward models in robustness to noise and data scarcity across vision tasks; show strong performance in medical imaging; robust across noise types.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven, stable dynamics are important for robust, generalizable learning; DFMs offer a promising approach with accessible code.

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

### [88] [Sparse Multiview Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15924)
*Olivier Moliner,Viktor Larsson,Kalle Åström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, open-vocabulary 3D object detection method for sparse-view data that uses pre-trained 2D foundation models to lift 2D detections into 3D proposals and enforce cross-view feature consistency, achieving competitive results in dense settings and strong gains in sparse views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend 3D object detection beyond fixed category sets while reducing 3D training complexity, motivated by data scarcity in 3D and the abundance of 2D pre-trained models.

Method: A training-free pipeline that relies on off-the-shelf 2D foundation models to generate detections. It lifts 2D detections into 3D proposals and optimizes them to ensure feature-metric consistency across sparse multiple views without 3D-specific learning or expensive 3D feature fusion.

Result: The approach establishes a strong baseline, competitive with state-of-the-art in densely sampled scenarios and markedly outperforming them in sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: A simple, data-efficient pipeline leveraging 2D pre-trained models can enable open-vocabulary 3D detection in sparse-view conditions, offering practical advantages without heavy 3D training.

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

*Het Patel,Muzammil Allie,Qian Zhang,Jia Chen,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A non-retraining, plug-and-play tensor-decomposition defense for pre-trained vision-language models that filters adversarial noise in the vision encoder to improve robustness with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and many defenses require costly retraining or architecture changes. A lightweight, model-agnostic defense is desirable.

Method: Apply Tensor Train decomposition to vision encoder representations to decompose and reconstruct features, effectively filtering adversarial noise. Use low rank (8–32) and low residual strength (alpha ≈ 0.1–0.2). No retraining; compatible with pre-trained VLMs like CLIP.

Result: On Flickr30K, Recall@1 rises from 7.5% to 19.8% (12.3 percentage points restored). On COCO, from 3.8% to 11.9% (8.1 percentage points restored). Analysis indicates Tensor Train with low rank and low alpha is optimal.

Conclusion: Tensor Train-based decomposition offers a practical, plug-and-play defense with minimal overhead for existing VLMs, improving robustness against adversarial noise.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

TL;DR: A camera-radar BEV 3D detector with radar-first feature extraction and fast backbone achieves state-of-the-art NDS and fastest nuScenes inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robust 3D detection under adverse weather/lighting by leveraging radar's distant and speed information, addressing the scarcity of camera-radar fusion architectures.

Method: Introduce a radar-to-embedding backbone for radar pillars, employ self-attention to model radar point dependencies, and replace FPN-based convolutions with a lightweight conv to accelerate inference; fuse camera and radar features in BEV for detection head.

Result: Achieves 58.2 NDS with ResNet-50 on nuScenes and sets a new inference-time benchmark for this task.

Conclusion: Radar-first fusion with a compact backbone is effective for fast, accurate BEV 3D detection, establishing a strong baseline for camera-radar fusion.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate exhaustive search bottleneck in Otsu’s method to enable real-time image segmentation without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.

Method: Exploit unimodality of between-class variance; use binary search (bisection) to locate optimal threshold, yielding logarithmic evaluations; provide convergence guarantees.

Result: On 48 images, 91.63% fewer variance computations and 97.21% fewer iterations; exact matches in 66.67% of cases; 95.83% within 5 gray levels; universal convergence within logarithmic bounds.

Conclusion: The approach preserves Otsu’s foundations and segmentation quality while delivering deterministic, real-time capable performance; effective for large-scale processing.

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

TL;DR: Introduces MTMS-YieldNet for precise yield prediction by fusing multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data; achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across Sentinel-1, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 using contrastive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change complicates yield prediction due to weather, soil, and management changes; current models struggle with multi-spectral data; need integrated spatio-temporal, spectral analysis and tailored pre-training.

Method: Proposes MTMS-YieldNet, a network that fuses spectral data with spatio-temporal information; uses contrastive learning during pre-training to capture spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies in remote sensing data.

Result: Outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods; achieves MAPE of 0.336 (Sentinel-1), 0.353 (Landsat-8), and 0.331 (Sentinel-2). Demonstrates robust performance across climate/seasonal variations.

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet enhances yield prediction accuracy and offers actionable insights for farmers, potentially improving crop yields.

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage complementary modalities to improve diagnostic performance. Traditional fusion methods often treat modalities symmetrically and may not efficiently separate common patterns from modality-specific signals; an asymmetric, disentangled approach could enhance robustness and interpretability for clinical use.

Method: Proposes an asymmetric fusion framework that starts from a primary modality and integrates secondary modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific representations. Applied to a dataset of 239 patients with echocardiographic time series and tabular records, with comparative evaluation against existing methods (details not provided in the abstract).

Result: Outperforms existing methods and achieves an AUC over 90% on the validation/test set, indicating strong diagnostic performance and establishing a new performance benchmark for this task.

Conclusion: Shows promise for clinical deployment of multimodal, disentangled, asymmetric fusion. External validation on larger, diverse cohorts and clarity on baselines and statistical significance are needed to confirm generalizability and clinical utility.

Abstract: Multimodal data fusion is a key approach for enhancing diagnosis in medical
applications. We propose an asymmetric fusion strategy starting from a primary
modality and integrating secondary modalities by disentangling shared and

*Xiwei Liu,Yulong Li,Yichen Li,Xinlin Zhuang,Haolin Yang,Huifa Li,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuproCL replaces a single semantic target with multiple context-aware prototypes to tackle semantic ambiguity and intra-class diversity in language-guided continual learning, using an LLM agent for disambiguation and visual-modal expansion and a LogSumExp aggregation for adaptive prototype alignment, yielding consistent gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-prototype targets in language-guided visual continual learning suffer from semantic ambiguity (polysemous category names) and inadequate coverage of intra-class visual diversity. A robust, multi-prototype approach guided by language and adaptable aggregation can improve representation and transfer across tasks.

Method: A lightweight LLM agent performs category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a set of semantic prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism enables the vision model to selectively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image during inference. The framework is evaluated across multiple continual learning baselines.

Result: Experiments across various CL baselines show that MuproCL consistently improves performance and robustness, outperforming single-prototype approaches and enhancing resilience to distribution shifts in continual settings.

Conclusion: Replacing a single semantic target with multiple context-aware prototypes via language-guided supervision strengthens continual learning, offering a more effective path for leveraging pretrained language models in vision tasks.

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

*Meng Yang,Fan Fan,Zizhuo Li,Songchu Deng,Yong Ma,Jiayi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DistillMatch distills semantic features from Vision Foundation Models into a lightweight multimodal image-matching student model, injects modality-specific cues, and uses V2I-GAN for data augmentation, achieving superior cross-modal matching performance on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal image matching suffers from large appearance gaps and scarce high-quality annotated data; leveraging generalizable representations from Vision Foundation Models can improve robustness and adaptability.

Method: Train a lightweight student using knowledge distillation from VFM (e.g., DINOv2/DINOv3) to extract high-level semantic features for cross-modal matching; inject modality category information into the opposite modality's features to retain modality-specific cues; introduce V2I-GAN to translate visible images to pseudo-infrared for augmented training data.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows DistillMatch outperforms existing methods on public multimodal matching datasets.

Conclusion: DistillMatch demonstrates that distilling from VFMs and modality-aware feature integration, combined with cross-modality data augmentation, yields improved cross-modal matching generalization and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

*Xihong Yang,Siwei Wang,Jiaqi Jin,Fangdi Wang,Tianrui Liu,Yueming Jin,Xinwang Liu,En Zhu,Kunlun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CauMVCs causal-learning framework for multi-view clustering under partial alignment; treats partial data as an intervention, learns invariant features with a VAE, performs post-intervention inference with a decoder, and uses a contrastive regularizer, achieving strong generalization across fully and partially aligned data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVC methods heavily rely on pre-aligned, consistent view correspondences. In real-world settings, data are often only partially aligned, causing performance degradation when alignment shifts occur. There is a need for a generalized MVC approach robust to alignment inconsistencies.

Method: Propose CauMVC: a causal multi-view clustering network. Model partially aligned data as an intervention and framing MVC with partially aligned data as post-intervention inference. Use a Variational Auto-Encoder to learn invariant features by leveraging existing information, with an encoder for invariant features and a decoder for post-intervention inference. Include a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations across views.

Result: Empirical experiments on both fully aligned and partially aligned data show strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC, outperforming baselines by being robust to alignment shifts.

Conclusion: This work is the first to address generalized multi-view clustering through causal learning, demonstrating robust performance across varying degrees of data alignment.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

### [97] [GLip: A Global-Local Integrated Progressive Framework for Robust Visual Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16031)
*Tianyue Wang,Shuang Yang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLip is a two-stage, global-local integrated framework for robust visual speech recognition (lip reading). It first learns coarse alignment between visual features (global and local) and speech units, then refines with a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) that fuses local cues with global context, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRS2/LRS3 and a new Mandarin dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VSR performance degrades under real-world visual challenges (illumination changes, occlusions, blur, pose variation). Existing methods largely ignore these challenges and rely on global features. A coarse-to-fine, global-local strategy could leverage discriminative local cues and robust alignments to improve robustness.

Method: A dual-path feature extractor processes global and local visual features. Stage 1 learns coarse alignment with acoustic speech units using audio-visual data to establish a robust foundation. Stage 2 introduces a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) that dynamically integrates local features with relevant global context across spatial and temporal dimensions to refine representations into precise visual-speech mappings.

Result: GLip demonstrates enhanced robustness to visual challenges and consistently outperforms existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. Its effectiveness is further validated on a newly introduced Mandarin dataset.

Conclusion: Progressively exploiting discriminative local regions, via a global-local integrated  two-stage learning framework and CEM, yields more precise visual-speech mappings and improved robustness for VSR in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

*Stuti Pathak,Rhys G. Evans,Gunther Steenackers,Rudi Penne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dictionary-guided Graph ConvNet that predicts both the number and locations of B-spline control points to reconstruct smooth surfaces from noisy point clouds without normals, surpassing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy, real-world point clouds and reliance on ground-truth or estimated normals hinder robust data-driven surface reconstruction; existing spline methods have fixed complexity and can't adapt to underlying surface detail.

Method: A Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network predicts both the count and positions of B-spline control points, enabling adaptive surface complexity and smooth reconstructions without requiring point normals; surfaces are represented via B-splines and evaluated against standard baselines.

Result: The proposed method outperforms all baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively on widely-used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The approach yields robust, smooth surface reconstructions from noisy point clouds without normals, with adaptive spline complexity driven by learned control points.

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIR-GAD augments a Multimodal LLM with activity-level and group-specific tokens to perform group activity detection via language-instructed reasoning and multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GAD methods rely on implicit visual patterns and lack contextual reasoning and explainability; leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with explicit semantic tokens can inject commonsense knowledge and improve context-aware activity understanding.

Method: Introduce an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens to expand the MLLM vocabulary. Process video frames with language instructions and the tokens, and integrate them into the MLLM. Apply a multi-label classification loss to train the <ACT> token for discriminative semantics. Propose a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module to fuse MLLM embeddings with visual features for enhanced GAD performance.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate superior performance of LIR-GAD over existing methods on GAD tasks.

Conclusion: The work shows that language-instructed reasoning with token-based multimodal fusion can improve group activity detection, offering better semantic representation and potential for enhanced explainability.

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

### [100] [Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion for Self-supervised Real-World Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16091)
*Shen Cheng,Haipeng Li,Haibin Huang,Xiaohong Liu,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch, self-supervised diffusion framework that fuses blind-spot networks with conventional diffusion to denoise real-world images, achieving state-of-the-art results on SIDD/DND without paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind-spot networks (BSNs) often sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial independence; diffusion models are difficult to adapt to self-supervised denoising. A method is needed to leverage BSN benefits while modeling noise in a self-supervised setting for real-world denoising.

Method: Propose Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion (BSGD): a two-branch diffusion architecture: (1) a BSN-based branch that generates semi-clean guidance, and (2) a conventional diffusion branch that captures the underlying noise distribution. Training uses the BSN-guided sampling to steer the diffusion process, enabling self-supervised learning without paired data.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on real-world denoising benchmarks (SIDD and DND) with extensive experiments, establishing a strong self-supervised solution. Code and pretrained models are released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: BSGD provides an effective self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising by integrating BSN guidance with diffusion modeling, mitigating BSN drawbacks while accurately capturing noise and preserving details.

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models
are released at: https://github.com/Sumching/BSGD.

*Yi Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaSports-Traj introduces a role- and domain-aware adapter and a hierarchical contrastive objective to adapt trajectory models across player/ball roles and sports domains, improving cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to address structural heterogeneity across agent roles and distribution gaps across sports domains, which existing unified models struggle with.

Method: Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to condition latent representations on agent identity and domain context; Hierarchical Contrastive Learning separating role-sensitive and domain-aware representations to disentangle latent structure.

Result: demonstrated strong performance on Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U in unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction tasks.

Conclusion: adaptive architecture effectively handles intra- and inter-domain distribution discrepancies, enabling better generalization for multi-agent sports trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

### [102] [SegDINO3D: 3D Instance Segmentation Empowered by Both Image-Level and Object-Level 2D Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16098)
*Jinyuan Qu,Hongyang Li,Xingyu Chen,Shilong Liu,Yukai Shi,Tianhe Ren,Ruitao Jing,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegDINO3D introduces a Transformer encoder-decoder for 3D instance segmentation that leverages 2D pre-trained detection features (image-level and object-level) to enhance 3D representations. It enriches 3D points with 2D features and uses 3D box queries to guide cross-attention with compact 2D object queries, achieving state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 and notably large gains on ScanNet200.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data is relatively scarce compared to 2D, limiting 3D model performance. By transferring knowledge from a pre-trained 2D detector, SegDINO3D aims to boost 3D instance segmentation by leveraging rich 2D representations at both image and object levels, while maintaining efficiency by compressing 2D features into 2D object queries.

Method: A Transformer encoder-decoder that (1) enriches each 3D point with 2D image features from multiple views and fuses 3D context in an encoder; (2) forms 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes in the decoder and uses cross-attention to 2D object queries derived from a pre-trained 2D detector; (3) uses 3D box queries to modulate cross-attention, enabling precise querying; and (4) avoids storing large 2D feature maps by representing 2D information via compact object queries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation on ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200. On ScanNet200, it significantly outperforms prior methods with +8.7 mAP on the validation set and +6.8 mAP on the hidden test set.

Conclusion: SegDINO3D demonstrates that incorporating 2D pre-trained knowledge into a 3D Transformer framework yields substantial gains in 3D instance segmentation, especially on challenging datasets like ScanNet200, validating the effectiveness of cross-modal feature reuse and compact 2D object representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

### [103] [RadarGaussianDet3D: An Efficient and Effective Gaussian-based 3D Detector with 4D Automotive Radars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16119)
*Weiyi Xiong,Bing Zhu,Tao Huang,Zewei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian-based Radar detector for 4D radar that densifies BEV features with Point Gaussian Encoder and 3D Gaussian Splatting, uses Box Gaussian Loss for coherent optimization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely on pillar encoders producing sparse BEV features, optimize bounding boxes independently, and have limited on-vehicle real-time speed; need denser representations and loss that couples box attributes for better accuracy and efficiency on embedded devices.

Method: Introduce RadarGaussianDet3D with Gaussian primitives/distributions. Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) converts each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) used for BEV rasterization to produce dense feature maps. Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) converts bounding boxes to 3D Gaussian distributions and measures distance to jointly optimize bbox attributes.

Result: On TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft datasets, achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with substantially faster inference than prior 4D radar detectors, showing potential for real-time deployment on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: Gaussian primitives and loss enable denser BEV representations and more coherent optimization, improving accuracy while meeting real-time efficiency requirements for automotive radar-based 3D detection.

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

*Yi-Fan Zhang,Haihua Yang,Huanyu Zhang,Yang Shi,Zezhou Chen,Haochen Tian,Chaoyou Fu,Haotian Wang,Kai Wu,Bo Cui,Xu Wang,Jianfei Pan,Haotian Wang,Zhang Zhang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents a comprehensive, empirically-backed recipe for building high-performance multimodal reward models, introducing BaseReward as a strong, efficient baseline built on Qwen2.5-VL and validated on multiple benchmarks and in real RL pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning multimodal LLMs with human preferences is crucial but lacks systematic guidance. The paper surveys key components (paradigms, head architectures, training strategies, data, backbone, scaling, ensembles) to establish a practical development recipe and a competitive baseline.

Method: Extensive ablation across reward-modeling paradigms (Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, Generative RM), reward head architectures, training strategies, data curation from 10+ multimodal/text-only preference datasets, backbone choice and scale, and ensembling. Proposes BaseReward with a two-layer reward head on a Qwen2.5-VL backbone, trained on curated high-quality multimodal/text-only preference data.

Result: BaseReward achieves new state-of-the-art on major benchmarks (MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, Multimodal Reward Bench). It also improves real-world MLLM performance when integrated into an RL pipeline across perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks.

Conclusion: The work offers not just a top-tier MRM but a practical, empirically-backed guide for constructing robust MRMs for next-generation MLLMs, potentially accelerating both research and industrial deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

*Carter Sifferman,Yiquan Li,Yiming Li,Fangzhou Mu,Michael Gleicher,Mohit Gupta,Yin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recover 3D geometry from very sparse time-of-flight data using a hybrid feed-forward + differentiable rendering approach; demonstrates pose estimation of a known untextured object from as few as ~15 pixels and outlines limits with hardware prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage rich time-resolved ToF counts from low-cost, high-FOV sensors to enable geometry recovery with extremely sparse measurements, exploiting strong priors on parametric scenes.

Method: Use a two-stage pipeline: (1) feed-forward prediction to estimate scene parameters (e.g., 6D pose) from TOF data; (2) differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis loop to refine the parameters, plus hardware prototypes and both simulated and controlled real-world experiments.

Result: Showed effective pose recovery for a known untextured 3D model in simulations and controlled captures; presented initial positive results for other parametric scenes and explored the imaging system's limits.

Conclusion: Feasibility demonstrated for geometry recovery from sparse TOF measurements using strong priors; method combines fast inference and differentiable refinement; hardware prototypes validate practicality and point to further work on broader parametric scenes.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

*Vatsal Malaviya,Agneet Chatterjee,Maitreya Patel,Yezhou Yang,Chitta Baral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces AcT2I benchmark for action-centric text-to-image generation, shows current models struggle with action-focused prompts, and presents a training-free LLM-based prompt augmentation (including temporal details) that substantially improves image accuracy (up to 72%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in evaluating T2I models on complex, action-centered scenes and the suspected inadequacy of training data to capture nuanced attributes and dependencies.

Method: 1) Propose AcT2I benchmark for action-centric prompts. 2) Benchmark leading T2I models on AcT2I. 3) Develop a training-free knowledge distillation approach using Large Language Models to augment prompts with dense information across three dimensions, especially temporal details. 4) Evaluate impact on image generation accuracy.

Result: Leading T2I models exhibit poor performance on AcT2I. Prompt augmentation with dense linguistic information, particularly temporal details, significantly improves generation accuracy, with the best model achieving ~72% improvement.

Conclusion: Current T2I systems struggle with scenes requiring complex reasoning and action understanding. Systematically enriching prompts with linguistic knowledge, especially temporal context, can markedly enhance image fidelity. This points to a promising direction combining prompt engineering with knowledge distillation to improve action-centric image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

*Renjie Pi,Kehao Miao,Li Peihang,Runtao Liu,Jiahui Gao,Jipeng Zhang,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs show heightened sycophantic behavior when processing images; authors propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT) to curb this without inducing stubbornness, by enabling reflective reasoning to distinguish misleading from corrective instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and mitigate the intensified visual sycophantic behavior ('sycophantic modality gap') in multimodal LLMs to improve reliability and alignment when handling image inputs.

Method: Analyze factors contributing to the gap, try naive supervised fine-tuning to reduce susceptibility to misleading prompts, observe its drawback (overly resistant to corrections), then introduce Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT) that prompts reflective reasoning to decide whether an instruction is misleading or corrective before answering.

Result: Naive fine-tuning reduces susceptibility to misleading prompts but increases stubbornness to corrections; SRT significantly reduces sycophantic responses to misleading prompts without causing excessive stubbornness to corrective prompts.

Conclusion: SRT effectively mitigates visual sycophancy in MLLMs by incorporating reflective reasoning, offering a path toward more reliable image-grounded AI behavior and highlighting the value of intentional reasoning steps in alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

*Xiaoqi Zhao,Youwei Pang,Chenyang Yu,Lihe Zhang,Huchuan Lu,Shijian Lu,Georges El Fakhri,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal segmentation framework (UniMRSeg) with hierarchical self-supervised compensation robustly handles missing/corrupted modalities, outperforming state-of-the-art across MRI brain tumor, RGB-D semantic, and RGB-D/T salient object segmentation; code forthcoming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying multi-modal segmentation in real-world settings is hindered by incomplete or corrupted modalities and the high cost of maintaining numerous per-modality/subset models; a unified approach is desired.

Method: UniMRSeg introduces hierarchical bridging across input, feature, and output levels. It uses (1) modality reconstruction with hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation to learn intrinsic modality traits and enable cross-modal generation for missing data; (2) modality-invariant contrastive learning to reduce feature-space distance for incomplete–complete modality pairs; (3) a lightweight reverse attention adapter to compensate for weak semantics in the frozen encoder; (4) fine-tuning under a hybrid consistency constraint to maintain stable predictions across all modality combinations.

Result: Empirically, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios across MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, and RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

Conclusion: UniMRSeg offers a deployment-friendly, robust solution to modality gaps in multi-modal segmentation by bridging representations at multiple levels, with improved stability and performance without requiring multiple specialized models; code release is planned.

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

TL;DR: Manzano is a scalable unified multimodal framework that combines a hybrid image tokenizer with a shared vision encoder and two adapters to jointly support image understanding and generation, guided by a unified LLM and a diffusion decoder; it achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models and competitive performance with specialist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome performance trade-offs in open-source unified multimodal models between understanding and generation, and to enable scalable joint learning through a simple, unified architecture and training recipe.

Method: Architecture includes a single shared vision encoder feeding two lightweight adapters that output continuous embeddings (for image-to-text understanding) and discrete tokens (for text-to-image generation) in a shared semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts text and image tokens; a diffusion decoder converts image tokens to pixels. Training uses a unified recipe over both understanding and generation data to facilitate joint learning at scale.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluations. Shows minimal task conflicts and consistent performance gains with larger model sizes, validating the hybrid tokenizer design.

Conclusion: Hybrid tokenization coupled with a unified training strategy enables scalable joint learning of understanding and generation, delivering strong unified-modal performance and close-to-specialist capabilities, especially in text-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

### [110] [Efficient Heuristic Algorithms for Interleaving Distance between Merge Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15687)
*Elena Farahbakhsh Touli,Talha Bin Masood*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Polynomial-time heuristic methods to approximate interleaving distance for labeled merge trees with partial label agreement, addressing unlabeled or disjoint-label cases; demonstrated on simulations of time-varying electron density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interleaving distance is a central metric for comparing merge trees in topological data analysis. Exact computation is feasible only in restricted settings (e.g., labeled trees with overlapping labels); there is a need for practical approximations when labels are missing or disjoint to enable analysis of real-world data.

Method: Proposes a novel heuristic that primarily assigns labels to leaves to infer structural correspondence between trees. Also presents an enhanced version of an earlier algorithm with improved performance. Both run in polynomial time and are designed to handle unlabeled or structurally diverse data.

Result: The methods provide practical, efficient polynomial-time tools for comparing merge trees with partial or no label alignment and are demonstrated on simulations of time-varying electron density.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction for merge-tree analysis by offering practical, scalable algorithms for unlabeled or variably labeled data, with potential impact on visualization and scientific computing applications.

Abstract: Merge trees are fundamental structures in topological data analysis.
Interleaving distance is a widely accepted metric for comparing merge trees,
with applications in visualization and scientific computing. While a greedy
algorithm exists for finding the interleaving distance between labeled merge
trees with overlapping labels, computing the interleaving distance between
unlabeled trees or labeled trees with disjoint labels remains a significant
challenge.
  In this work, we introduce a novel heuristic algorithm for approximating the
interleaving distance between labeled merge trees with partial agreement and
disagreement. Our method strategically assigns labels primarily to the leaves
of the trees to infer structural correspondence. We also introduce an enhanced
version of a previous algorithm that offers improved performance. Both
algorithms run in polynomial time and provide practical, efficient alternatives
for comparing merge trees, particularly in cases involving unlabeled or
structurally diverse data. This work contributes a new direction for merge tree
analysis and offers promising tools for real-world applications. We demonstrate
this application on the simulation of time-varying electron density.

TL;DR: Three variants of the MaxRS problem are analyzed—Dynamic MaxRS, Batched MaxRS, and Colored MaxRS—providing new algorithms and bounds: a first dynamic MaxRS update algorithm with near-halving guarantees; tight-ish bounds for batched 1D; and efficient color-aware approximations (1/2−ε in general, and 1−ε in 2D) for balls, with high-probability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MaxRS is a canonical geometric optimization problem with broad relevance in facility placement, data collections, and monitoring. The paper studies realistic settings (dynamic updates, batched requests, and color constraints) where classic static solutions are insufficient, and aims to close gaps with efficient randomized and exact-output-sensitive methods.

Method: 1) Dynamic MaxRS: randomized (1/2−ε)-approximation with update time Oε(log n). 2) Batched MaxRS: in 1D, conditional lower bound Ω(mn) via min-plus convolution hardness; thus the trivial O(mn log n) in 2D is near-tight; similar bound for batched smallest k-enclosing interval. 3) Colored MaxRS: (a) d-balls: randomized (1/2−ε)-approx in Oε(n log n); (b) 2D: (1−ε)-approx in expected Oε(n log n). All results hold with high probability.

Result: Dynamic MaxRS achieves a first known dynamic update algorithm with Oε(log n) time per update and a 1/2−ε approximation. Batched MaxRS in 1D has a conditional lower bound Ω(mn), showing the mn log n upper bound in higher dimensions is essentially tight; same scale applies to batched smallest k-enclosing interval. Colored MaxRS yields fast (1/2−ε)-approx for d-balls with n log n time and, in 2D, a near-optimal (1−ε)-approximation in expected n log n time.

Conclusion: Two core techniques drive the results: (i) a volume-based randomized game to obtain 1/2−ε approximations; (ii) an exact output-sensitive algorithm accelerated by color sampling to achieve near-optimal (1−ε) approximations. The work delivers the first dynamic MaxRS result, tight-ish bounds for batched versions, and efficient color-aware approximations in higher dimensions, suggesting directions for tightening lower bounds and extending techniques to other shapes.

Abstract: We revisit the maximum range sum (MaxRS) problem: given a set $P$ of $n$
weighted points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a range $Q$ (typically axis-aligned
$d$-box or $d$-ball), the goal is to place $Q$ to maximize the total weight of
points in $P\cap Q$. We study three natural variations:
  (1) Dynamic MaxRS: The goal is to update the placement of a $d$-ball under
point insertions and deletions. We give a randomized
$(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation with update time $O_\epsilon(\log n)$.
The approximation factor holds with high probability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result on dynamic MaxRS.
  (2) Batched MaxRS: In $\mathbb{R}^1$, along with $P$ we are given $m$
intervals of varying lengths. We prove a conditional lower bound of
$\Omega(mn)$ time (via conjectured $(\min,+)$-convolution hardness), showing
the trivial $O(mn\log n)$ upper bound in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is essentially tight.
We also establish a similar bound for a related problem of batched smallest
$k$-enclosing interval.
  (3) Colored MaxRS: Each point has a color from $[m]$, and the goal is to
place $Q$ to maximize the number of uniquely colored points in $P\cap Q$. Prior
work only considered axis-aligned rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For $d$-balls,
we give: (a) a randomized $(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximation in
$O_\epsilon(n\log n)$ time (avoiding exponential dependence on $d$), and (b) in
$\mathbb{R}^2$, a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in expected $O_\epsilon(n\log
n)$ time. Both approximations hold with high probability.
  Our algorithms rely on two techniques of broader interest. The first yields
$(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)$-approximations via a volume argument on $d$-balls and
a randomized game. The second achieves $(1-\epsilon)$-approximations through an
exact output-sensitive algorithm, which we speed up by random sampling on
colors.

### [112] [DIPP: Discriminative Impact Point Predictor for Catching Diverse In-Flight Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15254)
*Ngoc Huy Nguyen,Kazuki Shibata,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP) for in-flight object catching with a quadruped robot, backed by a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects. DIPP comprises a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) for early discrimination and an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) with two variants: Neural Acceleration Estimator (NAE) and Direct Point Estimator (DPE). It outperforms baselines on 15 seen and 5 unseen objects, improves early-stage prediction, enhances catching in simulation, and is validated by real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work targets two core challenges: (1) the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under unsteady aerodynamics for robust training, and (2) the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when trajectories are similar across objects. Creating a diverse dataset and a discriminative predictor aims to enable reliable, early impact point estimation for in-flight object catching.

Method: 1) Build a real-world dataset with 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects to capture complex aerodynamics. 2) Propose DIPP, consisting of (i) DFE to separate trajectories by dynamics for early discrimination and generalization, and (ii) IPP to estimate the impact point from these features. 2a) Implement NAE-based IPP that learns trajectories and derives impact points. 2b) Implement DPE-based IPP that directly outputs the impact point. 

Result: The dataset is more diverse and complex than existing ones. The DIPP method outperforms baselines on both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Early-stage predictions improve catching success in simulation, and real-world experiments validate effectiveness. The demonstration is available online.

Conclusion: The approach advances in-flight object catching under complex aerodynamics by coupling a discriminative feature embedding with two IPP strategies, validated on a sizable real-world dataset and demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments.

Abstract: In this study, we address the problem of in-flight object catching using a
quadruped robot with a basket. Our objective is to accurately predict the
impact point, defined as the object's landing position. This task poses two key
challenges: the absence of public datasets capturing diverse objects under
unsteady aerodynamics, which are essential for training reliable predictors;
and the difficulty of accurate early-stage impact point prediction when
trajectories appear similar across objects. To overcome these issues, we
construct a real-world dataset of 8,000 trajectories from 20 objects, providing
a foundation for advancing in-flight object catching under complex
aerodynamics. We then propose the Discriminative Impact Point Predictor (DIPP),
consisting of two modules: (i) a Discriminative Feature Embedding (DFE) that
separates trajectories by dynamics to enable early-stage discrimination and
generalization, and (ii) an Impact Point Predictor (IPP) that estimates the
impact point from these features. Two IPP variants are implemented: an Neural
Acceleration Estimator (NAE)-based method that predicts trajectories and
derives the impact point, and a Direct Point Estimator (DPE)-based method that
directly outputs it. Experimental results show that our dataset is more diverse
and complex than existing dataset, and that our method outperforms baselines on
both 15 seen and 5 unseen objects. Furthermore, we show that improved
early-stage prediction enhances catching success in simulation and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through real-world experiments. The

### [113] [GiAnt: A Bio-Inspired Hexapod for Adaptive Terrain Navigation and Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15264)
*Aasfee Mosharraf Bhuiyan,Md Luban Mehda,Md. Thawhid Hasan Puspo,Jubayer Amin Pritom*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An affordable, ant-inspired hexapod (GiAnt) demonstrates terrain-adaptive locomotion and simple control for research-use; features a lightweight 3D-printed/laser-cut 6-legged body, single-DOF legs, Arduino control, gait-based actuation, and onboard ML/image processing for 81-object live recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ants exhibit natural adaptability to diverse terrains with efficient energy use, suggesting a promising model for outdoor, terrain-robust robotics. The paper targets accessible, research-friendly hexapod platforms for exploration and surveying.

Method: Design and fabricate GiAnt (weight 1.75 kg; 310x200x120 mm) using 3D-printed and laser-cut parts. Implement a single-DOF leg mechanism (link and crank) and control via Arduino with gait-analysis for leg actuation. Integrate machine learning and image processing for live object recognition (81 classes). Test on grass, rocks, and steep surfaces to evaluate terrain adaptability and height capacity (up to 8 cm).

Result: GiAnt achieves movement on challenging terrains, demonstrates a height capability of about 8 cm, and provides live object recognition of 81 items. The design emphasizes low cost, modular fabrication, and simple control, highlighting practical suitability for research, exploration, and surveying.

Conclusion: The work represents a meaningful step toward accessible hexapod robots, trading mechanical complexity for control simplicity and manufacturability, while delivering terrain flexibility and basic autonomous/assisted sensing capabilities appropriate for field use.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development and testing of GiAnt, an
affordable hexapod which is inspired by the efficient motions of ants. The
decision to model GiAnt after ants rather than other insects is rooted in ants'
natural adaptability to a variety of terrains. This bio-inspired approach gives
it a significant advantage in outdoor applications, offering terrain
flexibility along with efficient energy use. It features a lightweight
3D-printed and laser cut structure weighing 1.75 kg with dimensions of 310 mm x
200 mm x 120 mm. Its legs have been designed with a simple Single Degree of
Freedom (DOF) using a link and crank mechanism. It is great for conquering
challenging terrains such as grass, rocks, and steep surfaces. Unlike
traditional robots using four wheels for motion, its legged design gives
superior adaptability to uneven and rough surfaces. GiAnt's control system is
built on Arduino, allowing manual operation. An effective way of controlling
the legs of GiAnt was achieved by gait analysis. It can move up to 8 cm of
height easily with its advanced leg positioning system. Furthermore, equipped
with machine learning and image processing technology, it can identify 81
different objects in a live monitoring system. It represents a significant step
towards creating accessible hexapod robots for research, exploration, and
surveying, offering unique advantages in adaptability and control simplicity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Embodied Arena offers a comprehensive, evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI, unifying taxonomy, benchmarks, data generation, and leaderboards to drive progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three core bottlenecks: lack of a systematic capability understanding, absence of unified evaluation across benchmarks, and underdeveloped scalable data acquisition for embodied tasks.

Method: Create a taxonomy with three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, 25 dimensions; unify 22 benchmarks across 3 domains; integrate 30+ models; deploy LLM-driven automated data generation; run real-time leaderboards with two views; derive nine findings.

Result: A unified, scalable evaluation infrastructure enabling cross-benchmark assessment, continuous data generation, and ongoing insights; leaderboards provide holistic model portraits and call out critical research problems.

Conclusion: Embodied Arena establishes a standardized, evolving evaluation paradigm for Embodied AI, enabling clear objectives, faster benchmarking, and targeted progress toward core capabilities.

Abstract: Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due
to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core
capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2)
absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering
cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and
scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks
for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a
comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our
platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three
levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25
fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research
objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified
infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across
three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced
models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel
LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation
data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied
Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task
Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view),
providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially,
we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the
leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins
and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in
the field of Embodied AI.

### [115] [Measurement and Potential Field-Based Patient Modeling for Model-Mediated Tele-ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15325)
*Ryan S. Yeung,David G. Black,Septimiu E. Salcudean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Updating the internal potential-field model with measured patient forces improves force accuracy in model-mediated tele-ultrasound by integrating a patient surface point cloud into a voxelized field and solving a convex optimization for contact forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperated ultrasound with communication delays requires accurate force feedback to maintain image quality and safe probe contact; prior models using Laplace-based fields have limited transparency. Incorporating measured forces into the internal model can enhance feedback fidelity.

Method: 1) Generate and transmit a point cloud model of the patient’s surface. 2) Convert to a static voxelized volume where each voxel stores a potential-field value. 3) Determine forces and torques from overlap between the voxel volume and a point-shell model of the ultrasound transducer. 4) Solve a convex quadratic that combines the Laplacian (spatial) operator with measured forces to update the potential field. 5) Render feedback based on the updated field. 6) Evaluate on volunteer patients (n=3) by comparing force magnitudes and directions to ground truth.

Result: Inclusion of measured forces reduced force magnitude error by 7.23 N and force-vector angle error by 9.37 degrees relative to a model using only Laplace’s equation.

Conclusion: Updating the internal potential-field model with measured interaction data enhances force estimation and the transparency of model-mediated tele-ultrasound, potentially improving diagnostic imaging quality in teleoperation scenarios.

Abstract: Teleoperated ultrasound can improve diagnostic medical imaging access for
remote communities. Having accurate force feedback is important for enabling
sonographers to apply the appropriate probe contact force to optimize
ultrasound image quality. However, large time delays in communication make
direct force feedback impractical. Prior work investigated using point
cloud-based model-mediated teleoperation and internal potential field models to
estimate contact forces and torques. We expand on this by introducing a method
to update the internal potential field model of the patient with measured
positions and forces for more transparent model-mediated tele-ultrasound. We
first generate a point cloud model of the patient's surface and transmit this
to the sonographer in a compact data structure. This is converted to a static
voxelized volume where each voxel contains a potential field value. These
values determine the forces and torques, which are rendered based on overlap
between the voxelized volume and a point shell model of the ultrasound
transducer. We solve for the potential field using a convex quadratic that
combines the spatial Laplace operator with measured forces. This was evaluated
on volunteer patients ($n=3$) by computing the accuracy of rendered forces.
Results showed the addition of measured forces to the model reduced the force
magnitude error by an average of 7.23 N and force vector angle error by an
average of 9.37$^{\circ}$ compared to using only Laplace's equation.

### [116] [Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion for Mixed-Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15404)
*Shaoting Peng,Katherine Driggs-Campbell,Roy Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion (TA-EBP) proposes a transparent, trust-aware framework for AV-HV interaction, combining Bayesian persuasion with a trust parameter and grounding signals into a continuous, physical action space; validated in mixed-autonomy sims showing fewer collisions and improved traffic flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game-theoretic AV–HV models can erode human trust through manipulation and long-term influence decay, potentially making HVs drive riskier. A transparent, trust-aware persuasion mechanism is needed to stabilize interactions.

Method: Apply Bayesian persuasion to traffic intersection signaling; introduce a quantitative trust parameter and derive a minimum trust level required for influence; ground abstract signals into a continuous action space and derive the optimal signal magnitude as a forward nudge; validate in mixed-autonomy traffic simulations comparing against baselines that ignore trust or communication.

Result: In simulations, TA-EBP persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminates collisions, and improves traffic flow relative to baselines lacking trust or communication.

Conclusion: TA-EBP offers a transparent, non-strategic framework for influence in human-robot interaction, improving safety and efficiency in mixed-autonomy traffic by incorporating trust-aware persuasion and physically grounded signals.

Abstract: Safe and efficient interaction between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and
human-driven vehicles (HVs) is a critical challenge for future transportation
systems. While game-theoretic models capture how AVs influence HVs, they often
suffer from a long-term decay of influence and can be perceived as
manipulative, eroding the human's trust. This can paradoxically lead to riskier
human driving behavior over repeated interactions. In this paper, we address
this challenge by proposing the Trust-Aware Embodied Bayesian Persuasion
(TA-EBP) framework. Our work makes three key contributions: First, we apply
Bayesian persuasion to model communication at traffic intersections, offering a
transparent alternative to traditional game-theoretic models. Second, we
introduce a trust parameter to the persuasion framework, deriving a theorem for
the minimum trust level required for influence. Finally, we ground the abstract
signals of Bayesian persuasion theory into a continuous, physically meaningful
action space, deriving a second theorem for the optimal signal magnitude,
realized as an AV's forward nudge. Additionally, we validate our framework in a
mixed-autonomy traffic simulation, demonstrating that TA-EBP successfully
persuades HVs to drive more cautiously, eliminating collisions and improving
traffic flow compared to baselines that either ignore trust or lack
communication. Our work provides a transparent and non-strategic framework for
influence in human-robot interaction, enhancing both safety and efficiency.

*Easop Lee,Samuel A. Moore,Boyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Data-efficient, fully data-driven framework (Sym2Real) that trains low-level adaptive controllers for quadrotors and racecars using ~10 trajectories, leveraging symbolic regression with residual learning to combine low-fidelity simulations and real-world data for sim2sim and sim2real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics require robust, low-level control with minimal data; simulation-to-reality gaps and noise limit data efficiency. Exploit shared underlying physics and use symbolic regression to derive adaptable models while mitigating noise and model degradation.

Method: Integrate low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world residual learning and symbolic regression to derive robust controllers. Train on ~10 trajectories across quadrotor and racecar platforms, addressing noise sensitivity and degradation. Validate across six sim2sim scenarios and five real-world conditions, demonstrating sim2real transfer.

Result: Achieves robust real-world control for both platforms with only about 10 trajectories, showing consistent data-efficient adaptation across multiple sim2sim and real-world scenarios, and successful sim2real transfer.

Conclusion: Sym2Real shows that combining low-fidelity physics with residual learning and symbolic regression enables data-efficient, safe adaptation for low-level controllers in real-world robotics, suggesting a principled path to bridge sim and real with minimal data.

Abstract: We present Sym2Real, a fully data-driven framework that provides a principled
way to train low-level adaptive controllers in a highly data-efficient manner.
Using only about 10 trajectories, we achieve robust control of both a quadrotor
and a racecar in the real world, without expert knowledge or simulation tuning.
Our approach achieves this data efficiency by bringing symbolic regression to
real-world robotics while addressing key challenges that prevent its direct
application, including noise sensitivity and model degradation that lead to
unsafe control. Our key observation is that the underlying physics is often
shared for a system regardless of internal or external changes. Hence, we
strategically combine low-fidelity simulation data with targeted real-world
residual learning. Through experimental validation on quadrotor and racecar
platforms, we demonstrate consistent data-efficient adaptation across six
out-of-distribution sim2sim scenarios and successful sim2real transfer across
five real-world conditions. More information and videos can be found at at

*Christopher Oeltjen,Carson Sobolewski,Saleh Faghfoorian,Lorant Domokos,Giancarlo Vidal,Ivan Ruchkin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight online slip detection and TRFC estimation method using only IMU and LiDAR, no tire models or training data; slip is detected by commanded vs measured motion, and TRFC is inferred from accelerations under no-slip; validated on a 1:10 autonomous racing car across friction levels with results aligning to ground-truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge of tire-road friction coefficient is critical for safety and performance, especially at the friction limit in autonomous racing. Existing methods rely on uncertain models or large datasets; there is a need for a simple, deployable, data-efficient approach.

Method: Use only IMU, LiDAR, and control actions; detect slip in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions; estimate TRFC directly from observed accelerations under no-slip conditions; no dynamical/tire models, parameter identification, or training data required.

Result: Experiments on a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across different friction levels show accurate and consistent slip detection and friction estimates, closely matching ground-truth measurements and demonstrating computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a simple, deployable, and real-time solution for slip monitoring and TRFC estimation in autonomous driving, with potential applicability in safety-critical and high-performance contexts like racing.

Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is essential
for vehicle safety, stability, and performance, especially in autonomous
racing, where vehicles often operate at the friction limit. However, TRFC
cannot be directly measured with standard sensors, and existing estimation
methods either depend on vehicle or tire models with uncertain parameters or
require large training datasets. In this paper, we present a lightweight
approach for online slip detection and TRFC estimation. Our approach relies
solely on IMU and LiDAR measurements and the control actions, without special
dynamical or tire models, parameter identification, or training data. Slip
events are detected in real time by comparing commanded and measured motions,
and the TRFC is then estimated directly from observed accelerations under
no-slip conditions. Experiments with a 1:10-scale autonomous racing car across
different friction levels demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
accurate and consistent slip detections and friction coefficients, with results
closely matching ground-truth measurements. These findings highlight the
potential of our simple, deployable, and computationally efficient approach for
real-time slip monitoring and friction coefficient estimation in autonomous
driving.

### [119] [Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting for Human-to-humanoid Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15443)
*Xingyu Chen,Hanyu Wu,Sikai Wu,Mingliang Zhou,Diyun Xiang,Haodong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IKMR proposes a scalable, real-time kinodynamic motion retargeting framework that converts large-scale human motion into robot-ready trajectories using a dual-encoder kinematic mapping and dynamics refinement through imitation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frame-by-frame retargeting is not scalable for large human motion data and real-time deployment. There is a need to jointly consider kinematics and dynamics to produce physically feasible trajectories for full-body humanoid control.

Method: In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representations and employs a dual encoder–decoder architecture to learn a mapping between human and robot motion domains. In dynamics, it integrates imitation learning with the retargeting network to refine trajectories into physically feasible ones; the model is fine-tuned using tracking results, enabling real-time retargeting and downstream training of a whole-body controller.

Result: Experiments in simulation and on a full-size humanoid robot show the approach is effective, with claimed real-time, scalable motion retargeting and feasible trajectories.

Conclusion: IKMR enables large-scale, physically feasible humanoid motion retargeting and direct deployment of a whole-body controller, validated by extensive tests in both simulation and real robot settings.

Abstract: Human-to-humanoid imitation learning aims to learn a humanoid whole-body
controller from human motion. Motion retargeting is a crucial step in enabling
robots to acquire reference trajectories when exploring locomotion skills.
However, current methods focus on motion retargeting frame by frame, which
lacks scalability. Could we directly convert large-scale human motion into
robot-executable motion through a more efficient approach? To address this
issue, we propose Implicit Kinodynamic Motion Retargeting (IKMR), a novel
efficient and scalable retargeting framework that considers both kinematics and
dynamics. In kinematics, IKMR pretrains motion topology feature representation
and a dual encoder-decoder architecture to learn a motion domain mapping. In
dynamics, IKMR integrates imitation learning with the motion retargeting
network to refine motion into physically feasible trajectories. After
fine-tuning using the tracking results, IKMR can achieve large-scale physically
feasible motion retargeting in real time, and a whole-body controller could be
directly trained and deployed for tracking its retargeted trajectories. We
conduct our experiments both in the simulator and the real robot on a full-size
humanoid robot. Extensive experiments and evaluation results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

*Reza Pirayeshshirazinezhad,Nima Fathi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for multi-agent robotics that integrates a timed-automata supervisor, Lyapunov-based and sliding-mode continuous controllers, and an explainable predictor, trained via Monte Carlo optimization; validated in spacecraft formation flying and autonomous underwater vehicles, achieving submillimeter alignment and substantially reduced energy use while maintaining bounded errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical, auditable, and transparent decision-making in multi-agent robotics under uncertain 6-DOF dynamics, with domain transferability between space- and underwater environments.

Method: Architecture combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe, auditable mode switching; (ii) robust continuous control using Lyapunov-based large-angle maneuvers and a boundary-layer sliding-mode controller for precision and disturbance rejection; (iii) an explainable predictor that maps mission context to controller gains and expected performance (energy and error). Training data are generated with Monte Carlo simulations to enable transparent real-time trade-offs. Evaluation conducted on spacecraft formation flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

Result: SMC achieved submillimeter alignment in the space mission with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption relative to PD baselines; AUV leader-follower tests showed bounded errors under stochastic currents; overall, the approach demonstrates portability and interpretability for safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

Conclusion: Integrating explainable AI with formal supervisory control yields portable, auditable, and efficient multi-agent robotics across diverse domains, enabling transparent gain selection and reliable performance in uncertain, resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present an explainable AI-enhanced supervisory control framework for
multi-agent robotics that combines (i) a timed-automata supervisor for safe,
auditable mode switching, (ii) robust continuous control (Lyapunov-based
controller for large-angle maneuver; sliding-mode controller (SMC) with
boundary layers for precision and disturbance rejection), and (iii) an
explainable predictor that maps mission context to gains and expected
performance (energy, error). Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the
training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs.
  We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation
flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different
environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share
uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion,
and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic
systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that
meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure
maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error.
In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment
with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to
Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV
tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results
highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for
safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.

### [121] [STARC: See-Through-Wall Augmented Reality Framework for Human-Robot Collaboration in Emergency Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15507)
*Shenghai Yuan,Weixiang Guo,Tianxin Hu,Yu Yang,Jinyu Chen,Rui Qian,Zhongyuan Liu,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cross-LiDAR AR framework called STARC fuses a ground robot's LiDAR-based map with responder-mounted LiDAR to render real-time, occluded humans and hazards in the responder's AR view for improved emergency response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency responders operate in cluttered indoor environments where occlusions hide hazards and victims; real-time, see-through situational awareness is needed to reduce risk and improve rescue outcomes.

Method: A ground robot uses LiDAR-inertial odometry to explore, map, and detect humans. The responder carries helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR, which is registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. Cross-LiDAR alignment enables projecting detected humans and their point clouds into the responder's view as low-latency AR overlays. The system is evaluated in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials; code and design will be open-sourced.

Result: The approach achieves robust pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable AR overlays, with real-time visualization of hidden occupants and hazards, validating the potential of cross-LiDAR AR for safety-critical operations.

Conclusion: STARC demonstrates a feasible, low-latency, cross-LiDAR AR framework that enhances responder situational awareness and reduces operator risk in dangerous indoor environments; its open-source release will facilitate adoption and further development.

Abstract: In emergency response missions, first responders must navigate cluttered
indoor environments where occlusions block direct line-of-sight, concealing
both life-threatening hazards and victims in need of rescue. We present STARC,
a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses
mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot
running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human
detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is
registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This
cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected
humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the
responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and
hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk.
Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust
pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the

### [122] [Distribution Estimation for Global Data Association via Approximate Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15565)
*Yixuan Jia,Mason B. Peterson,Qingyuan Li,Yulun Tian,Jonathan P. How*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a particle-based, approximate Bayesian framework for multimodal global data association to represent multiple plausible transformations rather than a single solution, using GPU-accelerated optimization and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global data association tasks (e.g., registering point clouds or maps) are often highly ambiguous due to repetitive/symmetric structures; single-solution methods fail to capture the full distribution of plausible alignments.

Method: Hypothetical solutions are represented as particles that evolve via deterministic or randomized update rules to explore the modes of the transformation distribution; the framework can incorporate optimization constraints from the data-association formulation and benefits from GPU-parallelized optimization.

Result: Simulated and real-world experiments on highly ambiguous data show the method accurately estimates the distribution over transformations in registration tasks, effectively capturing multiple solution modes.

Conclusion: A multimodal Bayesian data-association framework that avoids premature commitment to a single solution and leverages GPU-accelerated optimization; applicable to point-cloud or object-map registration and robust under ambiguity.

Abstract: Global data association is an essential prerequisite for robot operation in
environments seen at different times or by different robots. Repetitive or
symmetric data creates significant challenges for existing methods, which
typically rely on maximum likelihood estimation or maximum consensus to produce
a single set of associations. However, in ambiguous scenarios, the distribution
of solutions to global data association problems is often highly multimodal,
and such single-solution approaches frequently fail. In this work, we introduce
a data association framework that leverages approximate Bayesian inference to
capture multiple solution modes to the data association problem, thereby
avoiding premature commitment to a single solution under ambiguity. Our
approach represents hypothetical solutions as particles that evolve according
to a deterministic or randomized update rule to cover the modes of the
underlying solution distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method can
incorporate optimization constraints imposed by the data association
formulation and directly benefit from GPU-parallelized optimization. Extensive
simulated and real-world experiments with highly ambiguous data show that our
method correctly estimates the distribution over transformations when
registering point clouds or object maps.

*Yuting Zeng,Zhiwen Zheng,You Zhou,JiaLing Xiao,Yongbin Yu,Manping Fan,Bo Gong,Liyong Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage momentum-constrained hybrid trajectory optimization framework (MHHTOF) combines Frenet-space sampling with a residual DRL refinement (LSTM-ResB-PPO) to enable robust, real-time assistive navigation for visually impaired users, achieving faster convergence and better safety metrics than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe, real-time assistive navigation for visually impaired individuals by integrating optimization-based trajectory planning with learning-based refinement, ensuring smooth, feasible trajectories and reduced risk in cluttered environments.

Method: Stage 1: Generate heuristic trajectory samples (HTSC) in Frenet coordinates using third-order interpolation with fifth-order polynomials under momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints. Stage 2: Use a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based temporal features to refine trajectories in Cartesian coordinates. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages for human-centered optimization.

Result: LSTM-ResB-PPO converges in about half the training iterations of the PPO baseline and improves reward outcomes and training stability. Compared with baselines, average cost decreases by 30.3%, cost variance by 53.3%, and ego/obstacle risks drop by over 77%.

Conclusion: MHHTOF demonstrates improved robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility for complex assistive planning tasks, with the dual-stage cost modeling and weight transfer facilitating human-centered optimization and faster policy learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a momentum-constrained hybrid heuristic trajectory
optimization framework (MHHTOF) tailored for assistive navigation in visually
impaired scenarios, integrating trajectory sampling generation, optimization
and evaluation with residual-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL). In the
first stage, heuristic trajectory sampling cluster (HTSC) is generated in the
Frenet coordinate system using third-order interpolation with fifth-order
polynomials and momentum-constrained trajectory optimization (MTO) constraints
to ensure smoothness and feasibility. After first stage cost evaluation, the
second stage leverages a residual-enhanced actor-critic network with LSTM-based
temporal feature modeling to adaptively refine trajectory selection in the
Cartesian coordinate system. A dual-stage cost modeling mechanism (DCMM) with
weight transfer aligns semantic priorities across stages, supporting
human-centered optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
LSTM-ResB-PPO achieves significantly faster convergence, attaining stable
policy performance in approximately half the training iterations required by
the PPO baseline, while simultaneously enhancing both reward outcomes and
training stability. Compared to baseline method, the selected model reduces
average cost and cost variance by 30.3% and 53.3%, and lowers ego and obstacle
risks by over 77%. These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing robustness, safety, and real-time feasibility in complex assistive
planning tasks.

*Runxin Zhao,Chunxiang Wang,Hanyang Zhuang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a dataset and benchmark for infrastructure-based vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs, comparing repetitive and non-repetitive scanning patterns to guide pattern choice for multi-vehicle localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Roadside LiDAR-based vehicle localization can achieve centimeter-level accuracy and support multiple vehicles, but non-repetitive scanning LiDARs are underexplored in roadside perception. There is a need to benchmark scanning patterns (repetitive vs non-repetitive) in infrastructure-based localization.

Method: Collected a dataset with 5,445 frames of point clouds over eight vehicle trajectories using both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs; established baselines for infrastructure-based vehicle localization; compared performance across scanning patterns; dataset and code released publicly.

Result: Baseline experiments reveal performance differences between repetitive and non-repetitive LiDAR patterns; provide insights into which scanning pattern is more suitable for infrastructure-based localization; dataset serves as a benchmark for evaluating such methods.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmarks advance infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization research by enabling fair comparisons across LiDAR patterns; public availability of data and code facilitates broader adoption and method development.

Abstract: Vehicle localization using roadside LiDARs can provide centimeter-level
accuracy for cloud-controlled vehicles while simultaneously serving multiple
vehicles, enhanc-ing safety and efficiency. While most existing studies rely on
repetitive scanning LiDARs, non-repetitive scanning LiDAR offers advantages
such as eliminating blind zones and being more cost-effective. However, its
application in roadside perception and localization remains limited. To address
this, we present a dataset for infrastructure-based vehicle localization, with
data collected from both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning LiDARs, in
order to benchmark the performance of different LiDAR scanning patterns. The
dataset contains 5,445 frames of point clouds across eight vehicle trajectory
sequences, with diverse trajectory types. Our experiments establish base-lines
for infrastructure-based vehicle localization and compare the performance of
these methods using both non-repetitive and repetitive scanning LiDARs. This
work offers valuable insights for selecting the most suitable LiDAR scanning
pattern for infrastruc-ture-based vehicle localization. Our dataset is a
signifi-cant contribution to the scientific community, supporting advancements
in infrastructure-based perception and vehicle localization. The dataset and
source code are publicly available at:

heterogeneous multi-robot systems. The algorithm utilises distributed
optimisation and output control to achieve the Nash equilibrium by leveraging
information shared among neighbouring robots. Specifically, we propose a
distributed optimisation algorithm that calculates the Nash equilibrium as a
tailored reference for each robot and designs output control laws for
heterogeneous multi-robot systems to track it in an aggregative game. We prove
that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge and result in efficient outcomes.
The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ORB is a modular, behavior-tree–driven framework for autonomous operating-room logistics, enabling real-time perception and manipulation with high success rates (80% supply retrieval, 96% restocking).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating item-level logistics in operating rooms is critical for safety and efficiency, but challenges include perception, sterility, and efficient, collision-free manipulation.

Method: A modular software architecture based on hierarchical behavior trees; a real-time object recognition pipeline combining YOLOv7, SAM2, and Grounded DINO; adaptation of the cuRobo trajectory optimization framework for parallelized, real-time, collision-free mobile manipulation; GPU-accelerated motion planning.

Result: Empirical validation showing 80% success in OR supply retrieval and 96% success in restocking, demonstrating reliability and adaptability in autonomous OR logistics.

Conclusion: ORB demonstrates that a BT-based, perception‑integrated, GPU-accelerated framework can reliably automate OR logistics, providing a solid foundation for autonomous in-OR item handling.

Abstract: Efficiently delivering items to an ongoing surgery in a hospital operating
room can be a matter of life or death. In modern hospital settings, delivery
robots have successfully transported bulk items between rooms and floors.
However, automating item-level operating room logistics presents unique
challenges in perception, efficiency, and maintaining sterility. We propose the
Operating Room Bot (ORB), a robot framework to automate logistics tasks in
hospital operating rooms (OR). ORB leverages a robust, hierarchical behavior
tree (BT) architecture to integrate diverse functionalities of object
recognition, scene interpretation, and GPU-accelerated motion planning. The
contributions of this paper include: (1) a modular software architecture
facilitating robust mobile manipulation through behavior trees; (2) a novel
real-time object recognition pipeline integrating YOLOv7, Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2), and Grounded DINO; (3) the adaptation of the cuRobo
parallelized trajectory optimization framework to real-time, collision-free
mobile manipulation; and (4) empirical validation demonstrating an 80% success
rate in OR supply retrieval and a 96% success rate in restocking operations.
These contributions establish ORB as a reliable and adaptable system for
autonomous OR logistics.

### [127] [PRIMT: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Multimodal Feedback and Trajectory Synthesis from Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15607)
*Ruiqi Wang,Dezhong Zhao,Ziqin Yuan,Tianyu Shao,Guohua Chen,Dominic Kao,Sungeun Hong,Byung-Cheol Min*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PRIMT is a foundation-model–driven, multimodal PbRL framework that uses hierarchical neuro-symbolic feedback and trajectory augmentation (foresight and hindsight) to improve learning and credit assignment, achieving superior performance across locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PbRL often requires extensive human input and suffers from query ambiguity and credit assignment in reward learning. Single-modality FM feedback can be insufficient, motivating a multimodal, reliable feedback mechanism.

Method: PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion of large language models and vision-language models to assess robot behaviors through multimodal feedback; it introduces foresight trajectory generation by warm-starting the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples and hindsight trajectory augmentation with counterfactual reasoning and a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment.

Result: PRIMT demonstrates superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines on 2 locomotion tasks and 6 manipulation tasks across benchmarks.

Conclusion: PRIMT shows that integrating multimodal FM feedback with trajectory augmentation can enhance PbRL effectiveness, reducing heavy human input and mitigating query ambiguity and credit- assignment challenges.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising
paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering.
However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the
reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving
query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we
introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by
leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and
trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM
evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy,
integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and
vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and
comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory
generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the
trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory
augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary
loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6
manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance
over FM-based and scripted baselines.

### [128] [Miniature soft robot with magnetically reprogrammable surgical functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15610)
*Chelsea Shan Xian Ng,Yu Xuan Yeoh,Nicholas Yong Wei Foo,Keerthana Radhakrishnan,Guo Zhan Lum*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A millimeter-scale, magnetization-reprogrammable soft robot achieves six-DOF motion and five surgical functions under relatively weak uniform magnetic fields, enabling untethered, deeper minimally invasive operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing magnetically actuated micro-robots (typically limited DOF and onboard functionalities, or proximity-limited operation) and enable safe, depth-penetrating, untethered surgical capabilities.

Method: Fabricate a millimeter-scale soft robot with reprogrammable magnetization and control it via external magnetic fields (up to 65 mT, 1.5 T/m) to realize full six-DOF including rotation about its net magnetic moment; demonstrate five surgical functions—drug dispensing, cutting through gelatin (tissue), gripping, storing biological samples, and remote heating; also show rolling and two-anchor crawling in challenging environments.

Result: Achieved full six-DOF motion including rotation about the net magnetic moment; demonstrated rolling and two-anchor crawling; operated under relatively weak, uniform magnetic fields suitable for tissue depths; validated five surgical functionalities in experiments.

Conclusion: Represents a major milestone for soft actuators and untethered miniature surgical robots, enabling unprecedented multifunctionality and potential to revolutionize minimally invasive treatments.

Abstract: Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have significant potential
to make existing minimally invasive surgery considerably safer and painless,
and enable unprecedented treatments because they are much smaller and dexterous
than existing surgical robots. Of the miniature robots, the magnetically
actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic
miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either
restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited
five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only
operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external
magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a
millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed
upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting
through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing
(biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions,
including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot
can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured
environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our
actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and
1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues
harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of
the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the
advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive
treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented
functionalities.

Abstract: We extend our work on a novel indoor positioning system (IPS) for autonomous
mobile robots (AMRs) based on radar sensing of local, passive radar reflectors.
Through the combination of simple reflectors and a single-channel frequency

optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented that optimizes the 2D placement of
radar reflectors in complex room settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wide-field LiDAR provides dense 3D geometry but existing LIVO systems with a single camera suffer from limited spatial coverage and reduced robustness due to FoV mismatch. Introducing multiple cameras can bridge the visual field gap and improve reliability.

Method: Introduce Cross-View direct tracking to maintain photometric consistency across non-overlapping camera views and extend the Error-State Iterated Kalman Filter (ESIKF) with multi-view updates and adaptive covariance weighting, enabling tight fusion of LiDAR, IMU, and multi-camera visual data.

Result: Evaluations on public benchmarks and a custom dataset show improved accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art LIVO, LIO, and visual-inertial baselines.

Conclusion: Omni-LIVO demonstrates that tightly integrating multi-camera visual data with wide FoV LiDAR via cross-view tracking and multi-view ESIKF updates yields superior robustness and accuracy, with code and dataset to be released.

Abstract: Wide field-of-view (FoV) LiDAR sensors provide dense geometry across large

*Haoran Ding,Anqing Duan,Zezhou Sun,Dezhen Song,Yoshihiko Nakamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imaginative perception via diffusion-based view synthesis, conditioned on agent–in-hand pose, improves visuomotor policy performance without real in-hand cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hardware constraints often prevent equipping robots with dedicated in-hand cameras; generating plausible in-hand views from external observations at inference time can boost control accuracy and robustness.

Method: Fine-tune a pretrained diffusion-based neural view synthesis model (ZeroNVS) using LoRA conditioning on the relative pose to synthesize in-hand views from agent views during policy execution.

Result: Synthesized in-hand views significantly improve policy inference and recover performance loss due to the absence of real in-hand cameras, as demonstrated on RoboMimic, MimicGen, and real-world strawberry-picking with a Unitree Z1.

Conclusion: Imaginative perception offers a scalable, hardware-light approach to robust visuomotor control and highlights the potential of imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

Abstract: Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the
performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these,
egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise
control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand
cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and
cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception -
enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference
time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned
diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand
views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a
pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate
our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and
real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking
task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy
inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of
real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution
for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of
imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GP3 introduces a 3D geometry-aware manipulation policy that uses a multi-view RGB-based spatial encoder to infer dense features, estimate depth and camera parameters, and produce a compact 3D scene representation fused with language instructions, which is then mapped to actions. It achieves strong sim performance and real-world transfer without depth sensors, with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise 3D scene understanding is essential for robust robotic manipulation. Multi-view cues can recover geometry without explicit depth sensors or prior maps, enabling a sensor-agnostic approach that improves sim-to-real transfer.

Method: A spatial encoder converts RGB observations into dense spatial features to estimate depth and camera parameters, forming a compact 3D scene representation. This representation is fused with language instructions and fed into a lightweight policy head that outputs continuous actions.

Result: GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated benchmarks and transfers effectively to real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring only minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GP3 provides a practical, sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation by leveraging multi-view RGB-derived 3D representations integrated with language guidance.

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation relies on a precise understanding of 3D scene
geometry, and one of the most straightforward ways to acquire such geometry is
through multi-view observations. Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D
geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3
employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB
observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters,
leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for
manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and
translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to
real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring
only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical,
sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.

*Heye Huang,Yibin Yang,Wang Chen,Tiantian Chen,Xiaopeng Li,Sikai Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SMART is a hierarchical, scalable planning framework for multi-vehicle systems that decouples a non-convex problem into convex subproblems via space partitioning and robust corridors, using RL-guided priority estimation and large-step hybrid A* at the upper layer and parallel convex optimization at the lower layer, enabling real-time, large-scale coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the non-convex, collision-constrained nature of multi-vehicle trajectory planning in dense environments, where the number of constraints and interactions grows rapidly, making real-time coordination challenging.

Method: A two-layer architecture: upper layer uses reinforcement-learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A* to explore diverse interaction modes; lower layer solves parallelizable convex optimization problems within spatially partitioned corridors. Space is partitioned among neighboring vehicles to decouple the joint problem into convex subproblems that can be solved in parallel, ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision avoidance. The system leverages V2X communication and roadside sensing for coordination.

Result: SMART outperforms baselines across tested scenarios. On 50 m x 50 m maps, it achieves >90% success within 1 s for up to 25 vehicles; on 100 m x 100 m maps, >95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles, with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only approaches. Real-world experiments report planning times as low as 0.014 s, validating fast, cooperative planning.

Conclusion: The framework delivers scalable, safe, and real-time multi-vehicle planning suitable for dense environments and large fleets, combining hierarchical search with parallel convex optimization and leveraging V2X cooperation to improve scalability and safety.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning is a non-convex problem that becomes
increasingly difficult in dense environments due to the rapid growth of
collision constraints. Efficient exploration of feasible behaviors and
resolution of tight interactions are essential for real-time, large-scale
coordination. This paper introduces SMART, Scalable Multi-Agent Reasoning and
Trajectory Planning, a hierarchical framework that combines priority-based
search with distributed optimization to achieve efficient and feasible
multi-vehicle planning. The upper layer explores diverse interaction modes
using reinforcement learning-based priority estimation and large-step hybrid A*
search, while the lower layer refines solutions via parallelizable convex
optimization. By partitioning space among neighboring vehicles and constructing
robust feasible corridors, the method decouples the joint non-convex problem
into convex subproblems solved efficiently in parallel. This design alleviates
the step-size trade-off while ensuring kinematic feasibility and collision
avoidance. Experiments show that SMART consistently outperforms baselines. On
50 m x 50 m maps, it sustains over 90% success within 1 s up to 25 vehicles,
while baselines often drop below 50%. On 100 m x 100 m maps, SMART achieves
above 95% success up to 50 vehicles and remains feasible up to 90 vehicles,
with runtimes more than an order of magnitude faster than optimization-only
approaches. Built on vehicle-to-everything communication, SMART incorporates
vehicle-infrastructure cooperation through roadside sensing and agent
coordination, improving scalability and safety. Real-world experiments further
validate this design, achieving planning times as low as 0.014 s while
preserving cooperative behaviors.

*Yuyang Zhang,Zhuoli Tian,Jinsheng Wei,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A human-centric, multi-robot exploration framework (FlyKites) for communication-limited environments, featuring spread (distributed exploration with intermittent comms), relay (jointly optimizing relay topology, operator path, and robot roles), and human-in-the-loop execution, validated via simulations and hardware experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In unknown environments (e.g., caves, tunnels) with restricted ad-hoc networks, robots must encounter unanticipated targets, blocked passages, or failures while maintaining reliable human-assisted communication; existing approaches struggle under severe communication constraints.

Method: Three interleaved components: (I) spread mode for distributed exploration and intermittent data exchange between robots and the operator; (II) relay mode for simultaneous optimization of relay topology, operator path, and robot-to-relay assignments to minimize response delay; (III) human-in-the-loop online execution with dynamic role switching and operator interaction.

Result: The framework is validated through extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments across numerous challenging scenes, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness under limited communication.

Conclusion: FlyKites offers a novel, human-centric exploration framework for multi-robot systems operating in severely communication-restricted environments, enabling reliable assistance, adaptive collaboration, and robust exploration in extreme scenarios.

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots have been deployed for exploration of unknown
scenes for features of interest, e.g., subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, search and rescue missions. During exploration, the robots may
encounter un-identified targets, blocked passages, interactive objects,
temporary failure, or other unexpected events, all of which require consistent
human assistance with reliable communication for a time period. This however
can be particularly challenging if the communication among the robots is
severely restricted to only close-range exchange via ad-hoc networks,
especially in extreme environments like caves and underground tunnels. This
paper presents a novel human-centric interactive exploration and assistance
framework called FlyKites, for multi-robot systems under limited communication.
It consists of three interleaved components: (I) the distributed exploration
and intermittent communication (called the "spread mode"), where the robots
collaboratively explore the environment and exchange local data among the fleet
and with the operator; (II) the simultaneous optimization of the relay
topology, the operator path, and the assignment of robots to relay roles
(called the "relay mode"), such that all requested assistance can be provided
with minimum delay; (III) the human-in-the-loop online execution, where the
robots switch between different roles and interact with the operator
adaptively. Extensive human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments
are performed over numerous challenging scenes.

*Chuhao Qin,Arun Narayanan,Evangelos Pournaras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-stage, energy-aware drone swarm framework for multi-parcel last-mile delivery that combines K-means depot clustering, RL-determined flight ranges, optimized plan selection, and actor-critic multi-agent DRL to minimize energy and delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for fast, safe, and cost-efficient last-mile delivery with drones, especially for urgent medical deliveries; energy and time constraints necessitate coordinated, scalable solutions.

Method: Decompose into: (1) depot/service-area optimization via K-means clustering; (2) drone flight-range optimization via reinforcement learning; (3) multi-parcel routing via a new plan-selection method; integrate with actor-critic based multi-agent DRL to coordinate the swarm.

Result: Extensive experiments on realistic delivery datasets show exceptional performance, with reductions in energy consumption, delivery delays, and overall execution time; provides practical insights on economics and depot deployment strategies.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical, scalable guidance for deploying drone swarms in last-mile logistics, with potential for real-world deployment and extension to broader constraints and future research.

Abstract: Drones have recently emerged as a faster, safer, and cost-efficient way for
last-mile deliveries of parcels, particularly for urgent medical deliveries
highlighted during the pandemic. This paper addresses a new challenge of
multi-parcel delivery with a swarm of energy-aware drones, accounting for
time-sensitive customer requirements. Each drone plans an optimal multi-parcel
route within its battery-restricted flight range to minimize delivery delays
and reduce energy consumption. The problem is tackled by decomposing it into
three sub-problems: (1) optimizing depot locations and service areas using
K-means clustering; (2) determining the optimal flight range for drones through
reinforcement learning; and (3) planning and selecting multi-parcel delivery
routes via a new optimized plan selection approach. To integrate these
solutions and enhance long-term efficiency, we propose a novel algorithm
leveraging actor-critic-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
Extensive experimentation using realistic delivery datasets demonstrate an
exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm. We provide new insights into
economic efficiency (minimize energy consumption), rapid operations (reduce
delivery delays and overall execution time), and strategic guidance on depot
deployment for practical logistics applications.

### [136] [High-Bandwidth Tactile-Reactive Control for Grasp Adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15876)
*Yonghyeon Lee,Tzu-Yuan Lin,Alexander Alexiev,Sangbae Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Purely tactile-feedback grasp-adjustment controller improves robustness of grasping without requiring object geometry or accurate initial grasp; validated via simulation and real-world tests on a 15-DoF arm-hand with high-bandwidth tactile sensing at 200 Hz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based grasping suffers from calibration errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, causing contact uncertainty. High-bandwidth tactile feedback can enhance robustness against perception errors.

Method: Proposes a tactile-reactive grasp-adjustment algorithm that relies solely on tactile feedback. It does not require prior object geometry or an accurate initial grasp pose and can refine grasps from crude configurations and uncertain contact points. Evaluated in simulation and on a 15-DoF robot with an 8-DoF hand and fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved grasp stability and robustness to perception errors, validating the effectiveness of tactile-only feedback for grasp refinement.

Conclusion: High-bandwidth tactile feedback paired with a tactile-reactive controller can substantially improve grasp robustness under perception errors, enabling refinement from crude initial grasps without explicit object models.

Abstract: Vision-only grasping systems are fundamentally constrained by calibration
errors, sensor noise, and grasp pose prediction inaccuracies, leading to
unavoidable contact uncertainty in the final stage of grasping. High-bandwidth
tactile feedback, when paired with a well-designed tactile-reactive controller,
can significantly improve robustness in the presence of perception errors. This
paper contributes to controller design by proposing a purely tactile-feedback
grasp-adjustment algorithm. The proposed controller requires neither prior
knowledge of the object's geometry nor an accurate grasp pose, and is capable
of refining a grasp even when starting from a crude, imprecise initial
configuration and uncertain contact points. Through simulation studies and
real-world experiments on a 15-DoF arm-hand system (featuring an 8-DoF hand)
equipped with fingertip tactile sensors operating at 200 Hz, we demonstrate
that our tactile-reactive grasping framework effectively improves grasp
stability.

### [137] [Improving Robotic Manipulation with Efficient Geometry-Aware Vision Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15880)
*An Dinh Vuong,Minh Nhat Vu,Ian Reid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometry-aware encoders (VGGT) improve imitation learning for robotic manipulation; introduces eVGGT as a distilled, efficient alternative; shows up to 6.5% gains in success rate and significant compute savings; code release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-only encoders lack explicit 3D reasoning; geometry-aware models promise better spatial understanding for manipulation; need to balance performance with computational cost for real-world deployment.

Method: Integrate a geometry-aware encoder into imitation learning frameworks (ACT and DP). Evaluate on single- and bi-manual tasks in simulation and real world. Propose eVGGT, a distilled, efficient encoder from VGGT; compare performance and compute; plan to release code and pretrained models.

Result: Achieves up to 6.5% improvement in success rate over standard encoders across tasks and settings; eVGGT is ~9x faster and 5x smaller than VGGT while preserving 3D reasoning; results demonstrated in both simulation and real-world; code release planned.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware vision representations enhance imitation learning for robotic manipulation; efficiency via distillation (eVGGT) makes practical deployment feasible; open-sourcing will accelerate research.

Abstract: Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional
vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning
capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as
VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are
promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the
integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation.
Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into
imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5%
improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and
bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings.
Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high
computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To
address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder
distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than
VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained
models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware
robotics.

*Johannes Köhler,Daniel Zhang,Raffaele Soloperto,Andrea Carron,Melanie Zeilinger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An MPC framework augments finite-horizon optimization with a finite-segment shortest path planner to enable fast, collision-free navigation for nonlinear mobile robots in cluttered environments, with dynamic target handling and hardware validation showing 2–3 s target re-acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve reliable, fast navigation for mobile robots operating in cluttered, possibly dynamic environments where targets can change and nonlinear dynamics complicate planning; traditional MPC alone may struggle with obstacle avoidance and path feasibility under changeable targets.

Method: Integrate a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon trajectory optimization of an MPC. The planner guides the MPC toward dynamically selected targets, maintaining collision avoidance through the short-path planning layer, and accommodating general nonlinear dynamics. The approach is validated on a small ground robot with human-in-the-loop target assignment.

Result: Hardware experiments demonstrated successful navigation through complex environments with dynamic targets. The robot reached new targets within 2–3 seconds, indicating rapid re-planning and execution in practice.

Conclusion: The combined MPC-plus-shortest-path framework provides enforced collision avoidance and convergence to dynamically chosen targets in cluttered environments with nonlinear dynamics, and shows practical viability on real robots with human-guided target updates.

Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for efficient
navigation of mobile robots in cluttered environments. The proposed approach
integrates a finite-segment shortest path planner into the finite-horizon
trajectory optimization of the MPC. This formulation ensures convergence to
dynamically selected targets and guarantees collision avoidance, even under
general nonlinear dynamics and cluttered environments. The approach is
validated through hardware experiments on a small ground robot, where a human
operator dynamically assigns target locations. The robot successfully navigated
through complex environments and reached new targets within 2-3 seconds.

### [139] [A Vision-Language-Action-Critic Model for Robotic Real-World Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15937)
*Shaopeng Zhai,Qi Zhang,Tianyi Zhang,Fuxian Huang,Haoran Zhang,Ming Zhou,Shengzhe Zhang,Litao Liu,Sixu Lin,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLAC is a general process reward model that predicts progress and termination signals from vision-language-action observations, enabling one-shot transfer and eliminating task-specific reward engineering; deployed in real-world RL with human-in-the-loop, it dramatically boosts success rates and sample efficiency across four manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse handcrafted rewards and inefficient exploration hinder real-world robotic RL; a unified model that can generate rewards and influence actions from language goals and observations can accelerate learning and transfer to new tasks.

Method: Train VLAC on InternVL-based and large-scale heterogeneous data; use vision-language datasets plus robot and human trajectories; prompt-driven generation of reward and action tokens; integrate in asynchronous real-world RL loop with graded human-in-the-loop (offline demos, return-and-explore, guided exploration); construct many negative and semantically mismatched samples to improve rejection and regression detection.

Result: On four real-world manipulation tasks, success rates rose from ~30% to ~90% within 200 episodes; adding human-in-the-loop yielded ~50% more sample efficiency and up to 100% final success.

Conclusion: A general process reward model can effectively unify critic and policy, reduce reward engineering, and enable rapid, data-efficient real-world RL with vision-language-action systems; human-in-the-loop further amplifies gains and stability.

Abstract: Robotic real-world reinforcement learning (RL) with vision-language-action
(VLA) models is bottlenecked by sparse, handcrafted rewards and inefficient
exploration. We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon
InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise
observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done
signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot
in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on
vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning
capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground
action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to
reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by
constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples.
With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and
action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous
real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline
demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that
accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct
real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to
about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating
human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample
efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.

### [140] [Right-Side-Out: Learning Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Garment Reversal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15953)
*Chang Yu,Siyu Ma,Wenxin Du,Zeshun Zong,Han Xue,Wendi Chen,Cewu Lu,Yin Yang,Xuchen Han,Joseph Masterjohn,Alejandro Castro,Chenfanfu Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A zero-shot sim-to-real framework (Right-Side-Out) that turns garments right-side-out using a two-stage, depth-informed, keypoint-based bimanual policy trained in a GPU-accelerated MPM simulator, achieving up to 81.3% success on real robots with a single depth camera.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Turning garments right-side-out is highly dynamic, involves rapid contact changes and severe visual occlusion. It is difficult to transfer policies from simulation to real world without demonstrations, creating a need for scalable, annotation-free sim-to-real approaches.

Method: Decompose the task into a two-stage plan: (1) Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an opening, and (2) Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses depth-inferred, keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitives to sharply reduce the action space while preserving robustness. Data is generated automatically in a high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator that models thin-shell deformation and robust contact handling for batched rollouts. The pipeline randomizes garment geometry, material parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint labels without any human annotations. Policies trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware with a single depth camera.

Result: Real-world experiments show up to 81.3% success rate. The approach scales data generation, reduces reliance on human demonstrations, and demonstrates robust zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation paired with task decomposition enables tackling highly dynamic and occluded manipulation tasks without laborious human demonstrations, enabling effective zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Turning garments right-side out is a challenging manipulation task: it is
highly dynamic, entails rapid contact changes, and is subject to severe visual
occlusion. We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that
effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose
the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by
Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred,
keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space
while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our
custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator
that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact
handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated
pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material
parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint
labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies
trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up
to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity
simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded
tasks without laborious human demonstrations.

### [141] [Swarm Oracle: Trustless Blockchain Agreements through Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15956)
*Alexandre Pacheco,Hanqing Zhao,Volker Strobel,Tarik Roukny,Gregory Dudek,Andreagiovanni Reina,Marco Dorigo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized, swarm-based oracle for blockchains, using a multi-stakeholder robot swarm and Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus to verify real-world data, with a blockchain-token reputation mechanism for fault/attack recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge real-world data to blockchains without centralized trust or single-party bias; existing oracles may compromise autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce trust.

Method: A network of autonomous robots with onboard sensing and peer-to-peer communication collaboratively verifies data and reaches consensus via a Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol across stakeholders; integrates robots from multiple owners to reduce bias; employs a blockchain-token-based reputation system to recover from faults/attacks; evaluated through real and simulated experiments in remote/uncertain environments.

Result: Demonstrates consensus on uncertain environmental data despite attacks orchestrated by many robots; shows robustness and higher-quality social consensus; presents autonomous recovery via reputation/token mechanism enabling long-term operation.

Conclusion: Swarm Oracle shows how robot swarms can provide secure, trustless global data feeds for blockchains, combining decentralization, fault tolerance, and mobility; while multi-stakeholder integration introduces adversarial risk, the proposed BFT protocol and token-based reputation enable resilient, long-term operation and scalability.

Abstract: Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits
access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some
participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains,
but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the
need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous
robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer
communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart
contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in
decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can
flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote
locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates
robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party
biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the
secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a
Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different
stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality
than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using
both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain
environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks
orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system
based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults
and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.

### [142] [CoReVLA: A Dual-Stage End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework for Long-Tail Scenarios via Collect-and-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15968)
*Shiyu Fang,Yiming Cui,Haoyang Liang,Chen Lv,Peng Hang,Jian Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoReVLA is a continual-learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that uses a two-stage process (data collection from diverse driving QA data and simulation-driven takeover data) refined by Direct Preference Optimization to improve long-tail, safety-critical driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-tail, safety-critical driving scenarios are rare but contribute disproportionately to accidents; current vision-language action models lack high-quality data and efficient learning in these conditions.

Method: Dual-stage approach: (1) fine-tune on open-source driving QA datasets to build a foundational driving understanding; (2) deploy in the CAVE simulator to collect driver takeover data highlighting failure cases; (3) refine the model via Direct Preference Optimization using human preferences to avoid reward hacking; evaluate with open-loop and closed-loop experiments on Bench2Drive.

Result: Bench2Drive Driving Score (DS) = 72.18 and Success Rate (SR) = 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art by 7.96 DS and 15% SR in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios; case studies show continual improvement by leveraging past takeover experiences; code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: CoReVLA demonstrates effective continual learning for vision-language action in autonomous driving, achieving better handling of long-tail, safety-critical scenarios and enabling continual improvement through experiential data, while mitigating reward-hacking risks through DPO.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their
performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare
cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action
(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,
but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and
inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework
that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage
process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly
fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to
acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is
deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation
platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.
Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle
reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid
reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and
closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can
accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the
Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a
Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and
15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies
demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in
similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences. All

### [143] [Defining and Monitoring Complex Robot Activities via LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16006)
*Francesco Argenziano,Elena Umili,Francesco Leotta,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A general architecture fusing Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning to specify and monitor high-level, multi-task activities in dynamic environments, demonstrated in a precision agriculture setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic industrial/agricultural contexts, activities are composed of multiple atomic tasks and their combinations vary with the situation. Humans also need to monitor progress of high-level processes to ensure safety-critical operation, which is not well supported by current autonomous systems.

Method: Propose and implement a general architecture that integrates LLMs with automated planning, enabling natural-language specification of high-level processes and real-time monitoring by querying a robot. The implementation uses state-of-the-art components and is evaluated in a real-world precision agriculture scenario.

Result: The approach is quantitatively evaluated in a real-world precision agriculture setting, demonstrating feasibility and potential benefits for monitoring and steering multi-task robotic processes.

Conclusion: The integration of LLMs with automated planning provides a viable framework for natural-language specification and monitoring of high-level activities in dynamic environments, with successful validation in precision agriculture and potential applicability to other domains.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive
and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by
deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial
and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that
activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible
tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover,
despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the
progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future
actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of
safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture
that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling
humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using
natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also
present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art
components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision
agriculture scenario.

### [144] [A Matter of Height: The Impact of a Robotic Object on Human Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16032)
*Michael Faber,Andrey Grishko,Julian Waksberg,David Pardo,Tomer Leivy,Yuval Hazan,Emanuel Talmansky,Benny Megidish,Hadas Erel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Height influences compliance in human-robot interaction but not in the same way as in human-human dynamics: a shorter, non-humanoid robot elicited more volunteerism for a tedious task than a taller version.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether the well-documented effect of height on persuasiveness in human interactions transfers to human-robot interactions, specifically with a non-humanoid robot, and to understand how height interacts with robot design.

Method: Two height conditions of a mobile service-table robot were created by modular height changes (95 cm short vs 132 cm tall, with 2 vs 3 modules). Participants first completed a computer-based cognitive task (framed as the main experiment). Afterward, during a delay before credits, the robot entered with a tablet inviting participation in a 300-question questionnaire. Compliance was measured as acceptance of the invitation.

Result: Participants showed higher compliance with the short robot’s request than with the tall robot’s request, an effect opposite to typical human-height dynamics.

Conclusion: Height affects social dynamics in human-robot interaction but the pattern differs from human-human interactions. Designers should empirically test social-dynamics hypotheses in robots rather than assuming direct transfers from human social behavior.

Abstract: Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may
shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a
characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically
perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same
impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly
non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be
easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering
other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated
participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious
task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer,
which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the
experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic
object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying
a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire
voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short
robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of
three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with
the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics.
We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot
interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest
that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social
dynamics to robots without testing them first.

### [145] [Learning Safety for Obstacle Avoidance via Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16037)
*Shuo Liu,Zhe Huang,Calin A. Belta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based local safety ball (LSB) with a discrete-time high-order CBF (DHOCBF) is used to enable fast, continuous-time collision-free navigation for robots with arbitrary, nonconvex geometries in cluttered environments, via a relaxable nonlinear optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing control barrier function (CBF) approaches rely on analytic clearance or polytopic approximations, which are infeasible for complex, unknown robot geometries. There is a need for real-time, scalable safety guarantees for arbitrary shapes during navigation.

Method: Train a residual neural network on a large dataset of robot–obstacle configurations to predict clearance (LSB radius). Use the predicted clearance to define a boundary encoded as a DHOCBF, incorporated into a nonlinear optimization with a relaxation technique to improve feasibility; ensure collision-free motion between consecutive time steps, bridging discrete-time control with continuous-time safety.

Result: The framework handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot geometries and yields collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in cluttered environments with millisecond-level solve times and high prediction accuracy, outperforming existing CBF-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a scalable, real-time Safe Navigation solution by coupling learned clearance with CBF-based constraints, enabling safe, efficient planning for complex robots in challenging environments.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with
arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments.
Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic
clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on
polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations
are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural
network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and
tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted
clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures
continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a
Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into
a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation
technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's
rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free,
effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show
that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot
geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in
cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times
and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond
existing CBF-based methods.

### [146] [Compose by Focus: Scene Graph-based Atomic Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16053)
*Han Qi,Changhe Chen,Heng Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Scene-graph based compositional skill learning for long-horizon robotic tasks, combining graph neural networks and diffusion-based imitation learning with a vision-language model (VLM) guided planner to improve robustness and compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robots require compositional generalization to combine atomic skills for complex tasks; visuomotor policies often degrade under distribution shifts caused by scene variation, and planning with pre-learned skills alone may not ensure robust execution.

Method: Represent scenes as task-relevant scene graphs (objects+relations); use graph neural networks integrated with diffusion-based imitation learning for skill acquisition; jointly leverage a VLM-based task planner to route focused scene-graph skills.

Result: Empirical evaluation in both simulation and real-world manipulation shows substantially higher success rates compared with state-of-the-art baselines, with improved robustness and compositional generalization in long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: A scene-graph skill learning framework can enhance robustness and compositional generalization by focusing on relevant objects/relations and combining structured planning with robust imitation learning, enabling more reliable long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Abstract: A key requirement for generalist robots is compositional generalization - the
ability to combine atomic skills to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. While
prior work has primarily focused on synthesizing a planner that sequences
pre-learned skills, robust execution of the individual skills themselves
remains challenging, as visuomotor policies often fail under distribution
shifts induced by scene composition. To address this, we introduce a scene
graph-based representation that focuses on task-relevant objects and relations,
thereby mitigating sensitivity to irrelevant variation. Building on this idea,
we develop a scene-graph skill learning framework that integrates graph neural
networks with diffusion-based imitation learning, and further combine "focused"
scene-graph skills with a vision-language model (VLM) based task planner.
Experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate
substantially higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines,
highlighting improved robustness and compositional generalization in
long-horizon tasks.

*Maciej Stępień,Rafael Kourdis,Constant Roux,Olivier Stasse*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multipurpose imitation-trained loco-manipulation policy with latent control, augmented by a diffusion-based discriminator and constraint handling, is demonstrated on humanoid and quadruped robots in simulation and on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current control methods (e.g., deep RL) typically learn single skills, which is inefficient for tasks requiring high-level goals, robot limits, and motion style. A single, latent-conditioned policy trained via imitation can compose low-level skills for downstream tasks, with safety constraints and better imitation quality.

Method: Train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through imitation using simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog motions. Extend the framework to handle constraints for safe deployment and integrate a diffusion discriminator to improve imitation quality. Use a latent space to control skill execution and apply the policy to loco-manipulation tasks on humanoid (H1) and quadruped (Solo12) robots, with evaluation in simulation and deployment on hardware.

Result: Verified loco-manipulation methods in simulation for H1 and Solo12; successfully deployed policies on Solo12 hardware; demonstrations and code/videos available.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient solving of downstream tasks by reusing a single, latent-controlled policy across diverse locomotion/manipulation skills, with constraint-aware deployment and real-world applicability demonstrated on multiple robots.

Abstract: Although humanoid and quadruped robots provide a wide range of capabilities,
current control methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Learning, focus mainly on
single skills. This approach is inefficient for solving more complicated tasks
where high-level goals, physical robot limitations and desired motion style
might all need to be taken into account. A more effective approach is to first
train a multipurpose motion policy that acquires low-level skills through
imitation, while providing latent space control over skill execution. Then,
this policy can be used to efficiently solve downstream tasks. This method has
already been successful for controlling characters in computer graphics. In
this work, we apply the approach to humanoid and quadrupedal loco-manipulation
by imitating either simple synthetic motions or kinematically retargeted dog
motions. We extend the original formulation to handle constraints, ensuring
deployment safety, and use a diffusion discriminator for better imitation
quality. We verify our methods by performing loco-manipulation in simulation
for the H1 humanoid and Solo12 quadruped, as well as deploying policies on
Solo12 hardware. Videos and code are available at

*Yue Su,Chubin Zhang,Sijin Chen,Liufan Tan,Yansong Tang,Jianan Wang,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cross-modal DSPv2 policy fuses 3D spatial and multi-view 2D semantic features to improve generalization and coherent control for whole-body mobile manipulation, extending Dense Policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization of robotic manipulation to diverse environments is hindered by processing complex observations, limited generalization, and incoherent actions.

Method: DSPv2 introduces an encoding scheme that aligns 3D spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features and extends the Dense Policy paradigm to whole-body mobile manipulation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method substantially outperforms existing approaches in task performance and generalization.

Conclusion: DSPv2 enables broad generalization while preserving fine-grained perception for precise control in whole-body mobile manipulation; a project page is provided.

Abstract: Learning whole-body mobile manipulation via imitation is essential for
generalizing robotic skills to diverse environments and complex tasks. However,
this goal is hindered by significant challenges, particularly in effectively
processing complex observation, achieving robust generalization, and generating
coherent actions. To address these issues, we propose DSPv2, a novel policy
architecture. DSPv2 introduces an effective encoding scheme that aligns 3D
spatial features with multi-view 2D semantic features. This fusion enables the
policy to achieve broad generalization while retaining the fine-grained
perception necessary for precise control. Furthermore, we extend the Dense
Policy paradigm to the whole-body mobile manipulation domain, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating coherent and precise actions for the whole-body
robotic platform. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both task performance and generalization
ability. Project page is available at: https://selen-suyue.github.io/DSPv2Net/.

### [149] [I-FailSense: Towards General Robotic Failure Detection with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16072)
*Clemence Grislain,Hamed Rahimi,Olivier Sigaud,Mohamed Chetouani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: I-FailSense is a post-trained VLM framework with lightweight failure-detection heads (FS blocks) attached to internal layers and an ensemble arbiter to detect semantic misalignment failures in language-conditioned robotic manipulation, using new datasets built from existing tasks; it generalizes to broader failures and transfers to other sims and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training, and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots guided by vision-language models often perform semantically meaningful actions that may still misalign with the given instruction; detecting such semantic misalignment failures is crucial for robust real-world deployment, but current VLMs lack reliable self-failure recognition.

Method: Create datasets focused on semantic misalignment using existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. Train a base VLM post-hoc, then attach lightweight classifiers (FS blocks) to different internal layers. Use ensembling to aggregate their predictions via a grounded arbitration mechanism. Evaluate against state-of-the-art VLMs, including comparable and larger models, and test generalization to broader failure categories, across simulation and real-world settings with zero-shot or minimal post-training.

Result: I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs of similar or larger size in semantic misalignment detection. It generalizes to broader failure categories and transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training.

Conclusion: A post-training, ensemble-based VLM with layer-attached failure-detection heads can effectively detect semantic misalignment in language-conditioned robotic manipulation, and the approach is generalizable and shareable via publicly released datasets and models.

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic manipulation in open-world settings requires not
only accurate task execution but also the ability to detect failures for robust
deployment in real-world environments. Although recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning
and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability
to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored
challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot
executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given
instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets
targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing
language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an
open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for
failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by
training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to
different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using
an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms
state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting
semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic
misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure
categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and
real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are
publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsteady aerodynamic effects substantially affect flight performance during agile maneuvers and in complex environments; enabling predictive, real-time reasoning is essential for robust performance.

Method: Employ a lightweight vortex particle model parallelized on GPUs; integrate with a sampling-based policy optimization framework; enable predictive reasoning and real-time replanning; validate in simulation and hardware.

Result: Replanning with the unsteady aero model yields improved performance of aggressive post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow disturbances.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of real-time planning and control that accounts for unsteady aerodynamics, enabling enhanced maneuverability in disturbed environments.

Abstract: Unsteady aerodynamic effects can have a profound impact on aerial vehicle
flight performance, especially during agile maneuvers and in complex
aerodynamic environments. In this paper, we present a real-time planning and
control approach capable of reasoning about unsteady aerodynamics. Our approach
relies on a lightweight vortex particle model, parallelized to allow GPU
acceleration, and a sampling-based policy optimization strategy capable of
leveraging the vortex particle model for predictive reasoning. We demonstrate,
through both simulation and hardware experiments, that by replanning with our
unsteady aerodynamics model, we can improve the performance of aggressive
post-stall maneuvers in the presence of unsteady environmental flow
disturbances.

*Carter Sifferman,Mohit Gupta,Michael Gleicher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Lightweight TOF-sensor based method to detect and localize objects near an arm-mounted sensor array by modeling robot-only measurements and flagging deviations, enabling collision avoidance and safer HRI with flexible sensor placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable object detection near a robot arm while avoiding self-detections from the arm body, and support flexible sensor placement to improve coverage and safety.

Method: Develop an empirical model of expected sensor measurements when the arm is alone; at runtime, compare observed raw TOF readings to the model to detect external objects; use multiple low-res sensors; localize objects along the length of the arm; evaluate across object types, positions, and ambient light; analyze performance limits.

Result: The approach can detect small nearby objects and localize their position along the arm with reasonable precision; robust to ambient light; computationally lightweight; classifies absence/presence effectively and supports better coverage through flexible sensor placement.

Conclusion: Useful for collision avoidance and safe human-robot interaction; practical for enhancing sensing around the arm; performance limited by fundamental measurement constraints and sensor noise; applicable across configurations with appropriate empirical modeling.

Abstract: We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm
using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using
arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external
objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a
computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight
information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight
sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the
presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in
proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common
sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor
placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a
radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm
and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to
reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to
object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors
on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has
potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe
human-robot interaction.

*Changwei Yao,Xinzi Liu,Chen Li,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RE-GoT is a bi-level framework that uses graph-of-thoughts and visual language models to automatically evolve reward functions for RL, outperforming prior LLM-based methods on RoboGen and ManiSkill2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating reward design is hard and error-prone; LLM-based reward design suffers from hallucinations, reliance on human feedback, and trouble with complex tasks. Integrating structured reasoning (graph-of-thoughts) and visual evaluation (VLMs) offers a scalable solution.

Method: Bi-level RE-GoT framework that decomposes tasks into text-attributed graphs for reasoning and reward generation, followed by iterative refinement of rewards using visual feedback from VLMs, without human intervention.

Result: On RoboGen (10 tasks) +32.25% average success, especially on multi-step tasks; on ManiSkill2 (4 tasks) average 93.73% success, surpassing prior LLM methods and even expert-designed rewards.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, VLMs, and graph-of-thoughts provides an effective, scalable approach to autonomous reward evolution in RL, enabling improved performance on complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and
iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations,
reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step
tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts
(RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured
graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for
automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into
text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function
generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from
VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4
ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing
LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates
by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2,
RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse
manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and
even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining
LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and
effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Hamiltonian-derived full-body dynamics model for fish swimming that treats a deformable, elastic body with fluid-structure interaction, enabling self-propelled motion without prescribed kinematics. A preliminary parametric study reveals trade-offs between tail-beat frequency, speed, and energy efficiency, with optimal body stiffness and length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate, interpretable, and computationally tractable models to guide design/optimization of soft robotic fish and to illuminate biological propulsion mechanisms, avoiding reliance on prescribed kinematics.

Method: Derivation from Hamilton's principle for a continuously distributed elastic body with fluid-structure coupling, yielding a self-propelled swimming model without prescribed motions. A preliminary parameter study explores actuation frequency, body stiffness, and body length and their effects on speed and cost of transport (COT) via simulations.

Result: The model shows opposing trends between swimming speed and energy efficiency with tail-beat frequency; both body stiffness and body length exhibit distinct optimal values for performance.

Conclusion: A rigorous, interpretable full-body dynamics framework for fish-like swimmers that supports design optimization and offers insights into biological propulsion, informing the development of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

Abstract: Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research
communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled
by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design
optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and
computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is
indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish
swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the
continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large
deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling
self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter
study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on
swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that
swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat
frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal
values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and
inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ACDC enables autonomous drone cinematography driven by natural language using LLMs and VFMs to convert prompts into indoor UAV tours; it uses a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization to refine poses with aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner for safe quadrotor trajectories; validated in simulation and hardware-in-the-loop; does not require robotics/cinematography expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drone cinematography workflows rely on manual selection of waypoints/view angles based on predefined intents, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. There is a need to bridge open-vocabulary natural language with autonomous aerial cinematography.

Method: Employ large language models and vision foundation models to translate free-form prompts into executable indoor UAV video tours. The pipeline includes a vision-language retrieval module for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization loop to refine poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner to generate safe quadrotor trajectories.

Result: The system robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes in both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, without requiring robotics or cinematography expertise.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography and presents an end-to-end NL-to-action pipeline for drone cinematography.

Abstract: We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic
Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by
natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main
limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require
manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent,
which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we
propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models
(VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable
indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language
retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian
optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a
motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC
through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating
that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor
scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results
highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from
open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-phase neural algorithmic reasoner for Knapsack uses dynamic-programming (DP) supervision: first build a DP table, then reconstruct the solution, and this DP-guided approach generalizes better to larger instances than a direct-prediction baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close a gap in neural algorithmic reasoning by tackling a pseudo-polynomial problem (Knapsack) and showing that integrating classical DP structure with neural models improves generalization beyond existing NAR benchmarks that omit such problems.

Method: A two-phase pipeline: (1) construct the DP table for Knapsack, (2) reconstruct the solution from the DP table. The model explicitly represents intermediate DP states and is trained with dynamic-programming supervision to mimic the DP computation, rather than only predicting the final subset.

Result: The DP-supervised, two-phase approach generalizes better to larger Knapsack instances than a direct-prediction baseline that selects a subset solely from problem inputs.

Conclusion: Incorporating algorithmic structure via DP-state modeling and a two-phase reasoning pipeline improves neural algorithmic reasoning on Knapsack, demonstrating the value of DP supervision for pseudo-polynomial problems and suggesting broader applicability to similar algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is a growing field that aims to embed
algorithmic logic into neural networks by imitating classical algorithms. In
this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic
reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging
classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard
NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow
the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first
constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution
from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic
programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem
instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal
subset only from the problem inputs.

TL;DR: Meta RL for traffic signal control (MetaLight) can help under some conditions but is not consistently robust across scenarios, with errors up to ~22%, raising reliability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability problem of RL-based traffic signal control under non-stationary input distributions caused by changing traffic patterns by evaluating a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach (MetaLight).

Method: Empirical evaluation of MetaLight on traffic signal control tasks, assessing performance under varying distribution shifts and measuring reliability/robustness, including error rates.

Result: MetaLight provides reasonably good results under certain conditions but can perform poorly under others, with errors observed up to 22%, indicating limited robustness.

Conclusion: Meta RL schemes like MetaLight may not be reliably deployable for traffic signal control in their current form; further work is needed to improve robustness to distribution shifts or to complement Meta RL with additional strategies.

Abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart
transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years.
Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to
be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using
Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the
trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input
data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This
presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of
AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if
a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address
this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement
Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we
evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and
show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to
reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well
(with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not
robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated, low-overhead pipeline for literature reviews using transformer embeddings and cosine similarity to generate keywords, fetch relevant papers from open-access sources, and rank them by semantic distance; three embedding models are evaluated and a statistical thresholding step filters results, showing promise for scalable preliminary research without ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, low-effort literature reviews that maintain relevance, addressing the overhead of traditional systematic reviews and the rigidity of optimization-based methods while leveraging semantic similarity.

Method: Input consists of a paper title and abstract. The pipeline generates keywords, fetches relevant open-access papers, and ranks them by semantic similarity to the input using transformer-based embeddings (three models). A statistical thresholding approach filters the results to keep relevant papers, producing a streamlined literature review process without reliance on ground-truth relevance labels.

Result: The approach yields a scalable and practical tool for preliminary research and exploratory analysis, showing promise even in the absence of ground-truth relevance labels.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline demonstrates potential as a practical, low-overhead literature review tool; future work could enhance evaluation against ground-truth labels, optimize thresholding, and incorporate user feedback to refine relevance judgments.

Abstract: We propose an automated pipeline for performing literature reviews using
semantic similarity. Unlike traditional systematic review systems or
optimization based methods, this work emphasizes minimal overhead and high
relevance by using transformer based embeddings and cosine similarity. By
providing a paper title and abstract, it generates relevant keywords, fetches
relevant papers from open access repository, and ranks them based on their
semantic closeness to the input. Three embedding models were evaluated. A
statistical thresholding approach is then applied to filter relevant papers,
enabling an effective literature review pipeline. Despite the absence of
heuristic feedback or ground truth relevance labels, the proposed system shows
promise as a scalable and practical tool for preliminary research and
exploratory analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can hallucinate by letting internal knowledge override evidence when generating formal models from data; the study proposes a controlled evaluation to measure fidelity to provided evidence and to assess reliability in evidence-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address knowledge-driven hallucination in LLMs and its impact on evidence-based artifacts; BPM is a suitable domain due to standardized patterns and available schemas.

Method: Conduct a controlled experiment with deliberate conflicts between source artifacts and the LLM's background knowledge; use inputs describing both standard and deliberately atypical process structures to measure fidelity to the provided evidence; develop a methodology for evaluating reliability of AI-generated BPM artifacts.

Result: Demonstrates that knowledge-driven hallucination can occur and provides a replicable evaluation framework for assessing LLM fidelity to evidence; highlights the need for rigorous validation when AI outputs intersect with evidence-based domains.

Conclusion: Rigorous validation of AI-generated artifacts is essential in evidence-based domains; the paper provides a methodology to assess reliability and raises awareness of knowledge-driven hallucination risks in BPM and similar tasks.

Abstract: The utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analytical tasks is rooted in
their vast pre-trained knowledge, which allows them to interpret ambiguous
inputs and infer missing information. However, this same capability introduces
a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon
where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is
overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper
investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated
process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model
from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)
provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes
follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong
pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to
create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the
LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and
deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the
provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical
reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of
AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework to diagnose and transfer expert behavior into LLM-powered agents using curated golds, mutation-generated silvers, and an LLM Agent Judge, with a vectorized map to propagate improvements across systems; demonstrated on a recruiter-assistant multi-agent setup to uncover cognitive failures and drive expert-like reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit stochastic, multi-step decision making; traditional static evaluations fail to diagnose and improve agentic behavior. There is a need for standardized, reusable expert behavior transfer to enhance reliability and performance of tool-augmented agents.

Method: 1) Curated golden datasets of expert annotations; 2) Silver datasets generated by controlled behavioural mutation; 3) An LLM-based Agent Judge that scores performance and prescribes targeted improvements; 4) Embedding prescriptions into a vectorized recommendation map to propagate improvements across system instances; 5) Empirical demonstration on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, identifying biases, extraction drift, and tool misrouting, while guiding agents toward expert-level reasoning and style.

Result: The framework uncovers latent cognitive failures and successfully steers agents toward expert-level reasoning and stylistic alignment; it enables standardized, reproducible transfer of expert behaviour in stochastic, tool-augmented LLM agents.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for moving from static evaluation to active expert-system refinement, enabling scalable transfer of expert behavior and improvement propagation across multiple LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of neural architectures - from multilayer perceptrons to
large-scale Transformer-based models - has enabled language models (LLMs) to
exhibit emergent agentic behaviours when equipped with memory, planning, and
external tool use. However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step
decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for
diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for
expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of
expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated
golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through
controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores
and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a
vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as
reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We
demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing
that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing,
extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents
toward expert-level reasoning and style. The results establish a foundation for
standardized, reproducible expert behaviour transfer in stochastic,
tool-augmented LLM agents, moving beyond static evaluation to active expert
system refinement.

TL;DR: FragmentRetro uses BRICS/r-BRICS fragmentation with stock-aware exploration and fingerprint screening to achieve quadratic retrosynthesis scaling (O(h^2)) and provide fragment-based starting solutions, offering a scalable foundation for CASP while not delivering full reaction pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-search retrosynthesis faces exponential complexity; there is a need for principled, scalable methods and a formal computational analysis to understand where improvements can come from.

Method: Fragmentation via BRICS and r-BRICS; stock-aware assembly and pattern fingerprint screening; recursive fragmentation and verification against building-block stock; outputs fragment-combination solutions; includes a formal complexity analysis.

Result: Demonstrates O(h^2) complexity; high solved rates on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, natural products; competitive runtime; can solve cases where traditional tree search fails; fingerprint screening reduces substructure matching complexity.

Conclusion: FragmentRetro offers quadratic scaling and serves as a foundational component for scalable, automated synthesis planning; focuses on fragment-based solutions rather than full pathways; promising for integration into broader CASP pipelines.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler
precursors, is crucial for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). Widely
adopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic
method that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS,
combined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to
achieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular
fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets
of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first
formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree
search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as
$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number
of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree
search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate
that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime,
including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint
screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity. While
FragmentRetro focuses on efficiently identifying fragment-based solutions
rather than full reaction pathways, its computational advantages and ability to
generate strategic starting candidates establish it as a powerful foundational
component for scalable and automated synthesis planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes anti-scheming evaluations for AI, showing deliberative alignment reduces overt covert actions but doesn't eradicate them; situational awareness influences results; calls for further mitigation research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risk that capable AIs may secretly pursue misaligned goals (scheming) and hide it, requiring specialized evaluation and mitigation beyond standard ML.

Method: Define covert actions, evaluate anti-scheming via tests on far out-of-distribution tasks; 26 OOD evaluations across 180+ environments; stress-test deliberative alignment; analyze role of chain-of-thought; assess robustness to pre-trained hidden goals; red-teaming.

Result: Deliberative alignment reduces covert-action rates from 13% to 0.4% but does not fully eliminate them; can largely stop previously trained hidden goals; residual misbehavior found after red-teaming; CoT awareness correlates with reduced covert actions; intuition that situational awareness partly drives reductions.

Conclusion: Need further alignment mitigations and robust assessment methods; findings may be confounded by situational awareness; limitations include reliance on human-legible CoT and English reasoning; does not address deceptive alignment; calls for continued research into anti-scheming.

Abstract: Highly capable AI systems could secretly pursue misaligned goals -- what we
call "scheming". Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its
misaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires
different strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing
anti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme
on far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming
is driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to
pre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of "covert actions" --
such as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as
a proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then
stress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26
OOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert
action rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our
mitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal
previously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after
additional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often
demonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal
evidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness
increases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in
covert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.
While we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational
awareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to
rely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard
English. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and
their assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,
which this paper does not address.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based MicroRCA-Agent fuses log parsing, anomaly detection, and two-stage reasoning across node-service-pod hierarchies for scalable root-cause localization in microservice faults; demonstrates strong results and code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalable, accurate root-cause analysis in complex microservice environments with massive multimodal data, enabling automated, explainable fault localization.

Method: 1) Drain log parsing combined with a multi-level data filtering mechanism to compress massive logs into high-quality fault features; 2) dual anomaly detection using Isolation Forest (unsupervised) with status-code validation for comprehensive trace anomaly identification; 3) statistical symmetry ratio filtering with a two-stage LLM analysis to summarize full-stack phenomena across node-service-pod hierarchies; 4) a multimodal analysis module using cross-modal prompts to fuse anomaly information and produce structured results (fault components, root cause descriptions, reasoning traces); 5) ablation studies to validate the value of each modality; 6) evaluation showing superiority in complex microservice fault scenarios with a final score of 50.71; 7) code released at the GitHub repository.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault scenarios, with a final evaluation score of 50.71 and evidence from ablation studies validating the contribution of each data modality; code and methodology are publicly released for reproduction.

Conclusion: MicroRCA-Agent presents an effective, multimodal, LLM-assisted framework for microservice root-cause analysis, integrating log parsing, anomaly detection, and cross-modal reasoning to generate structured, traceable fault analyses and explanations; validated by ablations and a public code release.

Abstract: This paper presents MicroRCA-Agent, an innovative solution for microservice
root cause analysis based on large language model agents, which constructs an
intelligent fault root cause localization system with multimodal data fusion.
The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine
the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering
mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault
features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates
Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation
to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a
statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM
analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across
node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module
leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal
anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical
reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis
results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning
trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each
modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed
solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault
scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71. The code has been released at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces CCrepair dataset and RL-based compilation repair framework with LLM-judge evaluation; smaller model rivals a larger one.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of large-scale, high-fidelity datasets and the limitations of supervised approaches in producing semantically correct patches.

Method: Build a generate-and-verify dataset (CCrepair); apply reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward that emphasizes semantic quality over mere compilability; implement a robust two-stage evaluation using an LLM-as-a-Judge validated against human experts.

Result: RL-trained model (Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) achieves performance comparable to a much larger model (Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct), indicating efficiency of the training paradigm; provides a substantial dataset and paradigm for future research.

Conclusion: Offers a valuable dataset and a more effective training/evaluation paradigm for robust compilation repair models, advancing practical automated programming assistants.

Abstract: The automated repair of C++ compilation errors presents a significant
challenge, the resolution of which is critical for developer productivity.
Progress in this domain is constrained by two primary factors: the scarcity of
large-scale, high-fidelity datasets and the limitations of conventional
supervised methods, which often fail to generate semantically correct
patches.This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive
framework with three core contributions. First, we present CCrepair, a novel,
large-scale C++ compilation error dataset constructed through a sophisticated
generate-and-verify pipeline. Second, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
paradigm guided by a hybrid reward signal, shifting the focus from mere
compilability to the semantic quality of the fix. Finally, we establish the
robust, two-stage evaluation system providing this signal, centered on an
LLM-as-a-Judge whose reliability has been rigorously validated against the
collective judgments of a panel of human experts. This integrated approach
aligns the training objective with generating high-quality, non-trivial patches
that are both syntactically and semantically correct. The effectiveness of our
approach was demonstrated experimentally. Our RL-trained Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
model achieved performance comparable to a Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model,
validating the efficiency of our training paradigm. Our work provides the
research community with a valuable new dataset and a more effective paradigm
for training and evaluating robust compilation repair models, paving the way
for more practical and reliable automated programming assistants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of RPA and ML integration; introduces a taxonomy with two meta-characteristics (RPA-ML integration, RPA-ML interaction) and eight dimensions to guide intelligent RPA design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RPA's symbolic nature limits capabilities; ML-enabled RPA can automate more complex tasks.

Method: Literature review and taxonomy development, organizing the intelligent RPA concept.

Result: A taxonomy comprising two meta-characteristics and eight dimensions.

Conclusion: The taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding and developing intelligent RPA and guiding future research and practice.

Abstract: Robotic process automation (RPA) is a lightweight approach to automating
business processes using software robots that emulate user actions at the
graphical user interface level. While RPA has gained popularity for its
cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its
symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks
currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling
intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable
tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections
between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA
into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML
integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions:
architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and
technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle
phase, and user-robot relation.

TL;DR: ApiNATOMY provides a topological/semantic framework for multiscale physiological circuit maps, integrating KR and KM tools and external ontologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers require a scalable way to map data for the nervous system and other physiological systems in relation to the organs studied.

Method: Developed ApiNATOMY: a framework combining a Knowledge Representation (KR) model to capture interactions among anatomical entities with Knowledge Management (KM) tools to convert abstractions into detailed, ontology-integrated models.

Result: A functional infrastructure enabling representation and integration of physiological networks, supporting external ontologies and knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The KR+KM approach enables efficient capture of domain knowledge and scalable model development for physiological circuits.

Abstract: We are developing infrastructure to support researchers in mapping data
related to the peripheral nervous system and other physiological systems, with
an emphasis on their relevance to the organs under investigation. The nervous
system, a complex network of nerves and ganglia, plays a critical role in
coordinating and transmitting signals throughout the body. To aid in this, we
have created ApiNATOMY, a framework for the topological and semantic
representation of multiscale physiological circuit maps. ApiNATOMY integrates a
Knowledge Representation (KR) model and a suite of Knowledge Management (KM)
tools. The KR model enables physiology experts to easily capture interactions
between anatomical entities, while the KM tools help modelers convert
high-level abstractions into detailed models of physiological processes, which
can be integrated with external ontologies and knowledge graphs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fully automated framework (CLIMB) builds high-quality, region-aware occupation taxonomies from raw job postings using global semantic clustering and a reflection-based multi-agent system, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual taxonomy curation is slow, and current automated methods are either top-down and not adaptive to dynamic regional markets or bottom-up struggle to form coherent hierarchies from noisy data. There is a need for robust, scalable, data-driven taxonomies for jobs.

Method: CLIMB combines global semantic clustering to distill core occupations with a reflection-based multi-agent system that iteratively constructs a coherent hierarchy from raw job postings.

Result: On three real-world datasets, CLIMB yields more coherent and scalable taxonomies than baselines and captures unique regional characteristics; code and datasets are released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: CLIMB enables automated, robust, and regionally aware occupation taxonomies suitable for job recommendation and labor market intelligence, advancing data-driven taxonomy construction from noisy job postings.

Abstract: Creating robust occupation taxonomies, vital for applications ranging from
job recommendation to labor market intelligence, is challenging. Manual
curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to
dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies
from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent
taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of
high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global
semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a
reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy.
On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies
that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully
capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at

*Giovanni De Gasperis,Sante Dino Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparative study of rule-based vs. data-driven approaches in industrial monitoring; proposes a hybrid framework and argues for synergistic intelligent systems in Industry 4.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Industry 4.0, industrial monitoring must balance interpretability, safety, and adaptability; traditional rule-based systems lack scalability while data-driven models face explainability and integration challenges.

Method: Comparative analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and application scenarios; proposes a basic evaluation framework for key properties; discusses potential hybrid solutions and strategic direction.

Result: Rule-based systems: high interpretability, deterministic behavior, and ease of implementation in stable, regulated contexts; limitations in scalability and performance under evolving conditions. Data-driven systems: strong in anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and adaptation to new conditions; challenges include data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. Hybrid approaches that combine rule-based transparency with machine learning power are promising.

Conclusion: Future industrial monitoring should leverage synergistic systems that fuse expert knowledge with data-driven insights to enhance resilience, efficiency, and trust in smart, flexible environments.

Abstract: Industrial monitoring systems, especially when deployed in Industry 4.0
environments, are experiencing a shift in paradigm from traditional rule-based
architectures to data-driven approaches leveraging machine learning and
artificial intelligence. This study presents a comparison between these two
methodologies, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, and
application scenarios, and proposes a basic framework to evaluate their key
properties. Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic
behavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal
for regulated industries and safety-critical applications. However, they face
challenges with scalability, adaptability, and performance in complex or
evolving contexts. Conversely, data-driven systems excel in detecting hidden
anomalies, enabling predictive maintenance and dynamic adaptation to new
conditions. Despite their high accuracy, these models face challenges related
to data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. The paper
suggests hybrid solutions as a possible promising direction, combining the
transparency of rule-based logic with the analytical power of machine learning.
Our hypothesis is that the future of industrial monitoring lies in intelligent,
synergic systems that leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.
This dual approach enhances resilience, operational efficiency, and trust,
paving the way for smarter and more flexible industrial environments.

TL;DR: An LLM connected to an EHR via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinical data in a real hospital, achieving near-perfect accuracy on simple tasks but facing challenges with time-dependent complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable secure, scalable integration of LLMs with hospital EHRs by providing MCP-based tool access, enabling hospital AI agents to retrieve data for clinical tasks.

Method: Developed EHR-MCP framework with custom MCP tools linked to the hospital EHR; used GPT-4.1 with LangGraph ReAct to perform six use-case tasks; retrospective analysis of eight ICT-discussed patients; measured agreement with physician gold standards.

Result: LLM consistently selected and executed correct MCP tools; near-perfect accuracy on most tasks; reduced performance on the complex time-dependent task; errors mostly from incorrect arguments or misinterpreting tool outputs; long responses risked exceeding context window.

Conclusion: LLMs can retrieve clinical data via MCP in real hospital settings; EHR-MCP provides secure, consistent data access; potential foundation for hospital AI agents; future work requires extending beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation, and evaluating clinical impact.

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their
deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health
record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration
between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP
can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital
setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated
with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct
agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the
infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were
retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was
measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.
Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was
lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors
arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses
from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding
the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a
real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while
highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for
secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI
agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,
and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of
generative AI into clinical practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight method augments text prompts with tuple-based structured information generated by a fine-tuned language model, improving spatial accuracy in text-to-image generation without sacrificing overall image quality; automatically produced tuples rival human-crafted ones and offer a portable solution to better encode spatial relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing spatial relationships described in natural language prompts is a key bottleneck in T2I generation. Prior approaches (prompt optimization, spatial grounding, semantic refinement) have limitations in versatility and practicality. A lightweight, portable mechanism to encode spatial constraints directly into prompts could permanently improve fidelity.

Method: Fine-tune a language model to automatically convert prompts into tuple-based structured information and seamlessly inject this information into existing T2I pipelines, enabling prompt augmentation without major architectural changes.

Result: Significant gains in spatial accuracy without reducing overall image quality, as measured by Inception Score. The automatically generated tuples achieve quality comparable to human-crafted tuples.

Conclusion: Structured, tuple-based prompt information is a practical and portable means to enhance spatial relationships in T2I generation, addressing a key limitation of current large-scale generative systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has advanced rapidly, yet faithfully capturing
spatial relationships described in natural language prompts remains a major
challenge. Prior efforts have addressed this issue through prompt optimization,
spatially grounded generation, and semantic refinement. This work introduces a
lightweight approach that augments prompts with tuple-based structured
information, using a fine-tuned language model for automatic conversion and
seamless integration into T2I pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spatial accuracy, without compromising overall
image quality as measured by Inception Score. Furthermore, the automatically
generated tuples exhibit quality comparable to human-crafted tuples. This
structured information provides a practical and portable solution to enhance
spatial relationships in T2I generation, addressing a key limitation of current
large-scale generative systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASAC integrates Attention Schema Theory-inspired attention control into neural networks, using a VQVAE-based attention abstractor/controller within transformers to explicitly model and manage attention, yielding faster learning, higher accuracy, and improved robustness and transfer learning across vision and NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explicitly model and allocate attention in AI systems inspired by cognitive science (AST), aiming to improve learning efficiency, robustness, and generalization while reducing attention waste in large models.

Method: Insert an ASAC module into transformer architectures. Use a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQVAE) as both attention abstractor and controller to classify and direct attention. Evaluate across vision and NLP tasks, including image classification with vision transformers on multiple datasets, assess learning speed, robustness to noise and out-of-distribution data, multi-task performance, adversarial resilience, and transfer learning.

Result: ASAC improves classification accuracy and accelerates learning in vision transformers, demonstrates robustness to noisy and OOD data, enhances multi-task performance, and shows resilience to adversarial perturbations and efficient transfer learning.

Conclusion: Attention-schema-based attention control is a viable approach to improve AI efficiency and generalization, bridging cognitive science and ML; explicit attention modeling can boost performance across domains with potential for more energy-efficient, robust AI systems.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become integral in AI, significantly enhancing
model performance and scalability by drawing inspiration from human cognition.
Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits
that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention
itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we
introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the
attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial
experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer
architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise
attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach
aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both
the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification
accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision
transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller
not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization
capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we
have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments
reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to
adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and
facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These
promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine
learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms
in AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prompt-based unlearning framework embeds removability into the model by tying class semantics to dedicated prompt tokens; removing the prompts forgets those classes instantly without retraining or data access, while preserving performance on retained classes and offering privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing regulatory demands (e.g., GDPR) require unlearning or deletion of user data. Traditional unlearning (retraining, activation editing, distillation) is costly, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or continually evolving systems. The paper argues for built-in unlearning as a design principle.

Method: Bind class-level semantics to dedicated prompt tokens within a single training phase (prompt-based learning). Knowledge is encoded in prompts rather than weights; removing the relevant prompts instantly unlearns the corresponding classes without retraining or accessing original data.

Result: Experiments show retained-class performance ~unchanged while forgotten classes are erased; framework provides strong privacy and security guarantees: resistant to membership inference attacks and prompt removal prevents residual knowledge extraction under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: Embedding removability into the architecture enables modular, scalable, and ethically responsible AI models, suitable for deployment in sensitive and regulated environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel multi-scale graph neural process (MPNP-DDI) for drug–drug interaction prediction that learns multi-scale molecular representations via iterative message passing, fuses them with cross-drug co-attention, and estimates uncertainty through an integrated neural process, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for pharmacovigilance and precision medicine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current DDI prediction methods in capturing structural information across scales (local functional groups to global topology) and in quantifying prediction confidence.

Method: Develop a multi-scale GNN framework with an iterative message-passing scheme to build a hierarchy of representations at multiple scales. Introduce a cross-drug co-attention mechanism to fuse multi-scale representations for interacting drug pairs. Integrate a neural process module to provide principled uncertainty estimation for predictions.

Result: Empirical results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets, with accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware drug–drug interaction predictions.

Conclusion: MPNP-DDI delivers accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions leveraging multi-scale structural features, offering a powerful tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision medicine.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is crucial for medication
safety and effective drug development. However, existing methods often struggle
to capture structural information across different scales, from local
functional groups to global molecular topology, and typically lack mechanisms
to quantify prediction confidence. To address these limitations, we propose
MPNP-DDI, a novel Multi-scale Graph Neural Process framework. The core of
MPNP-DDI is a unique message-passing scheme that, by being iteratively applied,
learns a hierarchy of graph representations at multiple scales. Crucially, a
cross-drug co-attention mechanism then dynamically fuses these multi-scale
representations to generate context-aware embeddings for interacting drug
pairs, while an integrated neural process module provides principled
uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNP-DDI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. By
providing accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware predictions built upon
multi-scale structural features, MPNP-DDI represents a powerful computational
tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision
medicine.

*Zheng Yang,Guoxuan Chi,Chenshu Wu,Hanyu Liu,Yuchong Gao,Yunhao Liu,Jie Xu,Tony Xiao Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey on integrating Generative AI into wireless sensing, detailing integration modes, generative models, applications, challenges, and a path toward a wireless foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI has shown strong data-synthesis capabilities in CV/NLP. Applying it to wireless sensing can improve data augmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, boosting tasks like device localization, activity recognition, and environmental monitoring. A unified, scalable foundation model for wireless sensing is desirable.

Method: Literature survey that (1) analyzes two integration modes—plugin (augmenting task-specific models) and solver (directly addressing sensing tasks); (2) reviews mainstream generative models (GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) and their applicability to sensing tasks; (3) identifies challenges and outlines directions toward a wireless foundation model.

Result: Provides a structured synthesis and taxonomy of how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing, clarifying when to use which model and integration approach across tasks; highlights key challenges (data privacy, data scarcity, computation, edge deployment) and offers design considerations and criteria for choosing methods; advocates a future wireless foundation model for scalable, adaptable signal understanding.

Conclusion: The work argues for a unified, pre-trained wireless foundation model that can generalize across sensing tasks with efficient adaptation and deployment, outlining a roadmap for scalable, cross-task signal understanding in wireless sensing.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant advancements
in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP),
demonstrating its capability to synthesize high-fidelity data and improve
generalization. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating GenAI
into wireless sensing systems. By leveraging generative techniques such as data
augmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, wireless sensing applications,
including device localization, human activity recognition, and environmental
monitoring, can be significantly improved. This survey investigates the
convergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives.
First, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines,
focusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific
models and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze
the characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion
models, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various
wireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to
wireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation
model: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and
efficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.

### [175] [IEFS-GMB: Gradient Memory Bank-Guided Feature Selection Based on Information Entropy for EEG Classification of Neurological Disorders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15259)
*Liang Zhang,Hanyang Dong,Jia-Hong Gao,Yi Sun,Kuntao Xiao,Wanli Yang,Zhao Lv,Shurong Sheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IEFS-GMB applies information-entropy-based feature selection guided by a Gradient Memory Bank to EEG data, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, and outperforming baseline feature-selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals have low signal-to-noise ratio, making robust feature selection essential. Existing FS methods are often architecture-dependent, lack interpretability, and are not robust to variability due to single-iteration data.

Method: Introduce a dynamic Gradient Memory Bank that stores historical gradients. Compute feature importance using information entropy across gradients and apply entropy-based weighting to select informative EEG features, integrated into neural encoders. Evaluated on four public neurological datasets.

Result: Encoders with IEFS-GMB show accuracy gains of 0.64% to 6.45% over baselines and outperform four competing FS techniques; also improves model interpretability.

Conclusion: IEFS-GMB offers a robust, interpretable EEG feature-selection framework that enhances diagnostic performance and is suitable for clinical settings due to its robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based EEG classification is crucial for the automated detection
of neurological disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
intervention. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits
model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing
representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are
seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent
and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on
single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To
address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature
Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a
dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance
via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select
informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease
datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy
improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also
outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability,
supporting its practical use in clinical settings.

### [176] [A Weak Supervision Approach for Monitoring Recreational Drug Use Effects in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15266)
*Lucía Prieto-Santamaría,Alba Cortés Iglesias,Claudio Vidal Giné,Fermín Fernández Calderón,Óscar M. Lozano,Alejandro Rodríguez-González*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twitter-based extraction of reported effects for ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B; 92k tweets identified and weakly labeled for polarity; ML classifiers with cost-sensitive learning; best F1 0.885 and AUPRC 0.934; demonstrates potential for real-time pharmacovigilance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health surveillance often underrepresents user experiences; social media offers unfiltered, real-world reports of drug effects. Studying three emerging psychoactives (ecstasy, GHB, 2C-B) via Twitter may reveal substance-specific phenotypes and polarity of reported effects.

Method: Create a slang term list; apply MetaMap to extract biomedical concepts from tweets; weakly annotate tweets with polarity using an expert-guided heuristic; perform descriptive and comparative analyses of phenotypic outcomes across substances; train multiple ML classifiers to predict polarity, addressing class imbalance with cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling (e.g., SMOTE); evaluate on a held-out test set; identify top model.

Result: Identified and weakly annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B; each tweet labeled with polarity (positive/negative) via expert-guided heuristic; descriptive and comparative analyses conducted; multiple classifiers trained; best performance achieved with eXtreme Gradient Boosting incorporating cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934) on the test set.

Conclusion: Twitter-based signals can reveal substance-specific phenotypic effects and enable real-time pharmacovigilance; polarity classification models can characterize drug effects with high accuracy, supporting rapid monitoring of emerging psychoactive substances.

Abstract: Understanding the real-world effects of recreational drug use remains a
critical challenge in public health and biomedical research, especially as
traditional surveillance systems often underrepresent user experiences. In this
study, we leverage social media (specifically Twitter) as a rich and unfiltered
source of user-reported effects associated with three emerging psychoactive
substances: ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. By combining a curated list of slang terms
with biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap, we identified and weakly
annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning these substances. Each tweet was
labeled with a polarity reflecting whether it reported a positive or negative
effect, following an expert-guided heuristic process. We then performed
descriptive and comparative analyses of the reported phenotypic outcomes across
substances and trained multiple machine learning classifiers to predict
polarity from tweet content, accounting for strong class imbalance using
techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The top
performance on the test set was obtained from eXtreme Gradient Boosting with
cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934). Our findings reveal that
Twitter enables the detection of substance-specific phenotypic effects, and
that polarity classification models can support real-time pharmacovigilance and
drug effect characterization with high accuracy.

*Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Represents Transformer components as a directed, weighted graph to track causal influence during LLM training; reveals progression through exploration, consolidation, and refinement, with a stable hierarchy of information spreaders and dynamic information gatherers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how complex capabilities emerge in LLMs during training through a macro-level lens, using Complex Network Theory (CNT) to characterize learning dynamics at the component level.

Method: Build a directed, weighted graph where nodes are attention heads and MLPs; edges encode causal influence measured via intervention-based ablation. Track the graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on an induction task and analyze graph-theoretic metrics to characterize the evolution.

Result: The component-graph evolves through distinct phases (exploration, consolidation, refinement). A stable hierarchy of information spreader components emerges, while information gatherer components form a dynamic, reconfiguring set at key learning junctures.

Conclusion: A CNT-based component-network perspective provides a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and understanding the self-organizing principles that shape the formation of functional circuits in LLMs during training.

Abstract: The process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire complex
capabilities during training remains a key open question in mechanistic
interpretability. This project investigates whether these learning dynamics can
be characterized through the lens of Complex Network Theory (CNT). I introduce
a novel methodology to represent a Transformer-based LLM as a directed,
weighted graph where nodes are the model's computational components (attention
heads and MLPs) and edges represent causal influence, measured via an
intervention-based ablation technique. By tracking the evolution of this
component-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a
canonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The
results reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of
exploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the
emergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a
dynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key
learning junctures. This work demonstrates that a component-level network
perspective offers a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and
understanding the self-organizing principles that drive the formation of
functional circuits in LLMs.

*Giacomo Dall'Olio,Rainer Kolisch,Yaoxin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-guided partial column generation using graph neural networks to predict which pricing problems yield negative reduced cost improves exact solution of team formation and routing, especially on hard instances with time limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational effort in column generation for team formation and routing by selecting pricing problems to solve using a predictive model, addressing the combinatorial difficulty and multiple pricing problems.

Method: Proposes a novel partial column generation strategy; builds a graph neural network model tailored to the team formation and routing problem to predict negative reduced cost columns among multiple pricing problems; integrates predictions to guide pricing.

Result: Computational experiments show enhanced solution method and outperform traditional partial column generation approaches, particularly on hard instances under tight time limits.

Conclusion: Graph neural network-guided partial column generation is effective for team formation and routing, offering practical gains in solution quality and time performance.

Abstract: The team formation and routing problem is a challenging optimization problem
with several real-world applications in fields such as airport, healthcare, and
maintenance operations. To solve this problem, exact solution methods based on
column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple
pricing problems, based on predicting which ones are likely to yield columns
with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to
the team formation and routing problem that leverages graph neural networks for
these predictions. Computational experiments demonstrate that applying our
strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial
column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard
instances solved under a tight time limit.

*Chi Liu,Derek Li,Yan Shu,Robin Chen,Derek Duan,Teng Fang,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fleming-R1 introduces verifiable medical reasoning using a triad of innovations: Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start, and a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). It delivers strong parameter-efficient performance across benchmarks and is publicly released for safer, auditable medical AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between model accuracy and the ability to provide transparent, verifiable reasoning in high-stakes medical AI. The work aims to enable expert-level clinical reasoning with auditable inference processes, addressing safety, trust, and generalization concerns in medical applications.

Method: 1) RODS: combine curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning; 2) CoT cold start: distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models to establish robust inference priors; 3) RLVR: a two-stage reinforcement learning framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization with adaptive hard-sample mining to consolidate core reasoning skills and address persistent failure modes.

Result: Across medical benchmarks, the 7B Fleming-R1 variant outperforms many larger baselines; the 32B model approaches GPT-4o parity and consistently beats strong open-source systems. The approach yields notable parameter-efficient gains and robust reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can push clinical reasoning beyond mere accuracy optimization. The authors publicly release Fleming-R1 to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI and safer deployment in high-stakes clinical settings.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple
accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment
in high-stakes clinical environments.

*Giorgos Armeniakos,Theodoros Mantzakidis,Dimitrios Soudris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid unary-binary architecture for printed-electronics ML classifiers enabling multiplier-less MLP execution, achieving substantial area and power reductions with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Printed electronics offer low-cost fabrication but large feature sizes constrain classifier complexity; the work seeks encoder-free, efficient designs tailored to ML models to leverage PE advantages without sacrificing performance.

Method: Proposes a hybrid unary-binary arithmetic architecture that removes encoders and enables multiplier-less execution of MLP classifiers, and introduces architecture-aware training to boost efficiency.

Result: Evaluated on six datasets; average reductions of 46% in area and 39% in power with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming state-of-the-art MLP designs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that PE-based ML hardware can achieve strong area/power efficiency with encoder-free, multiplier-less designs and architecture-aware training, underscoring PE's viability for ML applications.

Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) provide a flexible, cost-efficient alternative to
silicon for implementing machine learning (ML) circuits, but their large
feature sizes limit classifier complexity. Leveraging PE's low fabrication and
NRE costs, designers can tailor hardware to specific ML models, simplifying
circuit design. This work explores alternative arithmetic and proposes a hybrid
unary-binary architecture that removes costly encoders and enables efficient,
multiplier-less execution of MLP classifiers. We also introduce
architecture-aware training to further improve area and power efficiency.
Evaluation on six datasets shows average reductions of 46% in area and 39% in
power, with minimal accuracy loss, surpassing other state-of-the-art MLP
designs.

### [181] [Kuramoto Orientation Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15328)
*Yue Song,T. Anderson Keller,Sevan Brodjian,Takeru Miyato,Yisong Yue,Pietro Perona,Max Welling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A score-based generative model on periodic domains using Kuramoto dynamics to model orientation-rich patterns, achieving improved generation on fingerprints/textures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard isotropic diffusion struggles with coherent angular patterns; phase synchronization inspired by biology offers a structured prior to capture circular geometry and orientation.

Method: Forward diffusion performs synchronization among phase variables via globally or locally coupled oscillators and attraction to a global reference phase, collapsing data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process desynchronizes using a learned score function. Uses wrapped Gaussian transitions and periodicity-aware networks.

Result: Competitive results on general image benchmarks; significant improvements on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired synchronization dynamics can serve as an effective structured prior for generative modeling on periodic domains.

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired
synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

### [182] [Global Pre-fixing, Local Adjusting: A Simple yet Effective Contrastive Strategy for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15347)
*Jia Tang,Xinrui Wang,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPLASC is a simple contrastive strategy for continual learning that enforces both inter-task separation and intra-task structure by globally fixing equiangular ETF centers on partitioned regions of the representation space and locally adjusting ETFs within each region, yielding more discriminative features and easy integration with existing contrastive CL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting and confusion due to both inter-task and intra-task feature confusion. Existing contrastive CL approaches underutilize global–local structure in the representation space, motivating a method that cleanly separates tasks while regulating per-task feature geometry.

Method: Globally fix inter-task centers by partitioning the unit hypersphere into non-overlapping regions whose centers form an inter-task Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). Within each region, regulate the feature structure by forming intra-task adjustable ETFs for each task. The approach is designed to be plug-and-play and compatible with existing contrastive continual learning frameworks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness, showing improved discriminative feature structures across and within tasks and compatibility with existing CL frameworks (i.e., reduced forgetting and better transfer in continual learning benchmarks).

Conclusion: GPLASC provides a simple yet effective mechanism to jointly enforce inter-task and intra-task discriminative structures in contrastive continual learning, and can be easily integrated into existing contrastive CL pipelines.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

### [183] [Probabilistic Conformal Coverage Guarantees in Small-Data Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15349)
*Petrus H. Zwart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSBC offers finite-sample probabilistic coverage guarantees for split conformal predictions by adjusting the significance level via the exact finite-sample distribution of conformal coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability in realized coverage across calibration sets in split conformal prediction, which undermines risk control and guarantees that are only training-conditional in expectation.

Method: Introduce Small Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal significance level. It leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of conformal coverage to compute a calibrated level that provides probabilistic guarantees over calibration randomness.

Result: When applied, the deployed predictor achieves at least the desired coverage with user-specified probability across calibration draws, improving risk control in finite samples.

Conclusion: SSBC provides finite-sample, training-conditional coverage guarantees for split conformal prediction, with minimal overhead and easy adoption in practice.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
guaranteed marginal coverage. However, in split conformal prediction this
guarantee is training-conditional only in expectation: across many calibration
draws, the average coverage equals the nominal level, but the realized coverage
for a single calibration set may vary substantially. This variance undermines
effective risk control in practical applications. Here we introduce the Small
Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal
significance level that leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of
conformal coverage to provide probabilistic guarantees, ensuring that with
user-defined probability over the calibration draw, the deployed predictor
achieves at least the desired coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs show highly variable zero-shot predictive performance on tabular tasks; when base-task performance is good, LLM-provided probabilities better reflect individual-level accuracy; proposes unsupervised task-level metrics to forecast performance on new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To guide practitioners on when to trust LLMs for zero-shot predictions and how to predict their performance on new tasks without labeled data.

Method: Large-scale empirical study across diverse tabular prediction tasks, evaluating zero-shot LLMs, analyzing calibration of probabilities, and constructing task-level metrics that do not require labels.

Result: Performance is highly variable across tasks and datasets; good base-task performance correlates with stronger signal in LLM probabilities for individual-level accuracy; some unsupervised metrics predict cross-task performance well.

Conclusion: Certain unsupervised task-level metrics can signal whether LLMs will perform well on a new task, enabling better decision-making about deploying LLMs for zero-shot predictions.

Abstract: Recent work has investigated the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
as zero-shot models for generating individual-level characteristics (e.g., to
serve as risk models or augment survey datasets). However, when should a user
have confidence that an LLM will provide high-quality predictions for their
particular task? To address this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study of LLMs' zero-shot predictive capabilities across a wide range of tabular
prediction tasks. We find that LLMs' performance is highly variable, both on
tasks within the same dataset and across different datasets. However, when the
LLM performs well on the base prediction task, its predicted probabilities
become a stronger signal for individual-level accuracy. Then, we construct
metrics to predict LLMs' performance at the task level, aiming to distinguish
between tasks where LLMs may perform well and where they are likely unsuitable.
We find that some of these metrics, each of which are assessed without labeled
data, yield strong signals of LLMs' predictive performance on new tasks.

TL;DR: Connects generalized derivatives with moduli of local continuity and introduces a non-uniform stochastic sampling method to estimate these moduli, enabling scalable robustness and fairness analysis in neural networks used in closed-loop settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moduli of local continuity are useful for evaluating robustness and repeated-use fairness of neural networks, but practical estimation is difficult in high dimensions. Establishing a link to generalized derivatives provides theoretical insight and a path to estimators for complex models.

Method: Revisit the theoretical relationship between generalized derivatives and moduli of local continuity and develop a non-uniform stochastic sample approximation algorithm for the modulus of local continuity.

Result: Proposes a scalable estimator for the modulus via non-uniform sampling, grounded in the generalized-derivative connection, with theoretical justification and potential efficacy for robustness and fairness assessment in neural networks.

Conclusion: This work enables practical robustness and fairness analysis through moduli of local continuity and offers a concrete estimation method suitable for high-dimensional, repeated-use neural-network settings.

Abstract: Modulus of local continuity is used to evaluate the robustness of neural
networks and fairness of their repeated uses in closed-loop models. Here, we
revisit a connection between generalized derivatives and moduli of local
continuity, and present a non-uniform stochastic sample approximation for
moduli of local continuity. This is of importance in studying robustness of
neural networks and fairness of their repeated uses.

*Vicky Kouni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes adversarial generalization of unfolding networks under l2 FGSM attacks using adversarial Rademacher complexity, providing tight bounds and empirical validation, and showing overparameterization can enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unfolding networks are interpretable, data-structure-aware models used for inverse problems (e.g., compressed sensing). A solid theoretical understanding of their robustness to adversarial attacks is crucial for high-stakes applications.

Method: They propose a framework to estimate the adversarial Rademacher complexity for a family of overparameterized unfolding networks under l2-norm FGSM attacks, derive generalization bounds that are tight in the attack level, and validate the theory with experiments on real data.

Result: They obtain bounds that are tight with respect to the attack level, and empirical results corroborate the theory across datasets; they also show that overparameterization can be leveraged to improve adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: This work constitutes the first theoretical analysis of adversarial generalization for unfolding networks, and suggests that overparameterization can be exploited to promote robustness, guiding robust design of unfolding models.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

### [187] [Learning in Stackelberg Mean Field Games: A Non-Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15392)
*Sihan Zeng,Benjamin Patrick Evans,Sujay Bhatt,Leo Ardon,Sumitra Ganesh,Alec Koppel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-SMFG is a single-loop actor-critic algorithm for Stackelberg mean-field games that achieves non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under a gradient-alignment condition, by learning the leader, a representative follower, and the mean field from streaming Markovian samples, and outperforms baselines in economics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior Stackelberg MFG methods, which rely on restrictive leader–follower independence assumptions, are sample-inefficient due to nested loops, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.

Method: Introduce AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic approach that updates the leader, a representative follower, and the mean field using (semi-)gradient steps on continuously generated Markovian samples. The method relies on a gradient-alignment condition that allows approximating the full leader gradient with a partial component, relaxing strict independence. The paper provides finite-time and finite-sample convergence guarantees to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective.

Result: The algorithm converges to a stationary point in finite time with finite samples (non-asymptotic guarantees). Simulations across standard economics environments show AC-SMFG achieves better policy quality and faster convergence than existing multi-agent and MFG baselines.

Conclusion: AC-SMFG is the first Stackelberg MFG method with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, made possible by gradient alignment that relaxes prior independence assumptions. This yields a practical, scalable solution for hierarchical mean-field interactions with strong empirical performance in economics settings.

Abstract: We study policy optimization in Stackelberg mean field games (MFGs), a
hierarchical framework for modeling the strategic interaction between a single
leader and an infinitely large population of homogeneous followers. The
objective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in
which the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating
the response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)
problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the
leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to
nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.
To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic
algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The
algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a
representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in
practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the
algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,
this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees. Our key assumption is a "gradient alignment" condition, which
requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a
partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence
assumption. Simulation results in a range of well-established economics
environments demonstrate that AC-SMFG outperforms existing multi-agent and MFG
learning baselines in policy quality and convergence speed.

### [188] [VMDNet: Time Series Forecasting with Leakage-Free Samplewise Variational Mode Decomposition and Multibranch Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15394)
*Weibin Feng,Ran Tao,John Cartlidge,Jin Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VMDNet: a causality-preserving, sample-wise VMD framework for time series forecasting that uses frequency-aware embeddings and parallel TCNs, with bilevel optimization to adaptively set K and alpha; achieves state-of-the-art performance on energy datasets, especially with strong periodicity and robustness to weak periodicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information leakage in VMD-based models and the challenge of inappropriate hyperparameter tuning (K, alpha) while preserving causal structure and efficiently learning periodic patterns.

Method: Apply sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; decompose into modes; represent each mode with frequency-aware embeddings; decode using parallel temporal convolutional networks to ensure mode independence; employ a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimization to adaptively select K and alpha.

Result: On two energy-related datasets, VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is strong, and demonstrates clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

Conclusion: VMDNet provides a causality-preserving, period-aware decomposition framework for time series forecasting with adaptive hyperparameter tuning, achieving strong predictive performance and robustness across varying periodicity levels.

Abstract: In time series forecasting, capturing recurrent temporal patterns is
essential; decomposition techniques make such structure explicit and thereby
improve predictive performance. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a
powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has
seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer
from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To
address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that
(i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed
mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient
learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to
adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and
the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets
demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is
strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns
while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

### [189] [Adaptive Algorithms with Sharp Convergence Rates for Stochastic Hierarchical Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15399)
*Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Hao,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive stochastic hierarchical optimization algorithms that do not assume prior knowledge of gradient noise, achieving sharp convergence rates for minimax and bilevel problems via momentum normalization and adaptive parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical optimization (minimax and bilevel) with interdependent variables is prevalent, but existing stochastic methods lack adaptivity to gradient noise levels, preventing optimal convergence across regimes.

Method: Develop adaptive algorithms for two classes: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax and nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel. The methods combine momentum normalization with novel adaptive parameter choices to achieve rate tilde-O(1/sqrt(T) + sqrt(bar sigma)/T^{1/4}) for gradient norm without requiring knowledge of noise level.

Result: The proposed algorithms give sharp, adaptive convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical optimization and demonstrate effectiveness through experiments on synthetic data and deep learning tasks.

Conclusion: This work delivers the first adaptive and sharp theoretical guarantees for stochastic hierarchical optimization and validates practical performance, enabling automatic adaptivity to varying noise levels.

Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision
variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While
various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack
adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal
convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior
knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive
algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization
problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and
nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp
convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$
in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound
on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without
prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in
both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first
adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical
optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization
technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.

*Eric Aislan Antonelo,Gustavo Claudio Karl Couto,Christian Möller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-Augmented Implicit Behavioral Cloning (DA-IBC) with energy-based models improves multimodal driving decisions by perturbing expert actions to create counterexamples and using better initialization for derivative-free inference, outperforming standard IBC in CARLA's urban tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Behavior Cloning cannot capture multimodal, valid actions for the same scenario in driving; Energy-Based Models can represent multimodal action distributions; perturbation-based data augmentation can improve IBC training.

Method: Combine Implicit Behavioral Cloning with Energy-Based Models; introduce DA-IBC by perturbing expert actions to form counterexamples; use improved initialization for derivative-free inference; evaluate on CARLA with Bird's-Eye View inputs in urban multimodal tasks; compare against standard IBC.

Result: DA-IBC outperforms standard IBC in urban multimodal driving tasks; learned energy landscapes capture multimodal action distributions that BC cannot.

Conclusion: DA-IBC provides an effective framework for multimodal imitation learning in autonomous driving, enabling EBMs to represent multiple valid actions and showing the benefit of data augmentation and initialization strategies for derivative-free inference.

Abstract: Standard Behavior Cloning (BC) fails to learn multimodal driving decisions,
where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario. We explore Implicit
Behavioral Cloning (IBC) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to better capture this
multimodality. We propose Data-Augmented IBC (DA-IBC), which improves learning
by perturbing expert actions to form the counterexamples of IBC training and
using better initialization for derivative-free inference. Experiments in the
CARLA simulator with Bird's-Eye View inputs demonstrate that DA-IBC outperforms
standard IBC in urban driving tasks designed to evaluate multimodal behavior
learning in a test environment. The learned energy landscapes are able to
represent multimodal action distributions, which BC fails to achieve.

### [191] [Top-$k$ Feature Importance Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15420)
*Yuxi Chen,Tiffany Tang,Genevera Allen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAMPART is a principled framework to rank top-k features by leveraging any base feature importance score, using adaptive sequential halving and ensembling to optimize ranking accuracy, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ranking important features (top-k) is crucial but underexplored; standard importance scores are not optimized for ranking; need scalable, provable methods for high-dimensional data (e.g., genomics).

Method: Combines a generic importance measure with adaptive sequential halving, mini-patches, recursive trimming, and observation/feature subsampling in an ensemble to efficiently allocate resources to promising features and optimize top-k ranking rather than post-hoc ranking.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: correct top-k ranking with high probability under mild conditions. Empirical results via simulations show RAMPART consistently outperforms popular feature importance methods. A high-dimensional genomics case study demonstrates practical utility.

Conclusion: RAMPART offers a principled, scalable approach to feature ranking that improves ranking accuracy over existing importance-based methods and is suitable for high-dimensional scientific data.

Abstract: Accurate ranking of important features is a fundamental challenge in
interpretable machine learning with critical applications in scientific
discovery and decision-making. Unlike feature selection and feature importance,
the specific problem of ranking important features has received considerably
less attention. We introduce RAMPART (Ranked Attributions with MiniPatches And
Recursive Trimming), a framework that utilizes any existing feature importance
measure in a novel algorithm specifically tailored for ranking the top-$k$
features. Our approach combines an adaptive sequential halving strategy that
progressively focuses computational resources on promising features with an
efficient ensembling technique using both observation and feature subsampling.
Unlike existing methods that convert importance scores to ranks as
post-processing, our framework explicitly optimizes for ranking accuracy. We
provide theoretical guarantees showing that RAMPART achieves the correct
top-$k$ ranking with high probability under mild conditions, and demonstrate
through extensive simulation studies that RAMPART consistently outperforms
popular feature importance methods, concluding with a high-dimensional genomics
case study.

### [192] [Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15429)
*Victor Chardès*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A nearly parameter-free sparse PCA approach for scRNA-seq using random matrix theory (RMT) guided sparsity and a Sinkhorn-inspired biwhitening to stabilize variance, improving subspace reconstruction and cell-type classification across technologies and sparse PCA algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-cell RNA-seq data are extremely noisy and heterogeneous due to biological variability, amplification bias, sequencing depth, and capture efficiency. PCA is widely used for interpretability and robustness, but existing pipelines struggle with heterogeneity and evolving technologies. A robust, interpretable, and scalable dimensionality reduction method that can automatically infer sparse principal components is highly desirable.

Method: Introduce a biwhitening procedure inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to stabilize variance across genes and cells. Use an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Apply this within existing sparse PCA algorithms to infer sparse PCs while preserving PCA interpretability. Evaluate across seven scRNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms.

Result: Across seven scRNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, the method improves reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Conclusion: The approach preserves PCA interpretability while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components, and is adaptable across heterogeneous datasets and evolving technologies.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells
but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR
amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,
making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous
datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on
principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its
interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix
Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal
components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel
biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that
simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use
of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering
sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains
the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of
sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and
four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves
the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,
autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand neural networks and their training dynamics using tropical geometry; leverage the piecewise linear structure to analyze expressivity and trainability.

Method: Represent activations with tropical arithmetic; develop algorithms to partition input space into regions where the network is a linear map; perform computational experiments to study training behavior.

Result: Algorithms for region identification; empirical findings on training difficulty, overfitting, and the benefits of skip connections.

Conclusion: Tropical geometric representation offers a viable framework to analyze piecewise linear networks, with practical implications such as informing architectural choices like skip connections to mitigate overfitting and improve trainability.

Abstract: Neural networks are important tools in machine learning. Representing
piecewise linear activation functions with tropical arithmetic enables the
application of tropical geometry. Algorithms are presented to compute regions

we provide insights on the difficulty to train neural networks, in particular
on the problems of overfitting and on the benefits of skip connections.

### [194] [Hierarchical Self-Attention: Generalizing Neural Attention Mechanics to Multi-Scale Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15448)
*Saeed Amizadeh,Sara Abdali,Yinheng Li,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled, entropy-based derivation of hierarchical, multi-modal attention for transformers, with a dynamic-programming-based compute-efficient algorithm, enabling from-scratch training and post-training injection into pre-trained models for improved efficiency and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing attention to data that are multi-scale and multi-modal is challenging with ad hoc heuristics. A principled, scalable framework is needed to incorporate hierarchical and geometric biases into attention.

Method: Introduce a mathematical construct for representing multi-modal, multi-scale data. Derive attention mechanics from entropy minimization principles. Prove the derived attention is closest to standard Softmax attention while encoding hierarchical/geometric inductive biases. Develop a dynamic-programming algorithm to compute this attention efficiently.

Result: When embedded in transformers, the hierarchical attention framework can be trained from scratch for hierarchical/multi-modal tasks and can also be injected into pre-trained transformers post-training, yielding more efficient models in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded framework for hierarchical multi-modal attention that aligns with Softmax attention but enhances it with structure-aware biases, offering practical algorithms and demonstrated applicability to both training and post-training model improvement.

Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.

### [195] [IMPQ: Interaction-Aware Layerwise Mixed Precision Quantization for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15455)
*Junchen Zhao,Ali Derakhshan,Dushyant Bharadwaj,Jayden Kana Hyman,Junhao Dong,Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi,Ian Harris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPQE estimates Shapley values for layer sensitivities and interactions in LLMs, then IMPQ uses these to allocate 2/4-bit precision under memory limits via a binary quadratic program. It delivers strong PTQ performance across Llama-3, Gemma-2, Qwen-3 and multiple backends, particularly at 2–4 bits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device/low-resource deployment of multi-billion-parameter LLMs is hampered by high precision requirements. Existing mixed-precision PTQ methods rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics and fail when average precision falls below ~4 bits due to neglecting inter-layer interactions.

Method: Frame mixed-precision quantization as a cooperative game among layers. Introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to efficiently estimate layer sensitivities including inter-layer interactions. Build Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) on SPQE to solve a binary quadratic optimization that assigns 2 or 4 bits per layer under strict memory constraints.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 across three PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) shows IMPQ is scalable and yields consistently superior performance to methods relying only on isolated metrics. Across 4-bit to 2-bit accuracy, IMPQ reduces perplexity by 20–80% relative to the best baseline, with larger gains as bit-width tightens.

Conclusion: Incorporating inter-layer interactions via Shapley-based estimates and solving a joint 2/4-bit allocation under memory constraints yields substantial PTQ gains for large language models, outperforming layer-local metric approaches across multiple models and backends.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise impressive capabilities, yet their
multi-billion-parameter scale makes on-device or low-resource deployment
prohibitive. Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but
existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as
they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical
inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we
propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the
mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and
introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to
efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and
inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose
Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these
Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning
either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models
across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's
scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying
solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2
bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline,
with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.

*Junhong Lin,Song Wang,Xiaojie Guo,Julian Shun,Yada Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EvoReasoner and EvoKG for temporally evolving knowledge graphs to improve dynamic question answering with LLMs; outperforms baselines and enables smaller models to rival larger ones through temporal reasoning and KG evolution; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to reason over knowledge that changes over time; static knowledge graphs fail to capture temporal dynamics and inconsistencies. A temporally aware reasoning framework plus a noise-tolerant KG evolution module is needed to maintain up-to-date factual grounding for robust QA.

Method: EvoReasoner: a temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm with global-local entity grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. EvoKG: a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG from unstructured documents via confidence-based contradiction resolution and temporal trend tracking.

Result: Empirical evaluation on temporal QA benchmarks and a dynamic end-to-end setting shows EvoReasoner+EvoKG outperform prompting-based and KG-enhanced baselines, narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on dynamic QA; an 8B model with this approach matches a 671B model prompted seven months later; code released.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal reasoning with KG evolution yields robust, up-to-date LLM performance on dynamic tasks, underscoring the importance of handling temporal dynamics and data noise in knowledge-grounded AI.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many language understanding tasks but
struggle to reason over knowledge that evolves. To address this, recent work
has explored augmenting LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide structured,
up-to-date information. However, many existing approaches assume a static
snapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual
inconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of
reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a
temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity
grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To
ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce
EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG
from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution
and temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks
and a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw
documents. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced
baselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on
dynamic question answering. Notably, an 8B-parameter model using our approach
matches the performance of a 671B model prompted seven months later. These
results highlight the importance of combining temporal reasoning with KG
evolution for robust and up-to-date LLM performance. Our code is publicly
available at github.com/junhongmit/TREK.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarCAST is a causally informed model that forecasts future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from the site and nearby stations, employing a three-pronged neural approach to handle confounding: (i) observable synchronous factors via embeddings, (ii) latent synchronous factors via a spatio-temporal graph neural network, and (iii) time-lagged influences via a gated transformer; it achieves strong accuracy, outperforming baselines and reducing error by 25.9% relative to the top commercial forecaster Solcast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, accessible solar forecasting is essential for renewable energy management. Prior methods often rely on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and preprocessing. SolarCAST aims to deliver high-accuracy forecasts using public sensor data alone by systematically modeling different confounding factors behind X–S correlations.

Method: 1) Embedding module to encode observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity). 2) Spatio-temporal graph neural network to capture latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns). 3) A gated transformer to model time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations) and learn temporal shifts.

Result: SolarCAST outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions and achieves a 25.9% error reduction compared to the top commercial forecaster, Solcast.

Conclusion: A lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting that leverages public sensor data and causal modeling of multiple confounding factors.

Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management.
We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FRAUDGUESS is a dual-purpose fraud analytics system that discovers unknown fraud types as micro-clusters in a tailored feature space and provides evidence through visualization, heatmaps, and an interactive dashboard; it has real-world deployment potential and has identified three new fraudulent behaviors in a million-scale dataset, with two validated by experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to detect not only known frauds (supervised labels) but also new, unknown fraud patterns (detection) and to justify conclusions to analysts (justification) in large-scale financial transactions.

Method: Design of a specialized feature space to reveal micro-clusters corresponding to new fraud types, plus visualization tools (heatmaps) and an interactive dashboard for experts to inspect evidence and perform deep dives; deployment in an anonymous financial institution context (AFI) is discussed.

Result: Identified three new fraud-related behaviors in a real, million-scale dataset; two of these behaviors were labeled fraudulent or suspicious by domain experts, capturing hundreds of previously undetected fraudulent transactions.

Conclusion: FRAUDGUESS demonstrates practical utility for discovering unknown fraud types and providing interpretable justification, with real-world deployment potential and demonstrated impact on fraud coverage.

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how
much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find
fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known
types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new
types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we
also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion
('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals:
(a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a
carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses
visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard
for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for
deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present
the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale
financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious
by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would
otherwise go un-noticed.

TL;DR: WIEN-INR is a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation for scientific data that distributes modeling across resolution scales, with a specialized kernel at the finest scale to capture subtle details, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction with compact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INRs struggle to faithfully represent multi-scale, high-frequency, and fine-texture content when constrained to small networks, limiting their use for scientific data encoding.

Method: A multi-scale wavelet-based INR architecture that allocates modeling across scales and uses a specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details, enabling smaller networks and efficient training while preserving full detail.

Result: WIEN-INR achieves superior reconstruction fidelity on diverse scientific datasets across scales, while maintaining compact model size and training efficiency, demonstrating effective high-frequency detail preservation with INRs.

Conclusion: WIEN-INR extends the applicability of implicit neural representations to high-fidelity scientific data by leveraging wavelet-informed multi-scale modeling and a finest-scale kernel, offering a practical, efficient framework for accurate data encoding.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and
parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding
information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent
representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when
constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the
multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that
characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that
distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a
specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This
multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the
full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and
reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific
datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR
achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model
size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation
framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the
applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is
essential.

*Zahra Aref,Narayan B. Mandayam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EWA-VQ-ODT enhances Online Decision Transformers with an action-specific memory via a vector-quantized codebook that modulates attention, improving sample efficiency and early performance without altering the backbone or training objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of explicit action-specific memory in standard attention-based DTs and improve long-horizon action effectiveness and exploration in online RL.

Method: Introduce Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization (EWA-VQ) to ODT. Maintain per-action attractions updated online through decay and reward-based reinforcement, stored in a compact VQ codebook. Continuous actions are routed to the closest code, which stores a scalar attraction that biases attention columns of corresponding action tokens. No changes to backbone or objective; provide theoretical bounds on attraction dynamics and attention drift.

Result: On standard continuous-control benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT yields improved sample efficiency and higher average return compared with ODT, especially in early training. The method is computationally light, interpretable via per-code traces, and accompanied by theoretical guarantees on attraction dynamics.

Conclusion: EWA-VQ-ODT offers a lightweight, interpretable augmentation to online decision transformers that enhances performance by incorporating action-specific experiences into attention, with bounded dynamics and no modification to core training.


Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential
decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement
learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value
function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL
as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and
lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation
through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable
alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on
bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use
standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.
This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.
Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we
propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online
Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains
per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.
Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact
vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated
online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate
attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no
change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control
benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,
particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,
interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that
bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.

TL;DR: Introduces a Bayesian, risk-aware policy gradient method for MDPs with a general loss and unknown parameters, using coherent risk measures; provides convergence guarantees and extends to episodic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address epistemic uncertainty in unknown MDP parameters by Bayesian estimation and a coherent risk functional on the loss, enabling risk-aware optimization beyond standard expected loss.

Method: Propose a policy gradient optimization leveraging the dual representation of coherent risk measures and an extended envelope theorem for continuous cases; analyze stationary points; extend to an episodic setting.

Result: Establishes a convergence rate of O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2}) for online policy gradient (T gradient iterations, r gradient estimator samples); proves global convergence in the episodic extension and provides iteration bounds to achieve O(ε) error per episode.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of risk-sensitive Bayesian MDP optimization beyond dynamic programming, with provable convergence guarantees and applicability to episodic settings.

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the
epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian
approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk
functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.
Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability
principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by
approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy
gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent
risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then
show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of
$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations
and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our
algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the
extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to
achieve an error bound $O(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

### [202] [KoopCast: Trajectory Forecasting via Koopman Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15513)
*Jungjin Lee,Jaeuk Shin,Gihwan Kim,Joonho Han,Insoon Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage trajectory forecasting model (KoopCast) combining probabilistic goal estimation with a Koopman-operator refinement to achieve accurate, interpretable, and low-latency predictions in dynamic, map-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for trajectory forecasting methods that are simultaneously accurate, interpretable, and fast in complex, nonlinear, multi-agent environments with map constraints.

Method: Stage 1: probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts plausible long-horizon targets. Stage 2: a Koopman operator-based refinement module lifts history and intention into a higher-dimensional nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction in that space to determine how to move.

Result: Competitive predictive accuracy across ETH/UCY, Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes; demonstrates mode-level interpretability and low-latency deployment, effective in multi-agent and map-constrained settings.

Conclusion: KoopCast delivers a strong balance of accuracy, interpretability via Koopman spectral theory, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time trajectory forecasting in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory
forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman
operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by
lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a
two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts
plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman
operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a
nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.
This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also
inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully
capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key
advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman
spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits
on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich
multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across
benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together
with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.

*Zelong Bi,Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of manifold-based intrinsic dimension estimation, reviewing foundations, eight estimators, and empirical evaluation; finds that simpler methods often outperform complex ones and provides practical, dataset-aware tuning guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating intrinsic dimension is crucial to exploit low-dimensional manifold structure, but existing theory and evaluations are fragmented. This work aims to synthesize theoretical foundations, compare representative estimators, and provide practical guidance for researchers and practitioners.

Method: Survey of theoretical underpinnings; presentation of eight representative estimators; controlled experiments varying noise, curvature, and sample size; cross-dataset comparison on synthetic and real-world data; introduces principled, dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Systematic analysis of estimator performance under varying conditions; actionable recommendations for estimator choice and hyperparameter tuning; evidence that simpler methods can outperform more complex approaches in general settings.

Conclusion: Provides a practical roadmap for intrinsic dimension estimation, emphasizes dataset-aware tuning and simplicity, and highlights gaps for future benchmarks and research.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or
near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is
essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension
estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides
a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review
often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative
estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors
such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare
the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a
principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results
offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality,
simpler methods often perform better.

### [204] [Fully Decentralized Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is A Context Modeling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15519)
*Chao Li,Bingkun Bao,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAC is a decentralized MARL method that uses latent contexts to model non-stationary dynamics and a context-based value function with optimistic marginal value to mitigate relative overgeneralization; shows strong performance on matrix games, Predator-Prey, and SMAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully decentralized MARL suffers from non-stationarity due to unobserved joint policies and relative overgeneralization; existing methods fail to address both simultaneously.

Method: Represents each agent's local task as a Contextual MDP; identifies unobserved contexts as switches in joint policy; learns latent context dynamics; introduces context-based value function; derives optimistic marginal value for estimation.

Result: Empirically outperforms baselines on cooperative tasks (matrix game, Predator-Prey, SMAC).

Conclusion: DAC effectively addresses non-stationarity and relative overgeneralization via dynamics-aware context modeling; demonstrates effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper studies fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where each agent solely observes the states, its local actions, and
the shared rewards. The inability to access other agents' actions often leads
to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative
overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective
cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both
issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of
other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the
task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision
Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative
overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC
attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches
between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.
Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and
refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based
value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function
update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived
to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the
relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various
cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its
superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.

### [205] [Universal Learning of Stochastic Dynamics for Exact Belief Propagation using Bernstein Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15533)
*Peter Amorese,Morteza Lahijanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning framework that combines normalizing flows and Bernstein polynomials to universally approximate nonlinear stochastic dynamics while preserving analytical belief propagation; empirically superior in challenging non-Gaussian/non-additive noise scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Belief propagation under uncertainty requires accurately modeling nonlinear stochastic dynamics. When the system is unknown and learned from data, it is crucial to have a model that (i) universally approximates general nonlinear dynamics and (ii) supports tractable, analytical belief propagation.

Method: Introduce a model class that merges the density-estimation power of normalizing flows with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials to enable universal approximation with closed-form belief propagation updates.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the learned model outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven methods for belief propagation, particularly for highly nonlinear systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical foundations for a class of models that achieve both universal nonlinear dynamics approximation and analytical belief propagation, and demonstrates practical benefits on challenging stochastic systems.

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as
belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However,
nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable,
requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be
learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i)
universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii)
supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical
foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed
approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density
estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical
results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art
data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear
systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

### [206] [Nonconvex Decentralized Stochastic Bilevel Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15543)
*Xinwen Zhang,Yihan Zhang,Hongchang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm is proposed for nonconvex bilevel problems with heavy-tailed noise. It uses a normalized stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent method that avoids clipping, provides convergence guarantees, and is empirically effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world machine learning often exhibits heavy-tailed gradient noise and non-strongly convex lower-level objectives. Traditional decentralized bilevel methods rely on finite-variance gradients and strong convexity, which are not always satisfied. This work aims to provide a theoretically sound algorithm with guarantees under heavy-tailed noise in a decentralized setting.

Method: A normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent algorithm designed for decentralized nonconvex bilevel optimization under heavy-tailed noise. The approach avoids gradient clipping, and the analysis bounds interdependent gradient sequences to establish convergence.

Result: The authors establish convergence rates for the proposed algorithm under heavy-tailed noises in the decentralized bilevel setting. They claim this is the first method with such guarantees, and they corroborate the theory with extensive experiments showing effectiveness under heavy-tailed noise.

Conclusion: This work fills a gap by relaxing common assumptions (finite variance and strong convexity) and providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation for decentralized nonconvex bilevel optimization in the presence of heavy-tailed noise.

Abstract: Existing decentralized stochastic optimization methods assume the lower-level
loss function is strongly convex and the stochastic gradient noise has finite
variance. These strong assumptions typically are not satisfied in real-world
machine learning models. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm for the nonconvex
bilevel optimization problem under heavy-tailed noises. Specifically, we
develop a normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent
algorithm, which does not rely on any clipping operation. Moreover, we
establish its convergence rate by innovatively bounding interdependent gradient
sequences under heavy-tailed noises for nonconvex decentralized bilevel
optimization problems. As far as we know, this is the first decentralized
bilevel optimization algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees under
heavy-tailed noises. The extensive experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm in handling heavy-tailed noises.

### [207] [PolyJuice Makes It Real: Black-Box, Universal Red Teaming for Synthetic Image Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15551)
*Sepehr Dehdashtian,Mashrur M. Morshed,Jacob H. Seidman,Gaurav Bharaj,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolyJuice is a black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for synthetic image detectors (SIDs) that exploits distribution shifts in the T2I latent space to universally steer images toward detector failures, improving attack effectiveness and enabling efficient cross-resolution transfer; augmentation with PolyJuice data also boosts detector robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Red-teaming SIDs typically requires white-box access or per-image optimization, which is impractical for proprietary detectors. A scalable black-box, universal attacker is needed to reveal vulnerabilities and guide defenses.

Method: Offline, black-box analysis identifies a latent-space shift direction between samples correctly vs incorrectly classified by the SID. It then uses a universal steering vector to push generated images toward the SID’s failure modes. The approach supports low-resolution estimation and simple interpolation to transfer directions across resolutions, and uses PolyJuice-augmented data to train more robust detectors.

Result: Steered images substantially outperform baseline (up to ~84% stronger deception). Steering directions can be estimated at low resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions via interpolation, reducing cost. Retraining detectors on PolyJuice-augmented data yields robustness gains up to ~30%.

Conclusion: A scalable, black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming framework can reveal and exploit SID weaknesses without white-box access, with efficient cross-resolution transfer and tangible improvements in detector robustness through data augmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by
the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming
improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes
via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)
require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary
state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through
expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,
based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples
correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by
(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline
process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting
this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's
failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at
deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also
show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower
resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation,
reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on
PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors
(up to 30%).

### [208] [The Multi-Query Paradox in Zeroth-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15552)
*Wei Lin,Qingyu Song,Hong Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study of query-budget allocation in zeroth-order optimization, comparing ZO-Avg and ZO-Align. Finds a dichotomy: single-query is optimal for ZO-Avg, while multi-query is advantageous for ZO-Align, effectively reducing the problem to choosing between two aggregation schemes rather than an intermediate query count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ZO optimization is useful when gradients are unavailable. Multi-query estimation can reduce variance but consumes budget; with a fixed query budget, the distribution of queries across iterations is ambiguous. The paper aims to resolve how to allocate queries by analyzing aggregation methods.

Method: The authors analyze two aggregation strategies: ZO-Avg (simple averaging of multi-query estimates) and ZO-Align (Projection Alignment derived from local surrogate minimization). They derive convergence rates that explicitly show dependence on the number of queries across strongly convex, convex, non-convex, and stochastic settings, and provide theoretical results plus experiments to validate them.

Result: A clear dichotomy emerges: for ZO-Avg, more than one query per iteration is query-inefficient; the single-query approach is optimal. For ZO-Align, more queries generally improve performance, with full-subspace estimation being optimal. Budget allocation becomes a choice between two canonical algorithms based on aggregation method, not a continuum of query counts.

Conclusion: The work clarifies multi-query trade-offs in zeroth-order optimization by tying the optimal query strategy to the chosen aggregation method. Practitioners should select between ZO-Avg and ZO-Align depending on budget and desired estimation strategy, with experimental results supporting the theory.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems
where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only
queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but
suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to
improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:
under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the
total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one
another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored
question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze
two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new
Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate
minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the
dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,
non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,
we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always
query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the
contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,
resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work
clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an
intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated
entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also
consistently validated by extensive experiments.

### [209] [Reward Hacking Mitigation using Verifiable Composite Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15557)
*Mirza Farhan Bin Tarek,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a composite reward function to curb reward hacking in RLVR for medical QA; yields better-formatted reasoning, less hacking, and competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR enables LLMs to learn reasoning without supervision but is vulnerable to reward hacking in medical QA, notably by skipping reasoning or using manipulative reasoning formats. This undermines reliability and safety.

Method: Augment the RLVR reward model with penalties targeting two hacking behaviors: (i) providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and (ii) using non-standard or exploitative reasoning formats. Train and evaluate the extended reward model against baselines on medical QA tasks.

Result: Experiments show the approach produces better-formatted, more verifiable reasoning, reduces reward hacking, and maintains good accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A step toward reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of RLVR-based medical QA systems; future work could generalize penalties and assess broader domains and long-term impacts.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that
large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct
supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for
question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the
reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i)
providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing
non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate
these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for
these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed
reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and
good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward
reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR.

### [210] [Small LLMs with Expert Blocks Are Good Enough for Hyperparamter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15561)
*Om Naphade,Saksham Bansal,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for hyper-parameter tuning (HPT) that uses small LLMs via a Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS) to analyze training progress, yielding near-GPT-4 performance with a small budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPT with large models is costly and opaque; there is a need for reliable, cost-efficient methods that leverage smaller LLMs to understand optimization dynamics.

Method: Proposes an Expert Block Framework for HPT with Small LLMs. Introduces Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that converts raw training trajectories into structured context. Uses two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget in the HPT pipeline.

Result: The TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six tasks using only a 10-trial budget and small LLMs.

Conclusion: Trajectory-context summarization enables small LLMs to perform HPT with reliability approaching that of GPT-4, suggesting a cost-effective, scalable alternative for hyper-parameter tuning in ML pipelines.

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML)
pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

### [211] [How many classes do we need to see for novel class discovery?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15585)
*Akanksha Sarkar,Been Kim,Jennifer J. Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, controllable dSprites-based framework to study factors influencing novel class discovery; finds that adding known classes yields performance gains up to a saturation point with diminishing returns, informing cost-benefit analyses and future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why new class discovery succeeds under entangled real-world data, and to identify key levers (numbers of known/unknown classes and coverage) that influence discovery.

Method: Procedurally modify dSprites factors to create controlled experimental settings; systematically vary the number of known and unknown classes and coverage; measure discovery performance.

Result: Discovery performance saturates as the number of known classes increases, with diminishing returns across settings; provides practical guidance for practitioners and a baseline for future rigorous research.

Conclusion: The benefit of increasing known classes plateaus; coverage and cost-benefit considerations become important; this framework offers a starting point for more rigorous future studies on class discovery in complex real-world datasets.

Abstract: Novel class discovery is essential for ML models to adapt to evolving
real-world data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to
robotics. However, these datasets contain complex and entangled factors of
variation, making a systematic study of class discovery difficult. As a result,
many fundamental questions are yet to be answered on why and when new class
discoveries are more likely to be successful. To address this, we propose a
simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with
procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what
influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship
between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well
as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our
empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes
reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The
pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for
cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous
future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets.

### [212] [Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15591)
*Zinan Lin,Enshu Liu,Xuefei Ning,Junyi Zhu,Wenyu Wang,Sergey Yekhanin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Zoning Network (LZN) unifies generative modeling, representation learning, and classification by learning a shared Gaussian latent space partitioned into disjoint zones per data type, with encoders/decoders forming task-specific pipelines. It achieves improvements in generation, unsupervised representation learning, and joint tasks, without changing training objectives; code and website provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge three core ML tasks that are typically tackled with separate, loosely related methods, reducing pipeline complexity and enabling cross-task synergy.

Method: LZN imposes a shared Gaussian latent space. Each data type (image, text, labels, etc.) has its own encoder that maps samples to a disjoint latent zone, and a decoder that reconstructs data from latents. Tasks are composed as sequences of encoders/decoders, e.g., label-conditioned image generation uses label encoder + image decoder; image embedding uses image encoder; classification uses image encoder + label decoder. Experiments include augmenting existing generation models (Rectified Flow) to improve FID on CIFAR10, unsupervised representation learning outperforming MoCo/SimCLR on ImageNet linear evaluation, and joint generation/classification on CIFAR10.

Result: Three demonstrations: (1) improved CIFAR10 FID from 2.76 to 2.59 when combined with Rectified Flow, without altering the objective; (2) unsupervised representation learning surpassing MoCo and SimCLR by 9.3% and 0.2% on downstream ImageNet linear accuracy; (3) joint image+label encoding/decoding enabling simultaneous generation and classification, achieving better FID and SoTA CIFAR10 accuracy; publicly available code and project site.

Conclusion: LZN offers a feasible path toward a unified latent-prior framework that can support multiple ML tasks within a single model family, with demonstrated gains in generation quality, representation learning, and joint task performance. Further work could explore more modalities, ablations of zone design, training stability, and scaling to larger datasets.

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

### [213] [Personalized Prediction By Learning Halfspace Reference Classes Under Well-Behaved Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15592)
*Jizhou Huang,Brendan Juba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies PAC-learnability of personalized, sparse linear predictors for sub-populations (halfspaces), providing an O(opt^{1/4}) upper bound and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes domains, there is a need for models that are both accurate and interpretable. The work aims to enable per-query, easy-to-interpret predictions that are competitive on the relevant sub-population, modeled as halfspaces.

Method: Develop a distribution-specific PAC-learning algorithm for learning reference classes that support personalized prediction. Combine this with a list learner of sparse linear representations to obtain a predictor that is a sparse linear classifier, supported on homogeneous halfspace subsets.

Result: Derives the first upper bound of O(opt^{1/4}) for personalized prediction with sparse linear classifiers under homogeneous halfspace subsets. Empirically evaluated on standard benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of interpretable, personalized predictions with PAC guarantees and suggests avenues for extending to broader subpopulation structures and more complex models.

Abstract: In machine learning applications, predictive models are trained to serve
future queries across the entire data distribution. Real-world data often
demands excessively complex models to achieve competitive performance, however,
sacrificing interpretability. Hence, the growing deployment of machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, motivates the search
for methods for accurate and explainable predictions. This work proposes a
Personalized Prediction scheme, where an easy-to-interpret predictor is learned
per query. In particular, we wish to produce a "sparse linear" classifier with
competitive performance specifically on some sub-population that includes the
query point. The goal of this work is to study the PAC-learnability of this
prediction model for sub-populations represented by "halfspaces" in a
label-agnostic setting. We first give a distribution-specific PAC-learning
algorithm for learning reference classes for personalized prediction. By
leveraging both the reference-class learning algorithm and a list learner of
sparse linear representations, we prove the first upper bound,
$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4} )$, for personalized prediction with sparse linear
classifiers and homogeneous halfspace subsets. We also evaluate our algorithms
on a variety of standard benchmark data sets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information overload in online news by improving extractive summarization, enabling more accessible and engaging content through automated summaries.

Method: Transform text with BERT embeddings and frame extractive summarization as a binary classification problem. Compare logistic regression, feed-forward neural networks, and LSTM networks on the Cornell Newsroom dataset (1.3 million article-summary pairs).

Result: LSTM networks outperform baselines and simpler models in F1 and ROUGE-1, highlighting their ability to capture sequential dependencies in sentence selection for summaries.

Conclusion: Automated extractive summarization shows promise for content management systems in online news, enhancing organization and user experience; further work could expand evaluation and generalizability.

Abstract: In the age of information overload, content management for online news
articles relies on efficient summarization to enhance accessibility and user
engagement. This article addresses the challenge of extractive text
summarization by employing advanced machine learning techniques to generate

Cornell Newsroom dataset, comprising 1.3 million article-summary pairs, we

findings demonstrate that LSTM networks, with their ability to capture
sequential dependencies, outperform baseline methods like Lede-3 and simpler

### [215] [Information Geometry of Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15641)
*Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract links information geometry with variational Bayes, showing that natural gradients underpin VB solutions and using the Bayesian Learning Rule to derive consequences: Bayes’ rule simplification, generalized surrogates, and scalable VB for large models, while stressing shared origins and cross-field potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the deep connection between information geometry and variational Bayes and to explore practical implications for machine learning, especially via natural-gradient methods.

Method: The authors use the Bayesian Learning Rule (BLR), a natural-gradient descent algorithm, to derive consequences for VB and discuss implications, including simplifications of Bayes’ rule and scalable VB.

Result: Three consequences are highlighted: (i) Bayes’ rule can be viewed as the addition of natural gradients, (ii) gradient-based methods are generalized via augmented quadratic surrogates, (iii) VB can be scaled to large language models.

Conclusion: Although the connection is known, the paper emphasizes a common origin for information geometry and Bayesian methods and calls for more cross-disciplinary work at their intersection.

Abstract: We highlight a fundamental connection between information geometry and
variational Bayes (VB) and discuss its consequences for machine learning. Under
certain conditions, a VB solution always requires estimation or computation of
natural gradients. We show several consequences of this fact by using the
natural-gradient descent algorithm of Khan and Rue (2023) called the Bayesian
Learning Rule (BLR). These include (i) a simplification of Bayes' rule as
addition of natural gradients, (ii) a generalization of quadratic surrogates
used in gradient-based methods, and (iii) a large-scale implementation of VB
algorithms for large language models. Neither the connection nor its
consequences are new but we further emphasize the common origins of the two
fields of information geometry and Bayes with a hope to facilitate more work at
the intersection of the two fields.

### [216] [Toward Efficient Influence Function: Dropout as a Compression Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15651)
*Yuchen Zhang,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes dropout-based gradient compression to accelerate influence functions for training-data impact analysis on large models, reducing compute and memory needs while preserving key influence information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence functions quantify how individual training points affect model performance, but they are computationally and memory-intensive for modern large-scale models, hindering transparency and data selection.

Method: Introduce dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to approximate the influence function, lowering gradient size and computation with theoretical analysis and empirical validation.

Result: Significant reductions in computational and memory overhead while preserving critical components of data influence, enabling application to large-scale models.

Conclusion: Enables practical use of influence-function-based data valuation in large ML systems, supporting transparency and data-centric model development.

Abstract: Assessing the impact the training data on machine learning models is crucial
for understanding the behavior of the model, enhancing the transparency, and
selecting training data. Influence function provides a theoretical framework
for quantifying the effect of training data points on model's performance given
a specific test data. However, the computational and memory costs of influence
function presents significant challenges, especially for large-scale models,
even when using approximation methods, since the gradients involved in
computation are as large as the model itself. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that leverages dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to
compute the influence function more efficiently. Our method significantly
reduces computational and memory overhead, not only during the influence
function computation but also in gradient compression process. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that our method
could preserves critical components of the data influence and enables its
application to modern large-scale models.

### [217] [Nonconvex Regularization for Feature Selection in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15652)
*Kyohei Suzuki,Konstantinos Slavakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a batch feature-selection method for RL with convergence guarantees by regularizing the Bellman-residual objective using a nonconvex PMC penalty, framed as a nonmonotone-inclusion problem, with FRBS-based convergence analysis and strong empirical performance on noisy features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection in reinforcement learning is hindered by estimation bias and high-dimensional, noisy feature spaces. A theoretically sound, sparsity-promoting approach can improve sample efficiency, interpretability, and performance.

Method: Extend the LSTD-based policy evaluation by optimizing a Bellman-residual objective regularized with the projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty (nonconvex, sparsity-inducing). Because of the PMC penalty’s weak convexity, the problem is cast as a nonmonotone-inclusion problem. Derive convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS) algorithm to solve this problem, enabling an efficient batch feature-selection procedure for RL.

Result: Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, especially when there are many noisy features, indicating strong empirical gains and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretically grounded, efficient feature-selection framework for RL with convergence guarantees, demonstrating notable empirical advantages in noisy, high-dimensional settings and suggesting PMC-based regularization as a viable tool for sparse RL.

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient batch algorithm for feature selection in
reinforcement learning (RL) with theoretical convergence guarantees. To
mitigate the estimation bias inherent in conventional regularization schemes,
the first contribution extends policy evaluation within the classical
least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) framework by formulating a
Bellman-residual objective regularized with the sparsity-inducing, nonconvex
projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty. Owing to the weak convexity of the PMC
penalty, this formulation can be interpreted as a special instance of a general
nonmonotone-inclusion problem. The second contribution establishes novel
convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS)
algorithm to solve this class of problems. Numerical experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, particularly in scenarios with many
noisy features.

### [218] [Inference Offloading for Cost-Sensitive Binary Classification at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15674)
*Vishnu Narayanan Moothedath,Umang Agarwal,Umeshraja N,James Richard Gross,Jaya Prakash Champati,Sharayu Moharir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy for edge-to-cloud classification, to balance local accuracy and remote offloading cost. It is model-agnostic, requires no training, and learns during inference; achieves sublinear regret and robust performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In edge intelligence, false negatives are costly and a compact local model must decide when to offload to a remote model, incurring communication/compute costs. The goal is to understand and optimize the accuracy-versus-offloading-cost trade-off in a hierarchical inference system.

Method: Introduce an online learning framework with two decision thresholds on the local model's confidence. If the local prediction is confident enough, classify locally; otherwise, offload to the remote model. Provide a closed-form solution when the local model is calibrated. For uncalibrated models, present H2T2, prove sublinear regret, and show the approach is model-agnostic and training-free, learning from limited feedback during inference.

Result: Empirical simulations on real-world datasets show H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold hierarchical policies, sometimes beating offline optima. It also demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and mismatched classifiers.

Conclusion: H2T2 offers a practical, model-agnostic, training-free strategy for hierarchical inference with offloading, delivering near-optimal trade-offs and resilient performance in evolving conditions.

Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system
where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a
compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote
model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For
each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.
Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the
remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between
classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical
inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning
framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's
confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model
and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We
present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is
calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce
H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it
achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and
learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world
datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI
policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also
demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to
mismatched classifiers.

### [219] [KITE: Kernelized and Information Theoretic Exemplars for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15676)
*Vaibhav Singh,Soumya Suvra Ghosal,Kapu Nirmal Joshua,Soumyabrata Pal,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a principled, information-theoretic framework for selecting in-context exemplars for LLMs, treating the LLM as a linear predictor over embeddings, and optimizing query-specific exemplar subsets with a surrogate objective that is approximately submodular; enhances with kernel tricks and a design-based diversity regularizer; shows empirical gains over standard retrieval on classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited context budgets in large language models and drawbacks of nearest-neighbor exemplar retrieval in high-dimensional spaces motivate a query-specific, diverse, structure-aware exemplar selection approach to maximize prediction accuracy for a given user query.

Method: Model the LLM as a linear function over input embeddings; formulate subset selection from a larger exemplar bank that minimizes prediction error on a specific query; derive a surrogate objective that is approximately submodular to enable greedy optimization with approximation guarantees; extend with the kernel trick to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces; introduce an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity among selected exemplars.

Result: Empirically demonstrates significant improvements over standard retrieval methods across classification tasks, especially in label-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: A principled, efficient framework for diverse, structure-aware exemplar selection for in-context learning that improves query-specific accuracy and scales to high-dimensional embedding spaces.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL
in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.

### [220] [Uncertainty-Based Smooth Policy Regularisation for Reinforcement Learning with Few Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15981)
*Yujie Zhu,Charles A. Hepburn,Matthew Thorpe,Giovanni Montana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPReD is a continuous, uncertainty-aware imitation framework for reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, using ensemble-based Q-value uncertainty to adaptively weight demonstrations rather than applying binary imitation, yielding substantial data-efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In sparse-reward RL, it is unclear when to imitate demonstrations. Binary imitation signals (e.g., Q-filter) can be brittle and sensitive to demonstration quality/quantity. A principled method to quantify uncertainty and adapt imitation is needed.

Method: SPReD uses ensembles to model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy actions. It introduces two uncertainty-aware methods: (1) a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood that a demonstration is superior, and (2) an advantage-based approach scaling imitation by statistical significance. The imitation signal is a continuous, uncertainty-proportional regularisation weight rather than a binary switch, reducing gradient variance.

Result: Empirical evaluation across eight robotics tasks showed SPReD outperforms existing methods by up to 14x in complex tasks, with robustness to varying demonstration quality and quantity.

Conclusion: SPReD provides a simple yet effective framework for adaptive imitation in sparse-reward RL, improving data efficiency and robustness. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate
learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose
Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that
addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a
demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to
explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy
actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary
uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood
of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation
by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that
make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,
uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance
during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves
remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming
existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining
robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at

*Davide Ettori,Nastaran Darabi,Sureshkumar Senthilkumar,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RMT-KD is a knowledge-distillation method using Random Matrix Theory to identify informative spectral directions in hidden representations, enabling iterative, layer-wise compression with self-distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art models (e.g., BERT, ResNet) are large and compute-intensive, hindering edge deployment; a principled, mathematically grounded compression method is needed.

Method: Spectral analysis of hidden representations via Random Matrix Theory to select informative directions; layer-by-layer causal reduction with self-distillation, avoiding pruning or heuristic rank selection.

Result: On GLUE, AG News, and CIFAR-10, achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with about 2% accuracy loss; 2.8x faster inference and nearly 50% reduction in power consumption.

Conclusion: RMT-KD provides a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation capable of substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art
performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute
demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size.
Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only
informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden
representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with
self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and
CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy
loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.
These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network
distillation.

### [222] [EigenTrack: Spectral Activation Feature Tracking for Hallucination and Out-of-Distribution Detection in LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15735)
*Davide Ettori,Nastaran Darabi,Sina Tayebati,Ranganath Krishnan,Mahesh Subedar,Omesh Tickoo,Amit Ranjan Trivedi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EigenTrack is an interpretable real-time detector for LLM hallucination and OOD drift that uses streaming spectral statistics of hidden activations and a lightweight recurrent classifier to detect shifts with a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination and OOD failures in LLMs undermine reliability; there is a need for real-time, low-latency detection that preserves temporal context and is interpretable.

Method: Compute streaming covariance-spectrum statistics (entropy, eigenvalue gaps, KL divergence from random baselines) from hidden activations; feed these global spectral features into a lightweight recurrent classifier; no resampling; single forward pass; preserves temporal context and allows interpretable accuracy–latency trade-offs.

Result: The approach is claimed to detect hallucination and OOD drift in real time with low latency without resampling, while preserving temporal context and enabling interpretable accuracy–latency trade-offs, potentially outperforming black-/grey-box detectors in key aspects.

Conclusion: EigenTrack offers a practical, scalable, interpretable real-time detector for LLM failures, capable of signaling potential errors before surface manifestations and bridging the gap between white-box interpretability and low-latency detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to
hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an
interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden
activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming
covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL
divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier,
EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal
hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and
grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling.
Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates
global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

### [223] [Aircraft Fuel Flow Modelling with Ageing Effects: From Parametric Corrections to Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15736)
*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Junzi Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Age-aware modelling improvesjet-fuel flow predictions; physics/empirical/ML approaches with age as input or bias reduce bias but data limitations hinder generalisability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fuel-flow models miss engine ageing effects, leading to biased predictions that affect operational planning and environmental assessments; understanding and correcting for ageing improves reliability of forecasts across the fleet.

Method: Compare classical physics-based fuel-flow models, empirical age-correction factors, and data-driven neural networks that either take age as a feature or apply an explicit multiplicative bias; dataset comprises ~19k Quick Access Recorder flights from nine Airbus A320-214 airframes with varying years in service.

Result: Baseline models systematically underestimate fuel consumption for older aircraft; incorporating age via correction factors or neural networks reduces bias and improves predictive accuracy. However, limited airframe count and lack of detailed maintenance data constrain representativeness and generalisation of age-based corrections.

Conclusion: Ageing effects are important for accurate fuel-flow modelling; both parametric and ML frameworks benefit from age information. More diverse datasets including maintenance records are needed to capture real-world engine deterioration and improve generalization.

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

### [224] [GUI-ReWalk: Massive Data Generation for GUI Agent via Stochastic Exploration and Intent-Aware Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15738)
*Musen Lin,Minghao Liu,Taoran Lu,Lichen Yuan,Yiwei Liu,Haonan Xu,Yu Miao,Yuhao Chao,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUI-ReWalk is a two-stage data-synthesis framework that blends stochastic exploration with reasoning-driven goals to produce diverse, realistic GUI trajectories for training GUI agents, enabling long-horizon multi-application workflows and improved benchmark coverage when trained on a large VL model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical shortage of scalable, high-quality GUI trajectory data. Manual annotations are costly and inconsistent, while synthetic methods often sacrifice diversity or task coverage. A scalable dataset that captures intent-aware, adaptive human–computer interaction is needed to train robust GUI agents.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline: (1) stochastic exploration simulating human trial-and-error; (2) reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals steer coherent interactions; support for multi-stride tasks to construct long-horizon workflows across apps; creation of the GUI-ReWalk dataset; training Qwen2.5-VL-7B on this data.

Result: GUI-ReWalk yields higher trajectory entropy, broader coverage of diverse interaction flows, and more realistic user intent across benchmarks Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey, demonstrating improved data efficiency and scalability for GUI agent research.

Conclusion: GUI-ReWalk is a scalable, data-efficient framework that advances GUI agent research and enables robust real-world automation by producing realistic, diverse, intent-aware GUI trajectories for training large multimodal agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and
vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in
digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by
the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data
collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations
or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and
meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a
reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and
diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase
that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions
into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and
purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,
enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple
applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning
for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,
adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B
on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including
Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results
demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction
flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These
findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for
advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

### [225] [Incremental Multistep Forecasting of Battery Degradation Using Pseudo Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15740)
*Jonathan Adam Rico,Nagarajan Raghavan,Senthilnath Jayavelu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iFSNet offers an online, single-pass, multistep forecasting approach for online battery prognosis using pseudo targets, adapting to distribution shifts with FSNet-inspired associative memory; shows strong RMSE/MAE on smooth and irregular degradation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for online adaptive ML in streaming data scenarios where offline retraining is impractical, and current online methods struggle to correct forecasts and require long data collection times.

Method: Proposes iFSNet, a modified FSNet with a single-pass, sample-by-sample update. It uses a simple linear regressor to generate pseudo future targets and computes the loss on the rest of the forecast, updating the model incrementally. It leverages associative memory and adaptive structure from FSNet.

Result: In experiments, iFSNet achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on smooth degradation trajectories, and 0.01588 RMSE and 0.01234 MAE on datasets with irregular degradation and regeneration spikes.

Conclusion: iFSNet enables effective online, single-pass multistep forecasting for battery prognosis, handling varying degradation patterns via pseudo targets and FSNet-inspired memory/adaptive structures.

Abstract: Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent
equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning
(ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining
post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

### [226] [On Optimal Steering to Achieve Exact Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15759)
*Mohit Sharma,Amit Jayant Deshpande,Chiranjib Bhattacharyya,Rajiv Ratn Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL-divergence based steering to an ideal fairness-guaranteed distribution; achieves fairness with no (or reduced) trade-offs and improves utility in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair ML by enforcing fairness guarantees at the distribution level, ensuring that cost-sensitive risks yield exact group-fair outcomes across representations or data.

Method: Define an ideal distribution as the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk that yields exact group fairness. Formulate an optimization to find the nearest ideal distribution in KL-divergence; derive efficient algorithms for parametric families (e.g., normal, log-normal). Apply affine steering to LLM representations to reduce bias in tasks like occupation prediction from bios; steer internal representations toward outputs that perform equally across groups.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world data show improved fairness without sacrificing utility, and sometimes improved utility. Demonstrations include biased reduction in multi-class classification (occupation prediction from bios) and steering LLM internal representations to achieve equal performance across groups.

Conclusion: Proposes a principled, KL-divergence-based framework for steering distributions to ideal fairness, enabling provable fairness guarantees without a utility trade-off and scalable to LLM representations and generative models.

Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is
important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes.
Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could
greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We
define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on
it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We
formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest
ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it
when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families
(e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on
both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing
utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of
LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g.,
occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et
al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired
outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

*Philipp Andelfinger,Jieyi Bi,Qiuyu Zhu,Jianan Zhou,Bo Zhang,Fei Fei Zhang,Chew Wye Chan,Boon Ping Gan,Wentong Cai,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph neural network-based deep reinforcement learning approach for machine-level capacity planning in semiconductor manufacturing. It uses a heterogeneous GNN to model machine/process interactions for proactive decisions and scales to large action spaces, achieving ~1.8% gains in throughput and cycle time in large scenarios from Intel Minifab SMT2020 evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heuristic-based capacity planning is interpretable but struggles to account for complex, cascading interactions along the process flow that lead to bottlenecks; a data-driven, proactive planning method is needed to capture these interactions.

Method: Train a neural network-based model using deep reinforcement learning. Represent the policy with a heterogeneous graph neural network to capture diverse relationships among machines and processing steps. Implement scalability measures to handle the vast action space. Evaluate on Intel's small-scale Minifab model and SMT2020 testbed.

Result: In the largest tested scenario, the trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle time by about 1.8% each.

Conclusion: A GNN-based DRL capacity-planning approach can effectively capture complex process interactions and enable proactive decision-making at the machine level. The results on benchmark models demonstrate measurable improvements and scalability, with potential for further gains on larger deployments.

Abstract: In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production
resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in
semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize
actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and
recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot
easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can
gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural
network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines,
trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a
heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse
relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive
decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient
scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions.
  Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and
preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest
tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle

### [228] [Generalization and Optimization of SGD with Lookahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15776)
*Kangcheng Li,Yunwen Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lookahead with minibatch SGD improves generalization; the paper provides stability-based generalization bounds without requiring Lipschitzness and shows a linear speedup with batch size in convex settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand Lookahead's generalization behavior, removing restrictive Lipschitz assumptions and linking optimization to generalization via on-average stability.

Method: Apply on-average model stability analysis to Lookahead with minibatch SGD; derive generalization bounds for convex and strongly convex settings without global Lipschitzness; analyze dependence on batch size.

Result: Established generalization bounds; demonstrated linear speedup with batch size in the convex case; extends stability-based theory to Lookahead.

Conclusion: The Lookahead optimizer with SGD attains provable generalization improvements under weaker assumptions, revealing a clearer optimization-generalization trade-off and encouraging larger batches in convex regimes.

Abstract: The Lookahead optimizer enhances deep learning models by employing a
dual-weight update mechanism, which has been shown to improve the performance
of underlying optimizers such as SGD. However, most theoretical studies focus
on its convergence on training data, leaving its generalization capabilities
less understood. Existing generalization analyses are often limited by
restrictive assumptions, such as requiring the loss function to be globally
Lipschitz continuous, and their bounds do not fully capture the relationship
between optimization and generalization. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting a rigorous stability and generalization analysis of the Lookahead
optimizer with minibatch SGD. We leverage on-average model stability to derive
generalization bounds for both convex and strongly convex problems without the
restrictive Lipschitzness assumption. Our analysis demonstrates a linear
speedup with respect to the batch size in the convex setting.

### [229] [Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts for Protein Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15796)
*Xuefeng Liu,Mingxuan Cao,Songhao Jiang,Xiao Luo,Xiaotian Duan,Mengdi Wang,Tobin R. Sosnick,Jinbo Xu,Rick Stevens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MCTD-ME, a diffusion-based Monte Carlo Tree Search framework with multiple experts for protein design, enabling multi-token planning and improved exploration that outperforms baselines on inverse folding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language-model-based planners paired with MCTS struggle with long-range dependencies and remain limited by a combinatorially large search space. There is a need for a planning framework that can revise multiple residues jointly and leverage diverse predictive experts under biophysically faithful guidance.

Method: MCTD-ME fuses masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning. It uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine to jointly revise multiple positions. A pLDDT-based masking schedule targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. A novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to ensembles of experts, guiding exploration with diverse capacities. The framework is model-agnostic.

Result: On inverse folding tasks (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with larger gains for longer proteins and improved by multi-expert guidance.

Conclusion: The approach is generalizable beyond inverse folding, applicable to de novo protein design and multi-objective molecular generation, and demonstrates that combining diffusion-based rollout with evolutionary-like tree search and expert ensembles yields more efficient, higher-fidelity exploration of large sequence spaces.

Abstract: The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into
functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining
autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle
with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search
space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts,
which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token
planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME
uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine,
jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It
further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided
by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while
preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule
(PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse
folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and
unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity
(scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from
multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and
applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and
multi-objective molecular generation.

### [230] [Instance Generation for Meta-Black-Box Optimization through Latent Space Reverse Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15810)
*Chen Wang,Zeyuan Ma,Zhiguang Cao,Yue-Jiao Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSRE generates Diverse-BBO by mapping problem features to a 2D latent space with an autoencoder, performing uniform grid sampling to capture diversity, and using genetic programming to search for function formulas with minimal L2-distance to these latent representations to reverse-engineer a diversified problem set. Training MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO yields improved generalization on synthetic and realistic scenarios compared to traditional training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MetaBBO training relies on limited-diversity benchmarks (e.g., CoCo-BBOB), risking overfitting and poor generalization of learned optimization policies to unseen problems.

Method: Train an autoencoder to project high-dimensional problem features into a 2D latent space. Do uniform-grid sampling in latent space to obtain diverse latent representations. Use genetic programming to search for function formulas whose outputs lie near these latent representations (minimizing L2 distance), thereby reverse-engineering a diversified set of BBO problems, termed Diverse-BBO. Train MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and evaluate generalization on synthetic and realistic scenarios. Conduct ablations to analyze design choices.

Result: MetaBBOs trained on Diverse-BBO demonstrate superior generalization to both synthetic and realistic problem scenarios compared with models trained on traditional training sets like CoCo-BBOB. Extensive experiments corroborate the benefits of Diverse-BBO, and ablation studies shed light on the roles of LSRE components and the relationship between instance diversity and generalization.

Conclusion: LSRE provides an effective pipeline for generating diversified training instances for MetaBBO, mitigating overfitting to narrow benchmarks and enhancing generalization of learned optimization policies. The Diverse-BBO framework also offers insights into how instance diversity influences MetaBBO performance.

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization
algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

### [231] [ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815)
*Yinglong Zou,Juan Zhai,Chunrong Fang,Zhenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThermalGuardian: a temperature-aware automotive DL framework testing approach that mutates models, simulates GPU temperature via Newton's law of cooling, and adapts GPU frequency in real time to uncover temperature-induced quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving DL deployments face extreme temps (-40 to 50 C) causing GPU temperature fluctuations and DVFS-driven frequency changes; existing framework tests ignore these effects, leading to unaddressed delays, precision errors, and synchronization problems.

Method: 1) Generate test inputs by mutating models to target temperature-sensitive operators; 2) simulate GPU temperature fluctuations using Newton's law of cooling; 3) regulate GPU frequency in real time based on measured temperature; 4) observe and report quality issues (delays, precision errors, sync problems) for framework components.

Result: First automotive DL framework testing method under temperature-varying environments; demonstrates detection of temperature-induced issues and provides a pathway to more robust automotive deployment.

Conclusion: Temperature-aware testing is essential for safe automotive DL systems; ThermalGuardian fills a critical gap and should be extended to broader hardware and framework contexts.

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems,
supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate
model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive
deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT
in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,
vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from
-40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,
heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.
These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments
through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks
are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency
variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer
critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,
high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series
operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot
be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they
ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge
this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning
framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,
ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules
targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature
fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based
on real-time GPU temperature.

### [232] [On the Convergence of Muon and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15816)
*Da Chang,Yongxiang Liu,Ganzhao Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variance-reduced Muon variant Muon-VR2 achieves the optimal convergence rate for stochastic non-convex optimization, O~(T^{-1/3}), addressing the gap between practice and theory in Muon and matching the lower bound; also extends convergence guarantees under PL condition and validates findings empirically. This is the first optimality proof for a Muon-style optimizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between the strong empirical performance of Muon and its theoretical understanding. The standard Muon variant converges at O(T^{-1/4}) in stochastic non-convex settings, leaving room to explore whether a faster, optimal rate is possible within the Muon framework. The work aims to close this gap by developing a variance-reduced Muon variant and proving its optimal rate.

Method: Introduce Muon-VR2, a variance-reduced Muon-style optimizer. Provide rigorous convergence analysis showing an optimal rate of ~O(T^{-1/3}) for stochastic non-convex problems. Extend the analysis to cases satisfying the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition. Conduct experiments on vision (CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks to corroborate per-iteration convergence behavior.

Result: Muon-VR2 is proven to achieve the optimal convergence rate ~O(T^{-1/3}) in the stochastic non-convex setting, matching lower bounds. The analysis also yields convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the PL condition. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and C4 align with the theoretical convergence trends, supporting the claimed optimality and practical efficiency.

Conclusion: This work provides the first proof of optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the pathway to designing more efficient, accelerated variants within the Muon framework.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling
matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a
significant gap persists between its practical performance and theoretical
understanding. Existing analyses indicate that the standard Muon variant
achieves only a suboptimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in
stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To
explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we construct and analyze
a variance-reduced variant, termed Muon-VR2. We provide the first rigorous
proof that incorporating a variance-reduction mechanism enables Muon-VR2 to
attain an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby
matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Moreover, our
analysis establishes convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision
(CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on
per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work provides the first proof of
optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing
more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

### [233] [SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827)
*Baptiste Schubnel,Jelena Simeunović,Corentin Tissier,Pierre-Jean Alet,Rafael E. Carrillo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SolarCrossFormer is a graph-based, cross-modal deep learning model for day-ahead, high-resolution solar irradiance forecasting in Switzerland, coupling satellite imagery with ground-based time series to produce probabilistic 15-minute forecasts up to 24 hours ahead. It is robust to new data and capable of forecasting at locations with only coordinates; performance on 1 year, 127 locations yields NM A E of 6.1%, competitive with commercial NWP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for forecasts with finer temporal/spatial resolution for grid-scale PV integration; existing solutions do not provide enough resolution or robustness in real-world operations.

Method: A novel graph neural network framework that fuses satellite images and ground-station time series to exploit inter- and intra-modal correlations. It provides probabilistic forecasts at 15-minute resolution up to 24 hours, can incorporate new data without retraining, and can forecast for locations with only coordinates by using their spatial location.

Result: On a dataset spanning one year and 127 Swiss locations, SolarCrossFormer achieved a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 6.1% over the horizon, and its performance is competitive with a commercial numerical weather prediction service.

Conclusion: SolarCrossFormer demonstrates robust, high-resolution day-ahead irradiance forecasting with flexible input modalities and applicability to unobserved locations, offering a practical solution for grid operators. Future work may address generalization to other regions, computational efficiency, and integration with operation-grade decision systems.

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid.
However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution
required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a
novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines
satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological
stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the
inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy
and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any
location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours
ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real
life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the
model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input
data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of
one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield
a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The
results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather
prediction service.

*Ning Xu,Junkai Zhang,Yang Wu,Huigen Ye,Hua Xu,Huiling Xu,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid policy-based adaptive search (HyP-ASO) for large-scale ILPs, blending a customized formula with deep RL to guide neighborhood generation; achieves strong performance and scalability compared to LNS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ILPs are NP-hard; solving large-scale ILPs with traditional solvers is slow. LNS-based methods help but struggle to generate effective neighborhoods; need a method that combines domain-guided heuristics with learning to improve neighborhood quality and scalability.

Method: Integrates a customized formula that uses feasible solutions to compute selection probabilities for variables in neighborhood generation; a deep reinforcement learning policy predicts the appropriate neighborhood size; together form HyP-ASO for adaptive search.

Result: Extensive experiments show HyP-ASO significantly outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs; also demonstrates lightweight and high scalability.

Conclusion: HyP-ASO offers an effective, scalable approach for large-scale ILPs by combining domain-informed neighborhood generation with learning-based size prediction; suitable for practical large-scale ILP solving.

Abstract: Directly solving large-scale Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using traditional
solvers is slow due to their NP-hard nature. While recent frameworks based on
Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their
performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently
effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a
hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a
customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages
feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable
in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the
neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly
outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional
experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited
for solving large-scale ILPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoBrain advances seizure detection by using explicit dynamic graphs and time-then-graph modeling, outperforming static/dynamic GNN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based seizure detection requires capturing evolving brain connectivity; static graphs and weakly interacting temporal-graph modeling limit performance.

Method: Introduce EvoBrain: two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by Laplacian Positional Encoding; explicit dynamic graphs where nodes and edges evolve over time; theoretical analysis shows expressivity advantages of dynamic modeling and time-then-graph approach.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains: AUROC +23%, F1 +30% over dynamic GNN baseline; validated on early seizure prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamics are beneficial for EEG seizure detection; EvoBrain provides a practical, effective framework for capturing seizure dynamics.

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Tsururu offers a practical framework to select training approaches and assemble forecasting models, reducing the gap between research developments and industry deployment.

Abstract: While current time series research focuses on developing new models, crucial
questions of selecting an optimal approach for training such models are

TL;DR: A geometry-aware, privacy-preserving multi-view clustering framework (HKD-based) for distributed healthcare data, introducing HK-MVFC and FedHK-MVFC, with convergence guarantees and differential privacy, achieving improved clustering accuracy and reduced communication in federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate, privacy-preserving collaborative clustering of heterogeneous medical data across institutions by leveraging geometry-aware similarities via heat kernel distances, addressing data silos and HIPAA/privacy constraints.

Method: Introduce Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) to transform Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarities. Develop two algorithms: HK-MVFC for centralized multi-view fuzzy clustering and FedHK-MVFC for federated learning with differential privacy and secure aggregation. Provide update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols.

Result: On synthetic cardiovascular datasets: 8–12% improvement in clustering accuracy, 70% reduction in communication, and 98.2% efficiency retention compared with centralized methods.

Conclusion: Presents a geometry-aware federated learning framework for healthcare that balances rigorous mathematics with clinical relevance, enabling privacy-preserving multi-view clustering with convergence guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced

Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new

math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

TL;DR: Introduces a large, public leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the full diagnostic process, plus baseline AI methods for detection, classification, and diagnosis with strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual bone marrow analysis for leukemia is slow and relies on private datasets; a large, public, end-to-end dataset is needed to benchmark and advance AI in the diagnostic pipeline.

Method: Assembles a public dataset of 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical, and laboratory data; collects over 40,000 cells with bounding boxes and more than 28,000 high-quality class labels; proposes methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction; evaluates models using AP for detection, AUC, F1 for 33-class classification, and mean F1 for diagnosis from predicted cell counts.

Result: Cell detection AP = 0.96; AUC = 0.98; 33-class cell classification F1 = 0.61; diagnosis prediction mean F1 = 0.90.

Conclusion: This dataset is the most comprehensive public resource for leukemia bone marrow AI research, enabling broader benchmarking and potential improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

*Nakul Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight framework using Vision Foundation Models' latent space to synthesize data and train a linear classifier for long-tail classification, achieving state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100-LT and strong results on Places-LT with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets bias models and degrade performance on underrepresented classes. While fine-tuning foundation models has shown promise, it remains computationally expensive and often doesn't close the gap to models trained on balanced data. Hence there is a need for a simple, efficient method that leverages rich semantic representations.

Method: Leverage the semantic latent space of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data. Combine real and synthetic data to train a simple linear classifier, with trainable parameters limited to those of the linear model, thereby achieving computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on CIFAR-100-LT and strong performance on Places-LT, demonstrating that a simple, efficient approach can match or exceed heavier fine-tuning methods on long-tail benchmarks.

Conclusion: A simple, parameter-efficient framework that uses synthetic data from foundation-model latent spaces can effectively address long-tail classification, offering strong performance with substantially reduced computational load and wide adaptability.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

*Remo Sasso,Michelangelo Conserva,Dominik Jeurissen,Paulo Rauber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models enable more sample-efficient RL via two strategies: foundation world models (FWMs) for simulated interactions and foundation agents (FAs) for reasoning-driven decisions; evaluated in LLM-friendly grid-worlds, showing LLMS improvements boost both; FAs excel in simple tasks and FWMs + RL show promise in complex partially observable stochastic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sample efficiency is crucial for real-world RL; FMs offer prior knowledge and reasoning to improve data efficiency; exploring FWMs and FAs can leverage LLM capabilities for better agents.

Method: Two strategies: (1) FWMs that embed FM knowledge to train/evaluate agents in simulated interactions; (2) FAs that use FM reasoning during decision-making. Empirical evaluation in a family of grid-world environments tailored to current LLM capabilities; analysis of how improvements in LLMs affect FWMs and FAs.

Result: LLM improvements translate into better FWMs and FAs; FAs based on current LLMs can yield excellent policies in simple environments; the combination of FWMs and RL holds high potential for more complex tasks with partial observability and stochasticity.

Conclusion: Integrating foundation models into RL via FWMs and FAs is a promising direction for sample-efficient, robust agents; future work should explore scaling to richer environments and further coupling strategies.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning from scratch has shown impressive results in
solving sequential decision-making tasks with efficient simulators, real-world
applications with expensive interactions require more sample-efficient agents.
Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as
they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear
how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In
this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising
strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that
exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents
with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents
(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We
evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments
that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).
Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better
FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent
policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs
and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings
with partial observability and stochastic elements.

### [241] [ToFU: Transforming How Federated Learning Systems Forget User Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15861)
*Van-Tuan Tran,Hong-Hanh Nguyen-Le,Quoc-Viet Pham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ToFU: a learning-to-unlearn, transformation-guided federated unlearning framework that integrates transformations during training to bound memorization, acting as a plug-and-play improvement for FU methods and achieving faster, stronger unlearning on CIFAR-10/100 and MUFAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks memorize training data, causing privacy risks in federated learning; post-hoc unlearning is inefficient for deeply memorized information; need for FL systems designed to forget.

Method: Introduce ToFU framework that uses transformations during training to limit instance-specific information; provide theoretical analysis showing transformation composition bounds memorized information and eases subsequent unlearning; can be used as a plug-in with existing FU methods.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MUFAC shows ToFU outperforms existing FU baselines, improves performance when integrated with current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

Conclusion: Advocates a paradigm shift toward designing FL systems inherently amenable to forgetting; ToFU offers a general, plug-and-play approach to reduce memorization and accelerate unlearning, with strong empirical support.

Abstract: Neural networks unintentionally memorize training data, creating privacy
risks in federated learning (FL) systems, such as inference and reconstruction
attacks on sensitive data. To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy
regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable
participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global
model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to
efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue
that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems
inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a
learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework
that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce
memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how
transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information,
directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a
plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU
outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with
current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

### [242] [Enhancing Generative Auto-bidding with Offline Reward Evaluation and Policy Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15927)
*Zhiyu Mou,Yiqin Lv,Miao Xu,Cheems Wang,Yixiu Mao,Qichen Ye,Chao Li,Rongquan Bai,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIGB-Pearl enhances AI-generated bidding by adding a non-bootstrapped trajectory evaluator that guides planning via RL, leveraging LLM-based scoring, hybrid losses, and adaptive expert feedback to achieve state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGB methods suffer from coarse quality evaluation and inability to generalize beyond static offline datasets, limiting performance and stability.

Method: Introduce a trajectory evaluator that is iteratively refined through interaction (planning with evaluator via RL). Key components include an LLM-based architecture for the evaluator, hybrid point-wise and pair-wise score losses, and adaptive integration of expert feedback to improve generalization. The framework combines generative planning with policy optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluation on simulated and real-world advertising systems shows state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing offline RL-based auto-bidding methods.

Conclusion: AIGB-Pearl effectively closes the gap between planning quality and policy optimization by incorporating an evaluative loop, enabling better generation quality and generalization in AI-generated bidding.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is an essential tool for advertisers to enhance their
advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding
(AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and
trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior
and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning
(RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter
a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation
quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address
this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel
method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to
AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to
assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its
generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance
trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key
techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better
representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for
better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for
better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our approach.

### [243] [SAGE: Semantic-Aware Shared Sampling for Efficient Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15865)
*Haoran Zhao,Tong Bai,Lei Huang,Xiaoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE introduces semantic-aware shared sampling to reduce diffusion model sampling cost by sharing early steps across semantically similar queries, achieving efficiency gains with maintained or improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models incur high sampling cost due to dozens of sequential steps. Prior work speeds up sampling per query but treats queries independently, missing cross-query reuse opportunities. There is a need to reduce total steps without harming quality.

Method: Propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling framework that combines a shared sampling scheme for efficiency with a tailored training strategy to preserve generation quality across queries.

Result: SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5% and improves generation quality compared with baselines: 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity.

Conclusion: Semantic-aware shared sampling enables meaningful cross-query reuse in diffusion models, achieving notable efficiency gains while enhancing or preserving generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their
high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a
major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized
solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we
reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across
semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without
sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling
framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a
tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show
that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality
with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over
baselines.

### [244] [The Alignment Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15932)
*Wenjun Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Capacity-constrained view of alignment: a two-stage U→H→Y model with cognitive and total capacity yields a single capacity that governs both Fano and PAC-Bayes bounds; label augmentation alone cannot beat the bound; improving performance on complex targets requires capacity growth ~ log M; aligned with the idea of interface engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by bounded rationality in economics and cognitive science, treating judgment as resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel to understand why alignment in language models deviates from intended behavior.

Method: Model the loop as a two-stage cascade U → H → Y given S, with cognitive capacity C_cog|S and average total capacity C_tot|S. Derive a capacity-coupled Alignment Performance Interval by combining (i) a data-size-independent Fano lower bound on a separable codebook mixture, and (ii) a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is controlled by m · C_tot|S. Under canonical observable loss and matched data-generating mixture, the PAC-Bayes bound tightens to the true risk; both bounds are governed by a single capacity.

Result: A single capacity parameter bounds both limits; with fixed value complexity and capacity, adding labels cannot cross the bound; to achieve lower risk on more complex targets, capacity must grow with log M; once signal saturates capacity, optimization tends to fit channel regularities (sycophancy and reward hacking).

Conclusion: Alignment should be treated as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity, manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

Abstract: Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still
exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded
rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as
resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model
the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive
capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity
$\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment
Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved
on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is
controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes
bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical
observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under
these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity.
Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding
labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex
targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal
saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities,
consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views
alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity,
manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

TL;DR: RLinf introduces macro-to-micro flow transformation to break down and recompose RL workflows for high-performance training, achieving 1.1x-2.13x throughput gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL training workflows are heterogeneous and dynamic, causing underutilization and slow training; current systems lack flexibility.

Method: Proposes M2Flow paradigm, macro-to-micro decomposition of workflows temporally and spatially; RLinf worker with adaptive communication enabling context switching and elastic pipelining; profiling-guided scheduling to optimize execution plans.

Result: RLinf outperforms state-of-the-art RL systems on reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks, with 1.1x-2.13x speedup in end-to-end throughput.

Conclusion: M2Flow-based RLinf effectively increases RL training efficiency by converting flexible workflows into optimized execution flows; potential broader applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing
artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied
intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL
workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing
systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system
based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training
lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is
built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow
transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,
easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and
recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's
adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic
pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling
policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both
reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in
end-to-end training throughput.

### [246] [Improving Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15929)
*Zhengyao Huang,Daniel Zhengyu Huang,Tiannan Xiao,Dina Ma,Zhenyu Ming,Hao Shi,Yuanhui Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An improved Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework for symbolic regression with two innovations: (i) an extreme bandit allocation strategy with finite-time guarantees under polynomial reward decay, and (ii) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions (mutation and crossover) to enable non-local search. This yields robust, efficient search and competitive recovery and Pareto-optimal accuracy/complexity on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression is a highly combinatorial problem where genetic programming dominates, and reinforcement learning methods have pursued search efficiency gains. MCTS can balance exploration and exploitation, but traditional bandit strategies and sequential, stepwise construction limit performance. The work aims to overcome these limitations to identify globally optimal expressions more efficiently.

Method: Introduce two core ideas: (1) extreme bandit allocation tuned for finding globally optimal expressions with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay; (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions, including mutation and crossover, enabling non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space and reshaping the reward landscape during search.

Result: Conducted thorough numerical studies to assess impact and benchmark against existing symbolic regression methods on diverse datasets (including ground-truth and black-box). The approach achieves competitive recovery rates with state-of-the-art libraries and attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves robustness and efficiency of symbolic regression search. Code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical
expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a
highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been
the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning
methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with
its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has
emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However,
its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often
limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for
symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key
innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying
globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under
polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping
actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to
promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape
the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and
efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these
improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression
methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box
datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto
frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at

### [247] [EmoHeal: An End-to-End System for Personalized Therapeutic Music Retrieval from Fine-grained Emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15986)
*Xinchen Wan,Jinhua Liang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmoHeal is an emotion-aware, three-stage digital-wellness system that personalizes content by detecting 27 emotions from text, mapping them to music-therapy-inspired parameters, and guiding users toward calmer states with audiovisual content; a small within-subjects study shows mood improvement and high perceived emotion-recognition accuracy, with strong link between perceived accuracy and outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in digital mental-wellness tools which remain static and one-size-fits-all. Pre-sleep anxiety affects over 1.5 billion people; a need exists for theory-driven, personalized, multi-modal interventions that adapt to individual emotional states using validated therapeutic principles.

Method: Detect 27 emotions from user text using a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model; map emotions to musical parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music-therapy principles (GEMS, iso-principle); retrieve audiovisual content with CLAMP3 to guide users from their current state toward a calmer state (match-guide-target); deliver end-to-end three-stage supportive narratives; within-subjects study (N=40).

Result: Significant supportive effects: mood improvement (M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion-recognition accuracy (M=4.05, p<0.001); strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001). Demonstrates viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital-wellness tools and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music-therapy principles.

Conclusion: EmoHeal validates a fine-grained, emotion-aware approach to digital wellness, grounded in music-therapy concepts, and offers a scalable framework for personalized, multi-modal emotion regulation interventions.

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

*Ibai Ramirez,Jokin Alcibar,Joel Pino,Mikel Sanz,David Pardo,Jose I. Aizpurua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) for probabilistic prognostics by embedding Bayesian Neural Networks within a PINN framework, using a heat-diffusion PDE residual to model ageing physics, and demonstrating improved uncertainty-aware predictions over a dropout-PINN baseline on transformer insulation ageing validated with FE models and real plant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of robust uncertainty quantification in SciML-based prognostics and the difficulty of integrating ageing PDEs into predictive models, by combining Bayesian neural networks with physics-informed learning to produce principled predictive uncertainty.

Method: Embed Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture to form a B-PINN. Use the heat diffusion PDE as the physics residual, and explore different prior distributions to study their impact on posterior predictive uncertainty. Validate against a finite element (FE) model calibrated with real measurements from a solar-power plant, and compare performance with a dropout-PINN baseline.

Result: B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty, outperforming dropout-PINN baselines in terms of uncertainty calibration and the robustness of maintenance decisions for critical power assets.

Conclusion: A principled, uncertainty-aware prognostics framework is feasible by integrating Bayesian neural networks with physics-informed neural networks, with priors encoding physical knowledge and improved reliability over non-Bayesian or dropout-based approaches.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the
learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely
data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics
remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial
differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust
uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic
prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN
architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware
predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where
insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat
diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior
distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior
distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The
framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with
real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a
dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable
prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This
capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance
decision-making in critical power assets.

*Mingdong Wu,Long Yang,Jin Liu,Weiyao Huang,Lehong Wu,Zelin Chen,Daolin Ma,Hao Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three-stage energy-based diffusion framework for in-hand pose estimation from CAD models, trained on simulated data, with a render-compare component to boost sim-to-real; achieves high accuracy, strong generalization to unseen CAD models, and can integrate tactile sensing, pose tracking, and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, generalizable in-hand pose estimation is critical for industrial tasks and consumer interactions, but existing methods struggle with unseen CAD models and sim-to-real gaps.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates; (2) iterative refinement of candidates; (3) post-ranking of final poses. All stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model trained solely on simulated data. The model outputs pose gradients for refinement and an energy scalar for pose quality. A render-compare architecture is incorporated within the energy-based score network to improve sim-to-real performance. The framework also integrates tactile pose estimation, pose tracking, and uncertainty estimation.

Result: Empirical results show the method outperforms regression, feature matching, and registration baselines. It exhibits strong intra-category generalization to unseen CAD models and demonstrates robustness across real-world conditions. Ablation confirms the render-compare component enhances sim-to-real performance.

Conclusion: The approach advances in-hand pose estimation by combining a diffusion-based energy model with a render-compare mechanism, enabling accurate, generalizable estimates trained entirely on simulated data and compatible with tactile sensing, tracking, and uncertainty estimation for robust real-world use.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from
positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting
devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression,
feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and
generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation.
The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by
iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final
stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is
trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates
gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that
quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea
from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture
within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real
performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on
regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong
intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and
uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance
across a variety of real-world conditions.

*Marko Tuononen,Heikki Penttinen,Ville Hautamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Influence functions are applied to a deep learning-based wireless receiver (DeepRx) to identify training samples that most affect bit predictions, enabling targeted fine-tuning that improves BER toward genie-aided performance; single-target gains are strong with loss-relative influence and BCE-like loss, but multi-target adaptation is challenging; the work also links to self-influence corrections and suggests a second-order update strategy; overall, influence functions serve as interpretability and an efficient adaptation tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bring interpretability and data-efficient adaptation to neural receivers by diagnosing how training data influences bit-level predictions and performance, addressing the gap in targeted data-centric improvements for wireless DL models.

Method: Apply influence functions to DeepRx; compute influence of training samples on bit predictions; use loss-relative influence with a capacity-like BCE loss; perform first-order updates on samples deemed beneficial; compare single-target vs multi-target adaptation; discuss self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update strategy.

Result: Loss-relative influence + first-order updates on beneficial samples consistently improve BER toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in single-target cases; multi-target adaptation less effective; influence functions provide interpretability and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

Conclusion: Influence functions are viable tools for interpreting and guiding data-driven receiver adaptation; future work includes better multi-target strategies and exploring second-order updates to further improve performance.

Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based
wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver,
influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions,
enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that
loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and
first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error
rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in
single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective,
underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to
self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update
strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability
tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

TL;DR: DL framework G-WindCast uses 5G GNSS signal strength variations to retrieve and forecast 3D wind fields, employing FNNs and Transformers; achieves competitive short-term accuracy with low GNSS station counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limited high-resolution wind data due to sparse observations, sensing limitations, and NWP biases; exploit non-traditional data sources for real-time wind monitoring.

Method: Map GNSS-derived features to 3D wind fields using Forward Neural Networks and Transformer networks; short-term forecasts up to 30 minutes; robust across forecast horizons and pressure levels; scalable with reduced GNSS stations (~100).

Result: Preliminary results show promising wind retrieval and short-term forecasting accuracy; skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP in certain scenarios; wind speed/direction predictions align better with observations than ERA5; robust across horizons/pressure; effective with ~100 GNSS stations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of non-traditional data and deep learning for real-time environmental monitoring, offering a cost-effective, scalable approach to atmospheric wind sensing and forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various
applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

*Zhangqi Jiang,Tingjin Luo,Xu Yang,Xinyan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces AGF-TI, a robust incomplete multi-view semi-supervised learning approach that combats sub-cluster problems via adversarial graph fusion and low-rank high-order tensor completion, with anchor-based efficiency and convergent optimization, outperforming SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In graph-based multi-view SSL, missing views distort local structures (creating sub-clusters), violating smoothness and hindering effective graph fusion and label propagation; a robust, scalable solution is needed to recover missing structure and fuse views.

Method: 1) Adversarial graph fusion with a min-max framework to learn a robust consensus graph; 2) Stack similarity matrices into a tensor and recover incomplete structure via low-rank tensor learning leveraging high-order consistency; 3) Anchor-based strategy to reduce computational complexity; 4) Efficient alternating optimization with reduced gradient descent and theoretical convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods; code is available at the listed GitHub repository.

Conclusion: AGF-TI effectively mitigates the Sub-Cluster Problem in incomplete multi-view SSL by robust graph fusion and structure recovery, offering scalable, convergent optimization and improved classification performance, with practical availability of code.

Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view
semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address
this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus
on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label
propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples
sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking
the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster
Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification
performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view
semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an
adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the
distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all
similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure
from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor
learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the
computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm
combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the
formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental
results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

### [253] [DiffusionNFT: Online Diffusion Reinforcement with Forward Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16117)
*Kaiwen Zheng,Huayu Chen,Haotian Ye,Haoxiang Wang,Qinsheng Zhang,Kai Jiang,Hang Su,Stefano Ermon,Jun Zhu,Ming-Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new online reinforcement learning framework for diffusion models that optimizes the forward process via flow matching, enabling implicit policy improvement with positive/negative generation comparisons. It is CFG-free, solver-agnostic, and more efficient than prior methods like FlowGRPO, achieving large gains in GenEval within few steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for diffusion models is hindered by intractable likelihoods and limitations of reverse-process discretization (solver constraints, forward-reverse inconsistency, CFG integration). There is a need for a likelihood-free, flexible online RL method that can utilize arbitrary solvers and reward signals.

Method: Train with flow matching on the forward diffusion process by contrasting positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction. The method does not estimate likelihoods, works with clean images, is solver-agnostic (can use black-box solvers), is CFG-free, and leverages multiple reward models to improve performance (e.g., SD3.5-Medium).

Result: DiffusionNFT is reported to be up to 25x more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons and CFG-free. It improved GenEval from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, whereas FlowGRPO reached 0.95 with over 5k steps and CFG usage.

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT provides an efficient, CFG-free online RL paradigm for diffusion models, directly optimizing the forward process via flow matching using positive/negative generation feedback, compatible with arbitrary solvers and enhanced by multiple reward models.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GA-based network optimization (GANet) on ATR-FTIR salivary spectra for ASD detection achieves 0.78 accuracy, 0.61 sensitivity, 0.90 specificity, and 0.74 harmonic mean, outperforming LDA, SVM, and some DL baselines.


<details>

Motivation: Address the lack of reliable biological markers for Autism Spectrum Disorder and the need for non-invasive, accurate early screening using high-dimensional salivary spectral data.

Method: GANet uses a genetic algorithm to optimize network structure with PageRank and Degree-based feature importance to extract patterns from high-dimensional ATR-FTIR spectra; compared against linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and deep learning models; evaluated on 159 saliva samples.

### [255] [Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Models for Learning Costs Applied to Route Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15999)
*Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes IO-LVM, a latent-variable inverse-optimization model that learns a distribution over COP cost functions and reconstructs feasible outputs by solving in a loop, enabling diverse, interpretable solution behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning COP representations is hard when costs are unknown and structured outputs must satisfy constraints; standard autoencoders struggle to enforce feasibility, so a model that captures multiple possible cost functions is desirable.

Method: Introduce IO-LVM that learns a latent space over COP cost functions from observed solutions, reconstructing outputs by solving a COP in the loop. It uses estimated gradients from a Fenchel-Young loss through a non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space, yielding a distribution rather than a single cost function.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets of ship and taxi routes and synthetic graph paths, showing the ability to reconstruct paths/cycles, predict their distributions, and provide interpretable latent representations of cost-function variations.

Conclusion: IO-LVM offers a principled way to represent multiple plausible COP cost functions and corresponding solutions, outperforming single-cost-function approaches by capturing diverse agent behaviors and conditions not seen during training.

Abstract: Learning representations for solutions of constrained optimization problems
(COPs) with unknown cost functions is challenging, as models like (Variational)
Autoencoders struggle to enforce constraints when decoding structured outputs.
We propose an Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Model (IO-LVM) that learns a
latent space of COP cost functions from observed solutions and reconstructs
feasible outputs by solving a COP with a solver in the loop. Our approach
leverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a
non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike
standard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which
typically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a
distribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse
solution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available
during the training process. We validate our method on real-world datasets of
ship and taxi routes, as well as paths in synthetic graphs, demonstrating its
ability to reconstruct paths and cycles, predict their distributions, and yield
interpretable latent representations.

*R. O. Lane,W. J. Holmes,C. J. Taylor,H. M. State-Davey,A. J. Wragge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A ML pipeline analyzes and tracks online statements to detect extremism/terrorism risk. It encodes text with Universal Sentence Encoder, uses SVM classification, and tracks temporal trends; achieves high accuracy on a small dataset and shows detecting shifts around major events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically identify and monitor extremist or terrorist rhetoric in online content to support risk assessment and research, combining text embeddings with time-series tracking.

Method: Data: quotes from wikiquote.org across terrorists, extremists, campaigners, and politicians. Features: 512-d embeddings from Universal Sentence Encoder. Model: SVM with 10-fold cross-validation. Baseline: n-gram features. Tracking: temporal analysis treating quotes as noisy measurements of a person’s state of mind to detect trends and event-driven changes.

Result: SVM accuracy: extremism 81%, terrorism 97% on 839 quotes, outperforming a baseline using n-grams. Tracking reveals trends and sharp attitude shifts corresponding to major events.

Conclusion: Feasible to automatically detect and track extremist/terrorist rhetoric; shows promise for monitoring and analysis, with caveats about dataset size, generalizability, and potential ethical considerations.

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

### [257] [Time-adaptive SympNets for separable Hamiltonian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16026)
*Konrad Janik,Peter Benner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extension of TSympNets to time-adaptive, non-autonomous Hamiltonians; establishes universal approximation for separable Hamiltonians, but not for non-separable; includes numerical experiments and a corrected proof in symplectic map approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregularly sampled data and the need for time-adaptive symplectic integrators for Hamiltonian systems; existing fixed-step symplectic nets (e.g., SympNets, H"enonNets) are limited.

Method: Adapt TSympNets architecture to non-autonomous (time-dependent) and separable Hamiltonians; prove a universal approximation theorem for separable systems; show non-extendability to non-separable systems; conduct numerical experiments; fix an error in the proof of a major theorem (Theorem 2 in [25]) on approximating symplectic maps.

Result: Proves universal approximation for separable Hamiltonians; demonstrates impossibility to extend the result to non-separable Hamiltonians; numerical experiments illustrate approximation capabilities; corrects a substantial theorem's proof for symplectic map approximation in symplectic ML.

Conclusion: TSympNets can theoretically approximate all separable time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics (universal property) but not the general non-separable case; theoretical boundary clarified and empirically supported; a previously identified proof error is corrected, strengthening the foundation for symplectic ML methods.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly i.e. not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [20] and
H\'enonNets [4] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we
call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets
and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation
qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal
approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not
possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems. To investigate
these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical
experiments. Furthermore we fix a mistake in a proof of a substantial theorem
[25, Theorem 2] for the approximation of symplectic maps in general, but
specifically for symplectic machine learning methods.

*Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero,David Anton,Laura De Lorenzis,Henning Wessels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nine algorithm-criterion combinations for automated constitutive model discovery via sparse regression; demonstrates robust performance across isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity with synthetic and experimental datasets, expanding beyond LASSO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from manual, expert-calibrated constitutive models to automated data-driven discovery, and to systematically evaluate how sparsity, predictive accuracy, and computational cost trade off across different sparse regression solvers and model selection criteria.

Method: Combine three sparse regression solvers (LASSO, LARS, OMP) with three model selection criteria (CV, AIC, BIC) to form nine algorithm-criterion pairs; use LARS as an efficient path-based solver for l1-constrained problems and OMP as a heuristic for l0-regularized selection; apply to isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic materials using both synthetic and experimental datasets.

Result: All nine algorithm-criterion combinations performed consistently well in discovering accurate constitutive models for isotropic and anisotropic materials; results suggest a broader set of viable discovery algorithms beyond L1-based methods like LASSO.

Conclusion: The proposed framework broadens the toolbox for data-driven constitutive model discovery, enabling robust performance across multiple solver-criterion combinations and highlighting trade-offs among sparsity, predictive accuracy, and computational cost.

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials,
yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range
of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

### [259] [SABER: Uncovering Vulnerabilities in Safety Alignment via Cross-Layer Residual Connection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16060)
*Maithili Joshi,Palash Nandi,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SABER is a white-box jailbreak that bypasses safety alignment by adding a residual path between intermediate transformer layers, yielding a ~51% improvement over the best baseline on HarmBench with minimal perplexity impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with safety alignment remain vulnerable to jailbreaks; safety mechanisms are largely in middle-to-late layers; exposing and validating this vulnerability through a potent attack.

Method: Introduce SABER: insert a residual connection between two intermediate layers s and e (s < e) to bypass safety constraints, enabling harmful outputs without triggering safety filters.

Result: Achieves 51% improvement over the strongest HarmBench baseline; only a marginal shift in perplexity on the HarmBench validation set.

Conclusion: Safety alignment appears concentrated in certain layers; a white-box residual bypass can undermine it. The work underscores the need for more robust, cross-layer safety integration and evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

*Yi Xu,Yitian Zhang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMAE is a dual-task masked autoencoder for unsupervised multivariate time series, jointly reconstructing masked values and predicting latent features with a teacher encoder, plus a feature-level alignment constraint; it yields superior downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised representation learning for multivariate time series (MTS) to obtain compact, transferable representations without labels, addressing the need for temporally coherent and semantically rich features for diverse tasks.

Method: DMAE performs two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstruct masked values based on visible attributes; (2) estimate latent representations of masked features guided by a teacher encoder. It adds a feature-level alignment constraint to align predicted latent representations with the teacher's outputs, and jointly optimizes these objectives to learn temporally coherent representations.

Result: Extensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks show consistent and superior performance of DMAE over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: DMAE demonstrates that dual masking with latent prediction guided by a teacher and feature-level alignment yields high-quality, transferable representations for unsupervised MTS, improving performance across diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReaSyn introduces chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation and reinforcement-learning‑finetuned generative modeling to perform synthesizable projection and optimization. It learns step‑by‑step reaction reasoning, achieving higher reconstruction, pathway diversity, and goal‑directed optimization in the chemically synthesizable space, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular generative models often fail to guarantee synthesizability due to the enormous, combinatorial chemical space. There is a need for methods that explicitly leverage synthetic pathways to generate synthesizable analogs and to optimize them effectively.

Method: Represent synthetic pathways with chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation to provide dense, step‑by‑step supervision of reactions during supervised training. Use reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning and goal-directed test-time compute scaling to enhance reasoning and search within the synthesizable space, enabling trajectory-based exploration around given molecules.

Result: ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization performance in synthesizable goal‑directed molecular optimization, and significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in synthesizable hit expansion.

Conclusion: ReaSyn demonstrates superior capability to navigate the exponentially large space of synthesizable molecules by integrating CoR-based reasoning with RL finetuning, enabling effective synthesizable projection and optimization.

Abstract: A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not
guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable
attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large
combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown
limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To
tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for
synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given
molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in
synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the
synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic
pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the
chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction
types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR
notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly
learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform
step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning
capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning
and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable
projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway
diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization
performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and
significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in
synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability
to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

*Emmanouil Seferis,Changshun Wu,Stefanos Kollias,Saddek Bensalem,Chih-Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends randomized smoothing to generative models by mapping outputs to an oracle classification task, enabling robustness certificates for discrete actions, harm-vs-harmless judgments, or clustering; derives sample-to-radius scaling laws and shows strong reductions in required samples under weaker assumptions, validated against adversarial jailbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness certification for generative models remains underdeveloped. Randomized smoothing is well-understood for classifiers but not for sequence outputs; there is a need for principled guarantees for VLMs and related models that produce discrete decisions or clusters.

Method: Map generative outputs to an oracle classifier task (e.g., discrete action, harmful vs. harmless, cluster assignment). Assume bounded oracle error. Develop theory linking the number of smoothing samples to the certified robustness radius. Derive improved scaling laws relating certified radius and accuracy to sample count, and show these hold under weaker assumptions. Validate the framework against jailbreak-style adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: Theoretical framework ties sample count to a certified radius for generative outputs via an oracle classification mapping. Improved scaling laws show two to three orders of magnitude fewer samples are sufficient with minimal loss. Empirical validation demonstrates robustness certification can be computed for modern VLMs and resists jailbreak-style attacks.

Conclusion: Randomized smoothing can be meaningfully extended to generative models, yielding well-defined, computationally feasible robustness certificates for VLMs across discrete actions, safety judgments, and semantic clustering; this broadens reliable deployment against adversarial and jailbreak-style threats.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the
correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness
certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for
classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their
outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting
generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can
still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action
(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content
moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster
answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the
oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates
the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further
derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and
accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3
orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid
even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness
certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for
state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial
attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust personalized federated learning method using heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means with tensor decompositions (Tucker and CP) for privacy-preserving federated aggregation with low-rank tensor representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle high-dimensional, multi-view data in federated settings by enabling personalized models, robust clustering, and communication-efficient learning while preserving privacy.

Method: A dual-level optimization: (1) local stage with heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering using tensor decomposition on order-N tensors (Tucker + CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to discover client-specific patterns; (2) global stage federated aggregation of tensor factors (core tensors and factor matrices) with differential privacy; tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transforms and low-rank approximations for efficiency and privacy across clients.

Result: Anticipated improvements include better personalization across clients, robust discovery of nonlinear multi-view structures, privacy-preserving aggregation, and reduced communication due to low-rank tensor representations.

Conclusion: The tensorized approach enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning on high-dimensional multi-view data, balancing personalization, clustering robustness, and communication efficiency.

Abstract: We present a robust personalized federated learning framework that leverages
heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering with
advanced tensor decomposition techniques. Our approach integrates heat-kernel
coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and
canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional
distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view
structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to
facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via
N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level
optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor
decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of
tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local
stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker
decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data,
while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors
and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving
protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of
high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through
low-rank tensor approximations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic, prompt-dependent CFG scheduling for diffusion models uses online feedback from multiple evaluators (CLIP, a fidelity discriminator, and a human reward model) to greedily choose per-timestep guidance scales, improving alignment, quality, and reasoning vs static CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static CFG scales are inflexible and fail to adapt to diverse prompts; prior fixes add complexity and poor generalization. A dynamic, data-driven approach is needed.

Method: At each diffusion step, obtain online feedback from a suite of evaluators (general-purpose CLIP for alignment, a fidelity/discriminator, and a human preference reward model) to assess generation quality; perform greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for that timestep; apply per-prompt/sample schedules; validate on small-scale models and Imagen 3.

Result: Significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning; up to 53.8% human preference win-rate over the Imagen 3 baseline, up to 55.5% on prompts targeting text rendering.

Conclusion: Optimal guidance schedules are inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent; the proposed framework provides an efficient, generalizable way to achieve dynamic CFG scheduling across models and prompts.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning surrogate (MSTM) predicts seven coupled fields in shock-porous/architected materials, trained on hydrocode data. It runs ~1000x faster than direct simulation, with errors <4% (porous) and <10% (lattice), while preserving global quantities and sharp shock fronts, enabling practical design studies for planetary defense, inertial fusion energy, and national security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating in shocked porous and architected materials is challenging. Existing single-field or reduced surrogates fail to capture sharp shocks and coupled field dynamics, hindering design studies for asteroid deflection, inertial fusion, and related security applications.

Method: Introduce MSTM, a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model that unifies seven coupled fields—pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components—into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, it predicts the evolution of all fields. It outpaces direct simulation by ~1000x and preserves essential integral quantities.

Result: MSTM achieves errors below 4% in porous materials and below 10% in lattice structures; it resolves sharp shock fronts and preserves mass-averaged pressure and temperature to within 5%. It enables large-scale, tractable design studies by providing accurate, fast surrogate predictions for meso-structured materials under extreme loading.

Conclusion: This approach transforms previously intractable shock-combination problems into practical design tools for planetary impact mitigation, inertial fusion energy, and national security, by delivering an accurate, fast, multi-field surrogate that handles complex material responses.

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected
materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the
race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous
Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the
success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major
challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.
We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that
unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,
material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single
autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs
about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below
4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior
single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts
while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and
temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered
intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework
for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,
inertial fusion energy, and national security.

### [266] [Automated Cyber Defense with Generalizable Graph-based Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16151)
*Isaiah J. King,Benjamin Bowman,H. Howie Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-based deep reinforcement learning for automated cyber defense (ACD) that uses a two-player context-based partially observable MDP with graph-structured observations. The relational inductive bias enables zero-shot generalization to unseen networks and outperforms state-of-the-art defenses across diverse, multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for ACD overfit to fixed network topologies and fail under perturbations. Representing networks as attributed graphs and reasoning relationally should improve generalization to unseen topologies and adversaries.

Method: Formulate ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable MDP with observations as attributed graphs. Agents act by editing the graph representing the environment, leveraging relational inductive bias to reason about host interactions and system entities in a generalizable way; evaluated in multi-agent settings across varied networks and adversaries.

Result: The graph-based, relationally biased DRL approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin and enables zero-shot adaptation to never-before-seen networks and adversaries in complex, multi-agent environments.

Conclusion: Relational inductive bias via graph-based DRL improves generalization for automated cyber defense, enabling effective defense on unseen networks and across diverse adversaries.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for
automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks
as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,
these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering
them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In
this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable
Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.
This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational
inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other
system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as
edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we
will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and
zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending
never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of
complex, and multi-agent environments.

### [267] [DIVEBATCH: Accelerating Model Training Through Gradient-Diversity Aware Batch Size Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16173)
*Yuen Chen,Yian Wang,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive batch-size SGD (DiveBatch) uses gradient diversity to balance convergence speed and generalization, achieving 1.06–5x speedups with modest accuracy trade-offs on CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large-scale deep neural networks is computationally expensive. Fixed-batch SGD often sacrifices speed or generalization. An adaptive, data-driven batch-size strategy aims to combine fast convergence with good generalization.

Method: Introduce DiveBatch, an adaptive batch-size SGD that dynamically adjusts batch size based on gradient diversity. Grounded in SGD convergence theory, it seeks to preserve small-batch generalization while leveraging large-batch efficiency. Evaluated on synthetic data and standard vision benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet).

Result: DiveBatch converges significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch, achieving ~1.06–5.0x faster convergence with a slight trade-off in performance.

Conclusion: Gradient diversity provides a principled basis for adaptive batch sizing. DiveBatch offers practical speedups while maintaining generalization comparable to small-batch training.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to accelerate the training of machine learning
models, a critical challenge since the training of large-scale deep neural
models can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
its variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to
traditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a
novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts
the batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes
is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often
converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we
introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling
DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training
while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient
diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the
convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and
CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges
significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a
slight trade-off in performance.

### [268] [Latent learning: episodic memory complements parametric learning by enabling flexible reuse of experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16189)
*Andrew Kyle Lampinen,Martin Engelcke,Yuxuan Li,Arslan Chaudhry,James L. McClelland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study argues that latent learning and episodic-memory-inspired retrieval can improve ML generalization; an oracle retrieval mechanism shows generalization gains across diverse tasks, with within-example in-context learning identified as key; retrieval can complement parametric learning to address data inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems often fail to generalize due to not acquiring latent information useful for future tasks. By drawing on cognitive science—especially episodic memory and retrieval—the paper investigates generalization failures like the reversal curse and navigation tasks.

Method: Proposes an oracle retrieval mechanism and analyzes how learning experiences are reused to generalize; emphasizes the role of within-example in-context learning to enable cross-retrieved information usage across examples; connects findings to language modeling and agent-based navigation.

Result: Retrieval with access to stored experiences enables more flexible generalization across multiple challenges; identifies essential components for effective retrieval and highlights within-example in-context learning as crucial for leveraging retrieved information across examples.

Conclusion: Retrieval methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization, helping to close the data inefficiency gap between current ML systems and natural intelligence.

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

### [269] [Inverting Trojans in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16203)
*Zhengxing Li,Guangmingmei Yang,Jayaram Raghuram,David J. Miller,George Kesidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A discrete, greedy trigger-search and implicit blacklisting framework enables reliable backdoor trigger detection and inversion in LLMs, addressing discrete input space, combinatorial trigger search, and lack of good blacklists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To port backdoor detection/inversion from image models to LLMs, overcoming the discrete token space, enormous candidate trigger combinations, and the need to blacklist tokens without reliable domain-specific whitelists.

Method: Three components: (i) discrete search with greedy accretion of triggers starting from a small singleton set; (ii) implicit blacklisting by evaluating average cosine similarity in activation space between a candidate trigger and a clean set of samples from the target class; (iii) detection via high misclassification rate and high decision confidence when a candidate trigger elicits the target response.

Result: Empirically demonstrates reliable detection and inversion of ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases in LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes key barriers to backdoor analysis in LLMs and provides a practical path for detecting and inverting backdoor triggers in discrete-token settings, even without reliable blacklists.

Abstract: While effective backdoor detection and inversion schemes have been developed
for AIs used e.g. for images, there are challenges in "porting" these methods
to LLMs. First, the LLM input space is discrete, which precludes gradient-based
search over this space, central to many backdoor inversion methods. Second,
there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative
trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong
marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,
as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not
exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three
key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,
starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved
by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a
candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target
class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,
and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we
demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts
ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.
