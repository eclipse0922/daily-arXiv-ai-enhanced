In most cases,\nrobustness can be ensured with floating-point arithmetic, and degenerate cases\ncan be resolved with a standard symbolic perturbation technique called\nSimulation of Simplicity. However, this becomes much more complex for\ntopological data structures of multifields, such as Jacobi sets and Reeb\nspaces. The geometric predicates used in their computation require exact\narithmetic and a more involved treatment of degenerate cases to ensure\ncorrectness.

The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns\nto bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world\ncollected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The\nmodel is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand\ninteraction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing\nsystem-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each\njoint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net\neffects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that\ngathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.\nOur complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy\nsuccessfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),\nhigh aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse\nwrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and\na teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our approach.
