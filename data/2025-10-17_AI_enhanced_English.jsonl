Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python\nlibrary that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and\nscikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.\ncubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data\nreside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a\nbroad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU\nacceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to\nsegmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both\nby benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution\nand segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining\nalgorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for\nscalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader\nPython scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,\nenabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis\nworkflows. cubic is openly available at\nhttps://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic", "AI": {"tldr": "cubic is an open-source Python library that GPU-accelerates common bioimage analysis tasks by augmenting SciPy/scikit-image with CuPy/cuCIM, enabling scalable 2D/3D processing and seamless CPU/GPU execution while preserving algorithmic fidelity.", "motivation": "As 2D/3D bioimage datasets grow, existing tools struggle with scalability, GPU acceleration, APIs, and 3D capabilities.
