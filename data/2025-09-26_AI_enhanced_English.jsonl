While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards\ninformation and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability\nSmoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's\nprobabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance\nratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient\nsignal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region\nthat discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.\n  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and\nQwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset\ngeneralisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO\n(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar\nperformance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise\nresponses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO\nsubstantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost\nof over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).", "AI": {"tldr": "PSPO introduces probability smoothing to replace ratio clipping in GRPO for LLM RLHF fine-tuning.

However, in practice, models often\nget updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,\ninvalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will\nnot lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses\nthis issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is\nresilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization\nproblem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),\nmost of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the\noptimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first\nprovably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized\nlinear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm.\nHowever, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high\nprice. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes\ndefined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a\nnew algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for\ngeneralized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,\nwe demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of\nrecourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also\nexhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its\nvalidity.

Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,\nportions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model\nparameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin\nmaximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for\ngeneralization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical\ndemonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and\nlacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary\nperspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent\nweaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify\nconditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without\nincorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many\nalternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,\nrendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable.
