Currently, mainstream image-based\npest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine\nlearning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have\nlimitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with\ntrajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting\nin water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest\ncounting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the\ndistribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded\nindividuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the\nimpact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and\nselected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed\nsix representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,\nspiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And\nby comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of\ndifferent stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we\ndetermined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting\nconfidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed\nstirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive\nframes as feedback to adjust the stirring speed.

The effectiveness of deep learning\nmethods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences\nmodel performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies\noften construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple\nthree-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real\ngeological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly\navailable three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress\nin deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present\nOpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset\nthat encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.\nOpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple\nconfigurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures\nsuch as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their\ncorresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward\nmodeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed\na deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling\nefficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This\ncapability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.\nOpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM\nexploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in\nelectromagnetic methods.

Although existing methods\ndemonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their\neffect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains\nlargely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on\nlong-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in\nmodern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more\ncomputation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\npruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with\nperformance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when\nperformance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.\nFurthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to\nrecover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,\nwe identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and\nhighlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to\nreasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning\nstrategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the\nrobustness of reasoning.
