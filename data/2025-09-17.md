*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-in-the-loop ML (U-Mamba) generalizes 3D anatomical segmentation for breast MRI, achieving high DSC and enabling improved preoperative planning and patient education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust generalization across variable imaging datasets and acquisition protocols; traditional models struggle to generalize; human-in-the-loop refinement can improve segmentations and 3D reconstructions across diverse datasets.

Method: 120 retrospective breast MRIs (T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences) processed in three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation; co-registration and segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; 3D visualization using ITK-SNAP; human-in-the-loop refinement with U-Mamba across imaging scenarios; evaluation via Dice similarity coefficient; clinician and patient interviews to assess clinical relevance.

Result: Dice similarity coefficients: whole organs 0.97 ± 0.013; fibroglandular tissue 0.96 ± 0.024; tumors 0.82 ± 0.12. Generated accurate 3D reconstructions; improved clinical planning, intraoperative navigation, decision support; enhanced patient education and communication; approach generalizes across patient datasets.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates generalization of 3D reconstruction and anatomical segmentation across diverse patient datasets, improving clinical workflows and patient engagement, with potential applicability to broader medical imaging tasks beyond breast cancer.

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based automatic segmentation of TRISO cross-sections; introduces RU-Net; dataset >2000 images; RU-Net achieves highest IoU vs U-Net, ResNet, Attention U-Net; reduces manual labor and improves objectivity in analyzing irradiation-induced morphology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce subjectivity and labor in post-irradiation microscopy analysis of TRISO particles; scale data analysis across thousands of particles.

Method: Create a labeled dataset of >2,000 cross-sectional TRISO images; train and compare CNN architectures (RU-Net, U-Net, ResNet, Attention U-Net) for segmentation of TRISO layers; evaluate using Intersection over Union (IoU).

Result: RU-Net yields best IoU among tested models; CNN-based segmentation accelerates analysis and reduces manual labor while improving objectivity.

Conclusion: CNN-based segmentation, especially RU-Net, is effective for automating TRISO layer segmentation and can significantly improve throughput and consistency in post-irradiation microscopy analysis.

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

### [3] [Modular, On-Site Solutions with Lightweight Anomaly Detection for Sustainable Nutrient Management in Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12247)
*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tiered, edge-friendly pipeline for anomaly detection and nutrient-status estimation in crops using an autoencoder for anomaly detection and two estimation modules (VI features with RF and end-to-end ViT); demonstrates efficient early anomaly detection and favorable but trade-off-heavy accuracy-energy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time nutrient management is essential for sustainable cropping but current analyses are slow and imaging-based methods can be computationally taxing. There is a need for flexible, energy-aware pipelines capable of edge deployment that balance speed, accuracy, and resource use.

Method: Develop a hierarchical pipeline: (1) autoencoder-based anomaly detection for early warning; (2) two status estimation modules of varying complexity—VI features with Random Forest and raw-image Vision Transformer; (3) energy analysis across methods; (4) evaluation using a nutrient-depletion experiment with three fertilizer levels (T1-100%, T2-50%, T3-25%) and multispectral imaging; (5) metrics include detection performance and R-squared for nutrient estimation (P, Ca).

Result: High-efficiency anomaly detection with 73% net detection of T3 samples nine days after transplanting; ViT-based status estimation outperforms RF on phosphorus and calcium (R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35) but at a higher energy cost.

Conclusion: The modular pipeline enables edge diagnostics and supports sustainable agricultural management by balancing speed, accuracy, and energy consumption; provides actionable options depending on resource constraints.

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor provides a dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics to probe multimodal humor understanding and narrative sequencing in large multimodal models, revealing notable gaps relative to humans; top models score ~61% on panel sequencing, highlighting integration challenges of visual and textual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humor understanding and social intelligence require robust multimodal reasoning; current LMMs struggle to integrate visual-textual information for coherent narrative and humor, necessitating a rigorous benchmark to drive improvements.

Method: Construct PixelHumor dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics; define tasks such as panel sequencing and humor interpretation; evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on these tasks; analyze gaps, compare to human performance.

Result: Leading LMMs achieve about 61% accuracy on panel sequencing (far below human performance), indicating substantial limitations in multimodal narrative understanding; the dataset provides a framework for evaluating and diagnosing multimodal contextual reasoning for humor.

Conclusion: PixelHumor serves as a rigorous benchmark to push development of LMMs toward better multimodal humor comprehension and narrative reasoning, enabling more natural and socially aware interactions.

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OnlineHOI framework for online HOI generation and perception using a memory-based approach built on Mamba, addressing the online vs offline gap; reports state-of-the-art results on Core4D, OAKINK2, and online HOI4D perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline HOI methods leverage entire interaction sequences, which is unrealistic for online settings where only current and historical data up to now are available. This motivates new online tasks and a streaming-capable model.

Method: Introduce OnlineHOI, a Mamba-based network with a memory mechanism that ingests streaming data and fuses current input with historical memory to perform online HOI generation and perception.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks and the online HOI4D perception task.

Conclusion: A memory-augmented, streaming-capable approach is effective for online HOI tasks and reveals the need to evaluate HOI systems in online scenarios to reflect real-world deployment.

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the dual-use nature of deep learning, highlighting deepfake technology as a rising risk that can threaten privacy, reputations, national security, and democratic processes, while underscoring the need for awareness, safeguards, and detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To raise awareness about the societal and security implications of deepfakes and to motivate development of safeguards.

Method: A conceptual overview that analyzes potential impacts of deepfake technologies; no empirical experiments or specific mitigation strategies are presented.

Result: No empirical results are provided; the focus is on outlining possible harms and the breadth of deepfake applications and risks.

Conclusion: Deepfake technology presents significant societal risks affecting privacy, reputation, security, and democratic processes; there is a need for safeguards, policy considerations, and further research into detection and mitigation.

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A frequency-aware measure of simplicity bias (SB) for CLIP models is proposed and validated. The study analyzes SB limitations in measuring complexity for large models, shows SB's relation to task performance across zero-shot and fine-tuning, with SB correlating more with out-of-distribution generalization than adversarial robustness; highlights the benefit of aligning inductive biases with target tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SB/complexity measures are ill-suited for large models and may not capture fine-grained bias differences. Understanding SB in CLIP and its impact across diverse image classification tasks is crucial for improving generalization and task-aligned inductive biases.

Method: The authors first critique existing complexity measures for small models and propose a frequency-aware SB measure that captures finer-grained SB differences. They validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to SB-modulation methods, comparing it to prior measures. They then study the relationship between SB and performance across zero-shot and fine-tuning settings on a suite of image classification tasks, including OOD generalization and adversarial robustness.

Result: The frequency-aware SB measure is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Empirical results show a spectrum of behaviors: stronger SB can improve OOD generalization more than adversarial robustness. The findings support the idea that matching a model's inductive biases to task characteristics yields performance benefits across tasks.

Conclusion: A refined, frequency-aware measure of SB provides a better tool for diagnosing and leveraging inductive biases in large vision-language models like CLIP. The work underscores that SB can have task-dependent benefits and trade-offs, guiding practitioners to align SB with target-task characteristics (e.g., favoring OOD generalization).

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

### [8] [GraphDerm: Fusing Imaging, Physical Scale, and Metadata in a Population-Graph Classifier for Dermoscopic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12277)
*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm fuses dermoscopic images with physical scale calibration and patient metadata in a population-graph to improve multiclass dermoscopic classification, leveraging a spectral GNN to outperform image-only baselines on ISIC-2019; scalable with sparse graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-only dermoscopy AI ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for geometric analysis, which can limit triage performance and calibration.

Method: Assemble ISIC 2018/2019 data; synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact lesion masks; train SE-ResNet-18 U-Nets for lesion and ruler segmentation; regress pixels-per-millimeter from ruler masks via a 1D-CNN; compute real-scale lesion descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of gyration); construct graph with node features from EfficientNet-B3 and edges encoding metadata/geometry similarity (dense or thresholded); apply a spectral GNN for semi-supervised node classification; compare against an image-only ANN baseline.

Result: Ruler and lesion segmentation Dice scores ~0.904 and 0.908; scale MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6); graph AUC 0.9812; thresholded-edge variant with ~25% edges yields AUC 0.9788 (vs 0.9440 for image-only); per-class AUCs largely 0.97–0.99.

Conclusion: Integrating calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata via a population graph substantially improves dermoscopic classification over image-only approaches on ISIC-2019, with sparse graphs maintaining near-optimal accuracy; promotes scale-aware, graph-based AI for decision support.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PATIMT, a position-aware TIMT task with region-specific translation and grounding, plus PATIMTBench benchmark (10 scenarios) and an Adaptive OCR Refinement Pipeline; after fine-tuning compact LVLMs, achieves state-of-the-art on both sub-tasks, showing scalability and generalizability of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIMT focuses on translating all text in an image but ignores bounding boxes and layout preservation, limiting practical applicability. There is a need for fine-grained, layout-preserving translation and fair, diverse evaluation across real-world scenes.

Method: Propose PATIMT with two sub-tasks: region-specific translation with bounding boxes and full-image translation with grounding. Build PATIMTBench with 10 diverse real-world scenarios. Develop an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline that selects OCR tools based on scenario characteristics to refine text extraction. Create a 1,200-instance high-quality test set annotated by humans. Fine-tune compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on the data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both sub-tasks.

Result: Fine-tuned compact LVLMs achieve state-of-the-art results on both region-specific translation and full-image translation with grounding. The experimental results demonstrate the scalability and generalizability of the proposed training data across scenarios.

Conclusion: PATIMT and PATIMTBench provide a practical, scalable framework for text-image translation that preserves layout and grounding information. The Adaptive OCR Refinement Pipeline enhances robustness across diverse scenarios, and the success of compact LVLMs suggests strong generalization with relatively small models in real-world TIMT applications.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

### [10] [Domain Adaptive SAR Wake Detection: Leveraging Similarity Filtering and Memory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12279)
*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimMemDA: unsupervised cross-modal domain adaptation for ship wake detection using optical-to-SAR style transfer, instance-level similarity filtering, a memory bank with KNN confidence-weighted fusion, and region-mixed training to improve cross-modal accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant domain gap between optical and SAR wake imagery; wake features are abstract in SAR, making annotation hard and models trained on optical degrade on SAR. Unsupervised cross-modal adaptation is needed to transfer detection capability across modalities.

Method: 1) WakeGAN-based style transfer to generate SAR-like images from optical data. 2) Instance-level feature similarity filtering to select source samples with target-like distributions, reducing negative transfer. 3) Feature-Confidence Memory Bank with KNN-based confidence-weighted pseudo-label fusion to calibrate target pseudo-labels during training. 4) Region-mixed training that combines source annotations with calibrated target pseudo-labels for better generalization.

Result: Experiments show improved accuracy and robustness in cross-modal ship wake detection, validating effectiveness and feasibility of SimMemDA.

Conclusion: SimMemDA offers an effective framework for unsupervised cross-modal wake detection by integrating style transfer, similarity filtering, memory-guided pseudo-labeling, and region-mixed training, potentially extendable to other cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

### [11] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-guided, data-driven deep learning pipeline (Amplifier Air-Transformer) produces hourly 2 km surface-to-air temperature maps for CONUS by reconstructing cloud-obscured GOES-16 data, amplifying ERA5 temps, and mapping to air temp with latent Earth surface properties; uncertainty quantified via deep ensembles; validated against stations with ~1.93°C error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need seamless, high-resolution, spatiotemporal near-surface air temperature coverage; existing data sources (weather stations, satellites) are incomplete; cloud masking and resolution gaps hinder single-source accuracy; propose an integrated approach combining satellite data reconstruction, physics-informed neural networks, and uncertainty quantification.

Method: Two-stage neural network: (1) reconstruct cloud-obscured GOES-16 surface temperature using annual cycle encoding, a linear term to upscale ERA5 temps, and conv layers for spatiotemporal patterns; (2) map reconstructed surface temp to air temperature using latent Earth surface properties; employ deep ensemble learning for predictive uncertainty; trained on 77.7B surface temp pixels and 155M station records (2018-2024).

Result: Hourly air temperature maps at 2 km over CONUS with 1.93°C accuracy on station-based validation; data generated and available online; scalable to other satellite sources.

Conclusion: Introduces a streamlined, extendable framework for high-resolution, continuous air temperature monitoring and anticipation of broader satellite integration; useful for weather/climate analyses and operational deployment.

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Motivation: To evaluate how post-hoc metric learning interacts with backbone domain specificity in a fine-grained, limited-data re-ID setting, and to compare general-purpose versus domain-specific pre-training.

Method: Compare backbones: DINOv2 (general-purpose) vs MegaDescriptor (domain-specific); use K-Nearest Neighbor with robust thresholding for identification, with and without a triplet-learning projection head; evaluate on averaged BAKS and BAUS; include qualitative visualizations.

Result: Triplet head improved MegaDescriptor by 0.13 points; it yielded only 0.03-point gains for DINOv2 on averaged BAKS and BAUS; general-purpose manifold is harder to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as shown by stagnant validation loss and qualitative visualizations.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pre-training is crucial for effective re-ID in specialized, limited-data tasks; post-hoc metric learning has limited and backbone-dependent benefits. The work provides practical guidance and publishes code at github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

### [13] [GhostNetV3-Small: A Tailored Architecture and Comparative Study of Distillation Strategies for Tiny Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12380)
*Florian Zager,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Architectural adaptation (GhostNetV3-Small) beats distillation for low‑resolution CIFAR‑10; distillation methods underperform vs baseline; design gains matter more for small-scale, edge‑friendly models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient inference on resource-constrained edge devices by reducing computation and adapting models for low-resolution inputs; assess whether distillation or architectural changes yield better performance.

Method: Develop GhostNetV3-Small tailored for low-resolution inputs (CIFAR-10). Compare various knowledge distillation techniques (traditional KD, teacher assistants, teacher ensembles) against baseline training on CIFAR-10.

Result: GhostNetV3-Small achieves 93.94% accuracy on CIFAR-10, significantly outperforming GhostNetV3. All distillation strategies reduced accuracy compared to baseline training.

Conclusion: Architectural adaptation can be more impactful than distillation for small-scale, low-resolution image classification; further research is needed on advanced distillation techniques suitable for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

*Rongkun Zhu,Kangning Cui,Wei Tang,Rui-Feng Wang,Sarra Alqahtani,David Lutz,Fan Yang,Paul Fine,Jordan Karubian,Robert Plemmons,Jean-Michel Morel,Victor Pauca,Miles Silman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Raw UAV imagery outperform orthomosaic imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in deployment-relevant tropical forest scenarios; orthomosaics aid cross-domain generalization; crown-center annotations enhance localization beyond simple bbox centroids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate mapping of individual trees is crucial for ecological monitoring and forest management, and current orthomosaic-based workflows suffer from stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing, hindering field deployment.

Method: Evaluate state-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models on both raw UAV imagery and orthomosaic imagery, assess within-domain and cross-domain transfer, and train with crown-center annotations to improve localization beyond bounding-box centroids.

Result: Raw imagery yields superior performance in deployment-relevant scenarios; orthomosaics provide robust cross-domain generalization; crown-center annotations further improve localization accuracy and provide precise tree positions for downstream analyses.

Conclusion: For UAV-based biodiversity monitoring, prioritize raw imagery for deployment, leverage orthomosaics for cross-domain robustness, and incorporate crown-center annotations to enhance precise tree localization for ecological analyses.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

*Mayank Patel,Rahul Jain,Asim Unmesh,Karthik Ramani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New benchmark MechBench of 693 synthetic gear assemblies with per-part ground-truth motion; paired with DYNAMO, a dependency-aware model predicting per-part SE(3) motions from segmented CAD point clouds, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding geometrically induced, coupled motion in mechanical assemblies (gears) from static geometry; existing work often relies on predefined joints or labeled motion and lacks datasets to study transmission-driven dynamics.

Method: MechBench provides 693 synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories induced by contact and transmission, not predefined joints. DYNAMO is a dependency-aware neural model that predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point clouds, capturing the geometric coupling between parts.

Result: DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, delivering accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear configurations.

Conclusion: MechBench and DYNAMO offer a novel, data-driven framework to study and learn coupled mechanical motion in CAD assemblies, enabling systematic exploration of geometry-driven motion without predefined joints.

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cott-ADNet is a lightweight real-time detector for cotton bolls/flowers, built on YOLOv11n, with NeLU-enhanced Global Attention and a Dilated Receptive Field SPP, achieving high precision/recall with low FLOPs on a new cotton dataset, enabling automated harvesting and phenotypic analysis; code and dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harvesting is labor-intensive with missed harvest windows causing yield losses; accurate recognition of cotton bolls and their maturity is essential for automation, yield estimation, and breeding.

Method: Extend YOLOv11n with two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to capture weak/low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field SPP to expand receptive fields for multi-scale context at low computational cost. Train on a labeled dataset of 4,966 images with an external validation set of 1,216 field images; achieve 7.5 GFLOPs.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet provides an accurate and efficient solution for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis; code and dataset released to support future research.

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

*Zhenxin Zhang,Zhihua Xu,Yuwei Cao,Ningli Xu,Shuye Wang,Shen'ao Cui,Zhen Li,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A meta-review of deep learning-based point-cloud processing that covers tasks like scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and modeling, emphasizing practical deployment in urban/environmental contexts and identifying gaps between current algorithms and real-world use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid deep-learning advances, surveys focus on network architectures for unordered point clouds and overlook practical deployment factors such as large data volume, varying density, diverse scenes, and multiple modalities. This work aims to connect research to real-world applications.

Method: Systematic meta-review of deep learning approaches and datasets across core point-cloud tasks (scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, modeling) with emphasis on urban/environmental applications. The paper maps methods to practical needs and identifies gaps for deployment, offering algorithmic and practical insights.

Result: Provides a consolidated view of current methods and datasets, highlighting gaps between research and application, such as scalability, generalization to diverse densities, multi-modality handling, and dataset biases. It frames the state-of-the-art in the context of real-world tasks and outlines actionable directions.

Conclusion: Advocates closing the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, calling for scalable, robust, and multimodal point-cloud solutions; emphasizes need for standard benchmarks and guidelines to translate research into practice.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

### [18] [Two-Stage Decoupling Framework for Variable-Length Glaucoma Prognosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12453)
*Yiran Song,Yikai Zhang,Silvia Orengo-Nania,Nian Wang,Fenglong Ma,Rui Zhang,Yifan Peng,Mingquan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage framework decouples feature learning from temporal aggregation to handle variable-length glaucoma prognosis data, using self-supervised pretraining across datasets and an attention-based sequence model, achieving robust, compact performance on OHTS and GRAPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glaucoma prognosis needs to utilize sequential data of varying lengths and heterogeneous datasets. Fixed-length inputs and end-to-end models limit flexibility and data efficiency, especially with small glaucoma datasets. A decoupled approach using cross-dataset self-supervised feature learning and an attention-based temporal aggregator can improve performance and efficiency.

Method: Stage 1: Feature representation module trained with self-supervised learning to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets while ignoring supervisory differences, enabling cross-dataset feature learning. Stage 2: Temporal aggregation module with attention-based mechanism to process varying-length sequences, enabling flexible and efficient use of all data while keeping model size compact.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks, OHTS and GRAPE, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TSDF across datasets that differ in scale and clinical settings.

Conclusion: The Two-Stage Decoupling Framework provides flexible, data-efficient glaucoma prognosis for variable-length inputs, achieving robust performance with a compact model by separating feature learning from temporal aggregation and leveraging self-supervised and attention-based techniques.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

### [19] [Image Tokenizer Needs Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12474)
*Kai Qiu,Xiang Li,Hao Chen,Jason Kuen,Xiaohao Xu,Jiuxiang Gu,Yinyi Luo,Bhiksha Raj,Zhe Lin,Marios Savvides*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage tokenizer training (main training with latent perturbations and post-training of the decoder) to align discrete latent spaces with generation-time distributions, introducing pFID as a correlation metric, and demonstrates notable generation-quality gains (gFID) across tokenizers and generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a mismatch between reconstruction distribution learned by tokenizers and the generation distribution encountered during sampling in image generation models using discrete latent spaces. Tokenizers trained only on reconstruction ignore sampling-time errors, causing a gap that degrades generation quality and convergence.

Method: Main training uses a latent perturbation strategy to simulate sampling noise; introduces a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme with pFID as an evaluation metric, improving robustness and convergence. Post-training optimizes the tokenizer decoder given a well-trained generator to further reduce distribution differences between generated and reconstructed tokens. Validation across discrete and continuous tokenizers and autoregressive/diffusion-based generators.

Result: Main training yields a significant improvement (gFID ≈ 1.60) and the post-training further improves to ≈1.36 gFID with a generator of ~400M parameters. The approach enhances robustness, boosts generation quality and convergence speed, and shows broad applicability across tokenizers and generator types.

Conclusion: A two-stage tokenizer training pipeline effectively mitigates the distribution mismatch between generation and reconstruction in discrete latent spaces, improving generation quality and speed, with a practical pFID metric and broad applicability to different tokenizers and generative models.

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

*Tianshu Huang,Akarsh Prabhakara,Chuhan Chen,Jay Karhade,Deva Ramanan,Matthew O'Toole,Anthony Rowe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT), a foundational model for 4D mmWave radar trained on the largest raw radar dataset (1M samples), enabling 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation from single-chip sensors; demonstrates data-efficient scaling, strong generalization, and raw-data superiority over lossy representations; estimates need for ~100M samples to fully exploit potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of standardized foundation models and large-scale datasets for mmWave radar, and the limited angular resolution of inexpensive single-chip radars; aim to enable high-level perception tasks from 4D radar via learning on large-scale data.

Method: Assemble a large raw radar dataset (1M samples, 29 hours); train Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT) to predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation; perform ablations on data representations; evaluate cross-setting generalization and fine-tuning; analyze data scaling (approximately 20% improvement per 10x data).

Result: GRT generalizes across diverse settings; can be fine-tuned for different tasks; raw radar data outperforms lossy representations by the equivalent of 10x more data; logarithmic data scaling with ~20% per 10x data; rough estimate that ~100M samples (~3000 hours) are required to fully exploit potential.

Conclusion: Foundational mmWave radar models are feasible; raw data representations are valuable; calls for larger datasets and model development to unlock full capabilities of 4D single-chip radar; potential to approach higher-resolution sensors with less costly hardware.

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

TL;DR: A framework to evaluate Vision-Language Models under controlled noise, revealing that caption descriptiveness, model size, and specific perturbations influence robustness, and establishing a standardized benchmark for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess robustness of Vision-Language Models under real-world perturbations and provide a standardized benchmark to compare noise resilience across model sizes and datasets.

Method: Evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations (lighting variation, motion blur, compression artifacts). Use lexical metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based sentence-embedding similarity to quantify semantic alignment across diverse datasets.

Result: Findings indicate: (1) ground-truth caption descriptiveness significantly affects performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; (3) noise types such as JPEG compression and motion blur substantially degrade performance across models; underscores trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience; provides a standardized benchmark for robust multimodal learning.

Conclusion: Proposes a standardized benchmark for robust multimodal learning and informs future model design by clarifying how model size, data characteristics, and perturbations impact performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

*Ali Torabi,Sanjog Gaihre,MD Mahbubur Rahman,Yaqoob Majeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IG-CAM introduces instance-guided refinement, influence-function integration, and multi-scale boundary enhancement to produce boundary-aware, complete object localization in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). It achieves state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 (mIoU 82.3% pre-CRF, 86.6% post-CRF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) often yields localization to only discriminative parts and struggles with object boundaries. This work seeks complete object coverage and sharp boundaries by leveraging instance-level cues and training-sample influence.

Method: Three components: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement uses ground-truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation for full object coverage; (2) Influence Function Integration models relationships between training samples and predictions to improve robustness; (3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement applies progressive refinement to sharpen boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art PASCAL VOC 2012 mIoU of 82.3% before post-processing and 86.6% after CRF refinement. Demonstrates superior localization with complete coverage, precise boundaries, and good computational efficiency. Extensive ablations and qualitative evaluations on 600 images support robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: IG-CAM establishes a new benchmark for WSSS, offering a practical solution when pixel-level annotations are unavailable or expensive, with boundary-aware, complete object localization.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end framework that refines noisy/incomplete point clouds into artist-style meshes by recasting 3D refinement as 2D inpainting, yielding promising ShapeNet results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artist-style meshes are essential for animation and texturing in graphics pipelines, but real-world sensing produces noisy, incomplete data and existing methods rely on clean inputs or multi-stage pipelines.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline that refines the input point cloud and directly outputs artist-style meshes; reformulates 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting problem to leverage powerful generative models.

Result: Preliminary experiments on ShapeNet indicate the approach can produce clean, complete meshes and demonstrate the potential of an end-to-end refinement-to-mesh framework.

Conclusion: The framework shows feasibility for generating artist-style meshes from imperfect data in an end-to-end manner; future work should validate on more datasets and optimize the 2D inpainting-based refinement.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

*Benjamin Vail,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Ajay Sharda,Sidharth Rai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-aware RGB-D CV pipeline to estimate stalk diameter robustly for high-throughput phenotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, accurate, high-throughput measurement of stalk diameter to improve breeding for mechanical stability, biomass, and disease resistance; traditional methods are labor-intensive and not scalable.

Method: Integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via PCA to estimate diameter; robust to curvature, occlusion, and image noise.

Result: Claims robust, scalable diameter estimation suitable for high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and agronomic research.

Conclusion: Proposes a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline that yields accurate stalk diameter measurements from RGB-D data, reducing manual labor and enabling scalable phenotyping.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

### [25] [Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12544)
*Can Peng,Yuyuan Liu,Yingyu Yang,Pramit Saha,Qianye Yang,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A federated learning approach for multi-label data that leverages Neural Collapse (NC) to align feature distributions across clients via a feature disentanglement module and NC-guided clustering, with regularization to promote compact latent clusters; shows superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning with non-IID, especially multi-label data, suffers from degraded performance due to label co-occurrence, inter-label dependencies, and local-global label distribution discrepancies. Neural Collapse offers a geometric structure for separable class representations, which can be leveraged to improve cross-client alignment. Adapting NC to multi-label settings requires disentangling features corresponding to different semantic concepts.

Method: Propose a feature disentanglement module to extract semantically specific features for multi-label data. Align feature distributions across clients and enforce a predefined shared NC structure to guide clustering of disentangled class-wise features. Use regularization losses to promote compact clustering in the latent space, mitigating conflicts from heterogeneous local data. The NC-guided clustering is designed to operate in FL with skewed label distributions where image-level features may contain multiple concepts.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings show that the proposed method outperforms existing FL methods for multi-label data, validating its effectiveness

Conclusion: The proposed NC-guided multi-label FL approach successfully translates Neural Collapse to a multi-label FL setting, enabling better cross-client feature alignment and more compact, well-clustered representations, thereby improving performance under heterogeneous data distributions and complex label interactions.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

*Yingxin Lai,Zitong Yu,Jun Wang,Linlin Shen,Yong Xu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simulation-driven, multi-agent framework using LLM-powered forgery agents to produce nuanced, text-image-consistent samples for face forgery detectors, guided by Adaptive Rejection Sampling, yielding improved cross-architecture detector performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy in face forgery detection, due to ecological invalidity of training data. The study aims to capture diverse forgery intents and realistic social-media text-image interactions to close this gap.

Method: Develops a multi-agent system with LLM-powered agents that have profiles and memory; agents simulate forgery creation and interact in a simulated social environment; samples are labeled with nuanced text-image consistency rather than simple binaries; Adaptive Rejection Sampling ensures data quality and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments show the simulated data improves detectors across multiple architectures, validating the approach.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven data generation is valuable for closing the realism gap in face forgery detection and can generalize to detectors and future tasks; demonstrates effectiveness of the framework.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

### [27] [Explicit Multimodal Graph Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12554)
*Wenxuan Ji,Haichao Shi,Xiao-Yu zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGNM introduces a multimodal graph network with a four-stage HOI-specific graph and cross-level vision-language interactions to boost HOI detection, achieving state-of-the-art on HICO-DET and V-COCO and improving rare/non-rare class balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Transformer-based HOI detectors are strong, they do not explicitly model the relational structure among humans and objects. Graph Neural Networks naturally capture such relations, and incorporating multimodal (vision-language) cues can further improve information propagation and recognition across human–object pairs.

Method: Proposes a four-stage multimodal graph network for HOI detection with a dedicated four-stage graph structure and a multi-level feature interaction mechanism that fuses vision and language features to propagate information among human–object pairs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard HOI benchmarks (HICO-DET and V-COCO). When paired with a stronger object detector, it yields substantial gains and maintains a favorable balance between rare and non-rare interaction classes.

Conclusion: Explicit relational modeling via a multimodal graph network is effective for HOI detection, and the proposed MGNM framework demonstrates the benefits of structured graph reasoning and vision–language fusion for improved performance and robustness.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

### [28] [VQT-Light:Lightweight HDR Illumination Map Prediction with Richer Texture.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12556)
*Kunliang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VQVAE+ViT-based framework (VQT-Light) for lighting estimation that uses discrete illumination features and global context to predict textured light maps as multiclass classification, achieving 40 FPS and superior metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lighting estimation with rich texture while maintaining speed and memory efficiency; existing methods either underrepresent texture or are too slow or texture-poor.

Method: Two-module approach: (1) VQVAE-based discrete feature extraction of illumination maps to avoid posterior collapse; (2) ViT-based global context modeling to predict illumination outside the field of view; framing lighting estimation as a multiclass classification task for efficiency and texture fidelity.

Result: Produces light maps with richer texture and higher fidelity; achieves 40 FPS inference; quantitative and qualitative experiments show superiority over current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VQT-Light offers a fast, texture-rich lighting estimation solution leveraging discrete latent features and global context, outperforming existing methods in speed and texture fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [29] [Adaptive Sampling Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12569)
*Qi Wang,Shuliang Zhu,Jinjia Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive sampling scheduler for consistency distillation enhances diffusion model sampling by dynamically selecting target timesteps, optimizing forward/backward steps, and applying smoothing/clipping for stability at high guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distillation methods rely on fixed deterministic or stochastic timestep strategies, which constrain flexibility and efficiency. A flexible scheduler across frameworks is needed to unlock the full sampling potential of diffusion models.

Method: Three strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection based on computed timestep importance; (ii) optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition using timestep importance; (iii) smoothing clipping and color balancing to stabilize high-guidance-scale generation.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in generative performance across multiple consistency distillation methods, demonstrating strong adaptability and practical gains.

Conclusion: The adaptive sampling scheduler offers a flexible, effective approach that broadens the applicability of consistency distillation in complex generation scenarios.

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

### [30] [DisorientLiDAR: Physical Attacks on LiDAR-based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12595)
*Yizhen Lao,Yu Zhang,Ziting Wang,Chengbo Wang,Yifei Xue,Wanpeng Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework named DisorientLiDAR that attacks LiDAR-based localization by identifying and removing top-keypoint regions in point clouds, significantly degrading registration accuracy; demonstrated across multiple models and KITTI, with validation on Autoware and extended to a physical-world scenario using near-infrared absorptive materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based localization is critical for autonomous driving, yet adversarial attacks on localization have been underexplored compared to perception attacks. Demonstrating vulnerability is essential for developing robust defenses.

Method: Reverse-engineer localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks) to locate critical keypoints (Top-K) and strategically remove them to disrupt point-cloud registration. Evaluate on three state-of-the-art registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) using KITTI, then validate on the Autoware autonomous driving platform. Extend the attack to the physical world by applying near-infrared absorptive materials to hide key regions.

Result: Removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades registration accuracy across the tested models. In Autoware, hiding only a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. The physical-world variant replicates the attack effects observed in KITTI data, indicating feasibility beyond simulation.

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR demonstrates a general and practical vulnerability of LiDAR-based localization to targeted keypoint removal, highlighting the need for defenses and robust localization strategies that can withstand such adversarial perturbations, including in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

### [31] [Exploring Spectral Characteristics for Single Image Reflection Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12627)
*Pengbo Guo,Chengxu Liu,Guoshuai Zhao,Xingsong Hou,Jialie Shen,Xueming Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spectral-codebook framework reconstructs the reflection spectrum and uses a Spectrum-Aware Transformer to separate reflection and transmission, achieving state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection removal is ill-posed due to overlapping reflection and transmission; existing image-domain approaches ignore spectral variations of reflected light, hindering accurate separation.

Method: Introduce Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the reflection spectrum; two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and to enhance spectral differences along the wavelength dimension; Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains.

Result: Experimental results on three benchmarks show superior performance and generalization over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Leveraging spectral information via a spectral codebook and Spectrum-Aware Transformer improves reflection removal and generalizes across datasets.

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

production process of maps have evolved substantially. The article categorizes

*Liming Lu,Shuchao Pang,Xu Zheng,Xiang Gu,Anan Du,Yunhuai Liu,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIARD introduces a cyclic, iterative ARD framework using multiple teachers and contrastive push-loss alignment, plus continuous adversarial retraining, to balance robustness and clean accuracy in lightweight student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual-teacher ARD methods suffer from conflicting objectives (clean vs robust teachers) and degradation of the robust teacher due to generated adversarial examples, leading to reduced clean accuracy and robustness.

Method: Propose Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) with (a) a multi-teacher framework that uses contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve objective conflicts, and (b) continuous adversarial retraining to sustain teacher robustness as adversarial examples evolve.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show average improvements of 3.53 in adversarial defense rates and 5.87 in clean accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing robustness and generalization; code available at the provided repo.

Conclusion: CIARD effectively balances robustness and generalization in ARD by combining multi-teacher alignment with ongoing adversarial training, offering a practical, state-of-the-art approach for robust model deployment.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

*Jinjie Shen,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Nan Pu,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SAMM, a semantically aligned multimodal manipulation dataset, and RamDG, a retrieval-augmented detection and grounding framework. They show improved detection performance on SAMM, addressing misalignment in prior benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal manipulation datasets suffer from artificial misalignment artifacts that do not reflect real-world attacks, which often preserve semantic consistency across modalities. There is a need for benchmarks and methods that capture semantically coordinated manipulations and reason with external context.

Method: SAMM is created in two stages: (1) apply state-of-the-art image manipulations; (2) generate contextually plausible textual narratives that reinforce the deception. RamDG retrieves external contextual evidence using knowledge bases, encodes this evidence alongside image/text inputs, and uses image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to locate and explain manipulations.

Result: RamDG substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06 percentage points higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The SAMM dataset and code are publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The work provides a realistic benchmark for semantically-coordinated multimodal manipulation and a retrieval-augmented framework that improves detection and grounding, contributing to more robust media forensics research.

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

*YiTong Liu,TianZhu Liu,YanFeng GU*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A frequency-aware, multi-scale attention framework (MFAF) for cross-view geo-localization, using a Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block to capture both low-frequency structure and high-frequency edges, plus a Frequency-aware Spatial Attention module to focus on informative regions and reduce noise across views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization is challenging due to severe appearance changes across viewpoints and difficulty in extracting discriminative features; existing feature map segmentation methods neglect spatial and semantic information, limiting robustness.

Method: MFAF comprises two components: (1) Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) that captures low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales; (2) Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) that adaptively emphasizes key regions in the frequency feature maps to mitigate background noise and viewpoint variability.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV show that MFAF achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks, demonstrating robustness across views.

Conclusion: Integrating multi-frequency analysis with spatial attention improves cross-view geo-localization by producing more robust, view-invariant features and focusing on informative regions; the approach is effective on standard drone datasets and could generalize to related cross-view recognition tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

*Gordon Hung,Ivan Felipe Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two marine datasets (Coral Disease and Fish Species) benchmark recent YOLO variants for AUVs. Accuracy saturates by YOLOv9, but speed improves; YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded deployment; establishes an open marine-vision benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imagery suffers from light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while AUVs have limited compute. There is a gap in understanding how successive YOLO releases perform in marine conditions.

Method: Create Coral Disease (4,480 images, 18 classes) and Fish Species (7,500 images, 20 classes) datasets. For each dataset, train four regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of images) using identical hyperparameters: 100 epochs, 640 px input, batch 16, T4 GPU. Evaluate on validation/test: precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, FPS. Use YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, YOLOv11-s. Apply post-hoc Grad-CAM for localization analysis.

Result: Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, indicating architectural innovations mainly improve efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed improves markedly with newer variants. YOLOv10 offers the best speed–accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment.

Conclusion: First controlled marine-specific comparison of recent YOLO variants. Provides an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research. Recommends YOLOv10 for best embedded deployment performance; YOLOv9 marks the accuracy ceiling among the tested versions.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

TL;DR: StereoCarla is a high-fidelity synthetic stereo dataset built on CARLA that improves generalization of stereo matching models across KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, and other benchmarks, including benefits in multi-dataset training; code and data are available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization of learning-based stereo methods is hampered by narrow training data diversity. A realistic, diverse, and controllable synthetic dataset tailored for autonomous driving could improve depth perception robustness.

Method: Construct StereoCarla on the CARLA simulator with wide-ranging camera configurations (baselines, viewpoints, sensor placements) and environmental factors (lighting, weather, road geometry). Conduct cross-domain evaluations on KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury, ETH3D, comparing against 11 existing stereo datasets, and assess impact in multi-dataset training.

Result: Models trained on StereoCarla outperform those trained on 11 existing datasets in generalization accuracy across multiple benchmarks. When included in multi-dataset training, StereoCarla yields substantial improvements in generalization performance.

Conclusion: StereoCarla offers a valuable benchmark that combines realism, diversity, and controllability to support robust stereo algorithms for autonomous driving; it is compatible with multi-dataset training and facilitates better depth perception; code and data are available.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under
realistic, diverse, and controllable settings, facilitating more robust depth
perception systems for autonomous vehicles. Code can be available at

### [38] [SmokeBench: A Real-World Dataset for Surveillance Image Desmoking in Early-Stage Fire Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12701)
*Wenzhuo Jin,Qianfeng Yang,Xianhao Wu,Hongming Chen,Pengpeng Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-world SmokeBench dataset: paired smoke-degraded and smoke-free surveillance images for supervised desmoking in early-stage fire scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early fire scenes (0–15 minutes after ignition) produce heavy smoke that severely reduces visibility, impairing surveillance and emergency response; there is a shortage of large, real-world paired datasets for desmoking.

Method: Collected real-world surveillance images across diverse scenes and smoke conditions, created precisely aligned degraded–clean pairs, benchmarked multiple desmoking methods, and released the dataset publicly.

Result: A curated, aligned paired dataset enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation for desmoking; extensive benchmarking results; public release at GitHub.

Conclusion: SmokeBench provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust, real-world image desmoking in fire scenes and supports evaluation and development.

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

*Siju Ma,Changsiyu Gong,Xiaofeng Fan,Yong Ma,Chengjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided infrared–visible image fusion framework RIS-FUSION unifies fusion and referring image segmentation (RIS) via joint optimization, introducing LangGatedFusion to inject text features, plus a new MM-RIS benchmark for multimodal RIS; achieves state-of-the-art results with >11% mIoU improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no goal-aligned supervision for text-driven fusion tasks. RIS and text-driven fusion share the objective of highlighting the object described by the text, suggesting that unifying them can improve semantic alignment and evaluation of text-guided fusion.

Method: A cascaded RIS-FUSION framework that jointly optimizes fusion and RIS. The LangGatedFusion module injects textual features into the fusion backbone to improve semantic alignment. A new MM-RIS dataset provides infrared-visible image pairs, segmentation masks, and referring expressions (12.5k training, 3.5k testing).

Result: RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU on RIS tasks while enabling text-guided fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively aligns text guidance with fusion outcomes and delivers a scalable benchmark for multimodal RIS, with code and dataset to be released to support further research.

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

*Haozhe Zhang,Chenchen Jing,Mingyu Liu,Qingsheng Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) uses a disentangle-and-reconstruct feature augmentation framework with a debiasing strategy to synthesize unseen attribute–object compositions from seen primitives, achieving state-of-the-art CZSL performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CZSL faces entangled attribute–object representations and long-tailed data; leveraging prior knowledge of seen attributes/objects and inspiration from neural processes (imagination vs perception) can improve generalization to unseen compositions.

Method: Proposes a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature augmentation coupled with a debiasing strategy. It explicitly leverages seen attributes and objects to synthesize high-fidelity composition features, guiding compositional generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used CZSL datasets show state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: DeFA effectively addresses entanglement and long-tail distribution in CZSL by synthesizing high-quality composition features from seen primitives, enabling strong generalization to unseen attribute–object combinations in diverse settings.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

*Heng Zhang,Haichuan Hu,Yaomin Shen,Weihao Yu,Yilei Yuan,Haochen You,Guo Cheng,Zijian Zhang,Lubin Gan,Huihui Wei,Hao Zhang,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AsyMoE is a three-expert-group MoE framework for large vision-language models that explicitly handles the asymmetry between spatial visual processing and sequential language processing, achieving large accuracy gains with fewer activated parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-based LVLMs struggle due to modality asymmetry: visual information is spatially complete while language requires retaining sequential context; deeper language experts tend to rely on pretrained parametric knowledge rather than grounding in the provided visual/linguistic evidence, hindering cross-modal interactions.

Method: Propose AsyMoE with three expert groups: intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing; hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions; and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and preserve contextual grounding.

Result: Experiments show 26.58% accuracy improvement over vanilla MoE and 15.45% over modality-specific MoE, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Conclusion: AsyMoE provides a principled, asymmetry-aware MoE architecture that enhances cross-modal grounding and efficiency in LVLMs, offering a strong step toward better fusion of vision and language while reducing parameter activation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

*Pukun Zhao,Longxiang Wang,Miaowei Wang,Chen Chen,Fanqing Zhou,Haojian Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two dynamic spatial benchmarks (locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination) assess long-horizon planning and memory under partial observability and changing environments; they introduce a subjective experience-based memory mechanism for cross-task transfer and validation, and show mainstream models struggle in dynamic spatial reasoning; code/data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial reasoning benchmarks are static or globally observable, failing to capture long-horizon reasoning, partial observability, memory, and adaptation under dynamic changes. A dynamic, locally observable setting is needed to evaluate and guide progress.

Method: Introduce two dynamic benchmarks where each action alters the environment; propose a subjective experience-based memory mechanism to enable cross-task experience transfer; conduct experiments to assess model performance and validate the benchmarks; provide code and data with a public link.

Result: Benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory. The paper also proposes a memory mechanism for transfer; code and data are released for replication.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmarks create a comprehensive platform to drive future methodological advances in dynamic spatial reasoning and memory, enabling systematic evaluation and transfer of experience across tasks.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

### [43] [SPGen: Spherical Projection as Consistent and Flexible Representation for Single Image 3D Shape Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12721)
*Jingdong Zhang,Weikai Chen,Yuan Liu,Jionghao Wang,Zhengming Yu,Zhuowen Shen,Bo Yang,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen introduces a single-view 3D generator that uses multi-layer 2D SP maps (spherical projections) to encode geometry in the image domain, yielding view-consistent, nested internal structures and efficient diffusion-based generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view 3D generative models using multiview diffusion priors suffer from view inconsistencies and struggle to model complex internal topology; a representation that ensures consistency and supports internal structure is needed.

Method: Project geometry onto a bounding sphere and unwrap it into multi-layer 2D SP representations; operate entirely in the image domain to leverage 2D diffusion priors; enable direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; SP maps can represent nested internal structures.

Result: SPGen significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and computational efficiency as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SPGen provides a consistent, flexible, and efficient framework for single-view 3D generation by encoding geometry with injective SP mappings and enabling direct diffusion-based generation in the image domain.

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

### [44] [Defense-to-Attack: Bypassing Weak Defenses Enables Stronger Jailbreaks in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12724)
*Yunhan Zhao,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defense2Attack: a jailbreak framework that exploits defensive patterns to craft more effective and efficient prompts for Vision-Language Models, combining visual perturbations, defense-styled prompts, and reinforcement-tuned red-team suffixes to bypass safety in a single attempt.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaks; existing attacks are often inefficient and require multiple attempts. An unexpected finding is that introducing weak defensive cues can inadvertently strengthen jailbreak effectiveness, highlighting a gap in current safety evaluations and defenses.

Method: Three components: (1) visual optimizer embedding universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative semantics; (2) textual optimizer refining input with a defense-styled prompt; (3) red-team suffix generator using reinforcement fine-tuning. All aimed at guiding jailbreaks to bypass safety guardrails in a single attempt. Empirical evaluation on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks.

Result: Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that typically require multiple tries across the tested benchmarks.

Conclusion: Introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to enhance attacks. Highlights a need for more robust defenses and evaluation methodologies to withstand defense-guided jailbreaks and suggests directions for strengthening VLM safety.

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveVerse is a prompt-based framework that simulates realistic RF signals from generated indoor scenes with human motion, enabling RF imaging data generation and performance gains in data-limited and data-adequate settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF sensing is privacy-preserving for indoor perception, but collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic, diverse environments is challenging; scalable synthetic data is needed.

Method: A language-guided 4D world generator with a state-aware causal transformer for human motion generation constrained by spatial and textual inputs, and a phase-coherent ray tracing RF simulator; two case studies on high-resolution RF imaging and activity recognition.

Result: Demonstrates conditioned motion generation; phase coherence improves beamforming and respiration monitoring; data generation for RF imaging; consistent performance gains in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Conclusion: WaveVerse enables RF imaging data generation for the first time and yields consistent performance gains, supporting data augmentation in RF sensing tasks.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

*Jiateng Liu,Hao Gao,Jiu-Cheng Xie,Chi-Man Pun,Jian Xiong,Haolun Li,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic Gaussian management framework for high-fidelity object reconstruction, introducing adaptive densification, gradient-aware SH order selection, and task-decoupled pruning to outperform state-of-the-art with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses gradient conflicts and inefficiencies in Gaussian Splatting caused by indiscriminate attribute assignment; aims to improve reconstruction quality and efficiency while reducing parameter count.

Method: 1) Densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics (SHs) or normals under surface reconstruction supervision; 2) Lightweight Gaussian representation with per-Gaussian adaptive SH order based on gradient magnitudes; 3) Task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussians with minimal impact; 4) Model-agnostic integration into other frameworks.

Result: Consistent improvements over state-of-the-art in reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian management approach is effective and generalizable, enabling higher-quality reconstructions with fewer parameters and can be integrated into other frameworks to boost performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

### [47] [Modelling and analysis of the 8 filters from the "master key filters hypothesis" for depthwise-separable deep networks in relation to idealized receptive fields based on scale-space theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12746)
*Tony Lindeberg,Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eight 'master key' filters from depthwise-separable ConvNeXt networks can be approximated by discrete scale-space filters; they are well modeled by separable, Gaussian-difference operators with near-half-pixel offsets, enabling replacement of learned filters with idealized versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure of learned filters in depthwise-separable CNNs and assess whether they can be captured by simple, principled models (discrete scale-space).

Method: Compute spatial spread (weighted mean/variance of abs(filter values)); test separability and offset ~0.5 grid; model as difference operators on a discrete Gaussian smoothing; two modeling variants (per-filter scale vs shared scale); fit by enforcing equal variances or minimizing L1/L2 distance between model and learned filters.

Result: Idealized models show good qualitative similarity to learned filters; experimental results indicate the networks can replace learned filters with idealized filters with preserved performance/predictive properties.

Conclusion: Depthwise-separable network filters can be effectively approximated by discrete scale-space filters, supporting a principled, separable, Gaussian-difference modeling approach and potential simplifications for network design.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

### [48] [What Makes a Good Generated Image? Investigating Human and Multimodal LLM Image Preference Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12750)
*Rishab Parthasarathy,Jasmine Collins,Cory Stephenson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans and multimodal LLMs differ in how they judge image quality attributes; LLMs show weaker inter-attribute correlations and struggle with anatomical accuracy, as shown by controlled synthetic datasets and attribute-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal LLMs use human-relevant concepts (style, composition, aesthetics) when judging image quality, and to compare these judgments to human judgments.

Method: 1) Curate a human preference dataset from synthetically generated image pairs across key attributes (aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, style). 2) Analyze inter-attribute correlations to see how attributes co-vary in human judgments. 3) Apply the same inter-attribute analysis to multimodal LLM judgments. 4) Generate synthetic datasets with precise control over each attribute to measure attribute-specific judgments.

Result: Humans can reliably judge across all attributes; inter-attribute correlations are strong in humans but much weaker in LLMs; some attributes (notably anatomical accuracy) are particularly hard for multimodal LLMs to learn, leading to divergent overall assessments between humans and models.

Conclusion: There are meaningful, systematic differences in attribute-based image quality judgments between humans and multimodal LLMs. The study highlights the need for attribute-focused evaluation and careful interpretation of LLM judgments in image quality tasks, suggesting room for improving model alignment with human notions of aesthetics, anatomy, and composition.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

### [49] [Recurrent Cross-View Object Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12757)
*Xiaohan Zhang,Si-Yuan Cao,Xiaokai Bai,Yiming Li,Zhangkai Shen,Zhe Wu,Xiaoxi Hu,Hui-liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCOT is a recurrent transformer for cross-view object geo-localization that uses query/prompt tokens, SAM priors, and a hierarchical RFEM to iteratively refine localization, achieving state-of-the-art results with 60% fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVOGL methods treat the task as one-shot detection, making them vulnerable to feature noise and lacking mechanisms for error correction. There is a need for iterative localization with task-specific intent and semantic guidance.

Method: ReCOT formulates CVOGL as a recurrent localization task. It uses learnable tokens that encode intent from the query image and point prompt, and iteratively attends to reference features to refine the location. It adds (1) SAM-based knowledge distillation to inject segmentation priors without extra inference cost and (2) a Reference Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM) with hierarchical attention to emphasize object-relevant regions.

Result: Experiments on standard CVOGL benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance and a 60% reduction in parameters compared to previous SOTA methods.

Conclusion: ReCOT reframes CVOGL as a recurrent localization problem, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency through token-based intent, iterative refinement, and segmentation priors, with robust error-correction potential.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

*Yiwei Xu,Xiang Wang,Yifei Yu,Wentian Gan,Luca Morelli,Giulio Perda,Xiongwu Xiao,Zongqian Zhan,Xin Wang,Fabio Remondino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TDOM enables near real-time True Digital Orthophoto Map generation by deploying On-the-Fly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) optimization. As new images arrive, pose and sparse point clouds are computed via On-the-Fly SfM, and new Gaussians are incrementally integrated and optimized in unseen or coarse regions, with orthogonal splatting enabling immediate rendering after each update. Initial experiments show near real-time rendering per image with seconds-level 3DGS optimization, maintaining acceptable geometric accuracy and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDOM generation relies on offline, complex photogrammetric pipelines, causing delays unsuitable for real-time applications. Challenges such as inaccurate camera poses and DSM/scene occlusions degrade TDOM quality. The work aims to enable near real-time TDOM generation to support time-sensitive geospatial workflows and robust performance.

Method: Use On-the-Fly Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to estimate camera pose and sparse point clouds as each image is acquired. Incrementally incorporate and optimize new Gaussians into previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions within a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework. Integrate with orthogonal splatting to render TDOM immediately after each 3DGS field update.

Result: Preliminary experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that A-TDOM can render TDOM in near real-time. Each new image triggers 3DGS optimization that runs in seconds, while preserving acceptable rendering quality and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Conclusion: A-TDOM proves the feasibility of near real-time TDOM generation using on-the-fly 3DGS optimization and incremental Gaussian updates. It enables immediate rendering after updates, suggesting potential for real-time geospatial applications, with room for improvements in speed, robustness, and scaling.

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

*Jonas Werheid,Shengjie He,Aymen Gannouni,Anas Abdelrazeq,Robert H. Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-efficient, CAD-based synthetic data pipeline for automated visual assembly control, enabling SMEs to train object detectors with high synthetic accuracy (mAP 99.5%) and strong real-world transfer (93%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMEs face high costs in data collection, labeling, and training CV models for assembly QA. Synthetic data offers a potential solution, but practical, easily integrable pipelines are scarce.

Method: Generate simulated scenes from CAD data and train object detectors within an end-to-end pipeline that rapidly produces labeled images for assembly components.

Result: Achieves mAP@0.5:0.95 up to 99.5% on synthetic training data; up to 93% when transferred to real camera-captured testing data, demonstrating effective synthetic-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: Synthetic CAD-based scene generation can be an effective, resource-efficient approach to visual assembly control, lowering barriers for SMEs to adopt CV-based quality control.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation suffers from multi-scale lesion variability, ill-defined boundaries, and heavy computation; there is a need for accurate, boundary-preserving, and efficient models suitable for clinical use.

Method: Introduce SHDCBlock (hybrid single-head self-attention + multi-scale dilated convolutions) to fuse local and global information; introduce DyFusionUp, a dynamic adaptive upsampling module with learnable offsets for high-fidelity feature reconstruction; adopt a lightweight design to reduce computation.

Result: On seven public datasets, DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, especially in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation, while maintaining lower computational complexity; code will be released.

Conclusion: DyGLNet demonstrates that combining global-local fusion with dynamic upsampling yields accurate, efficient medical image segmentation suitable for clinical analysis, with potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

### [53] [BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12768)
*Mohammed Al-Habib,Zuping Zhang,Abdulrahman Noman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST) introduces a two-stage ViT framework: MIM-based pretraining to learn transferable patch representations, followed by meta-fine-tuning with a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that combines Token Clustering, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting, and Bi-Level Attention, plus Graph Token Propagation and a Class Separation Penalty to refine token interactions and improve 1- and 5-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address core limitations of vision transformers in few-shot learning: insufficient token-level refinement, limited training data, and weak inductive biases. Existing methods rely on rigid token matching or simple similarity measures that fail to exploit global context and local refinement. The work aims to robustly refine token representations and strengthen inductive bias to boost few-shot discrimination.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) MIM-based pre-training to obtain transferable patch-level representations; (2) Meta-fine-tuning with a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement (BATR) module that (a) performs Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, (b) applies Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to emphasize reliable features, (c) uses Bi-Level Attention to balance intra- and inter-cluster relations. Additional components include Graph Token Propagation to align semantics between support and query and a Class Separation Penalty to reinforce class boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets show state-of-the-art performance in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, indicating that the Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement enhances few-shot classification via transformers.

Conclusion: BATR-FST demonstrates that coupling MIM pretraining with a bi-level, adaptive, token-refinement pipeline yields stronger token representations, improved inductive bias, and superior few-shot ViT performance, validating the effectiveness of refined token interactions and semantic consistency in few-shot transformer learning.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

### [54] [CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12777)
*Zhifang Gong,Shuo Gao,Ben Zhao,Yingjing Xu,Yijun Yang,Shenghong Ju,Guangquan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba framework automatically fuses multi-phase CECT data to discriminate pancreatic tumor subtypes, using spatial/temporal sampling, similarity-guided refinement, and multi-scale fusion, achieving high accuracy (97.4%) and AUC (98.6%) on PDAC vs PNETs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic tumor subtyping is hampered by high heterogeneity and variable multi-phase CECT data. Existing methods underutilize cross-phase contextual information across CECT phases, limiting diagnostic performance.

Method: Introduce a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module with two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to capture intra- and inter-phase contrast variations. Include a similarity-guided refinement module for temporal modeling to emphasize local tumor regions with temporal changes. Add a space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode/aggregate semantics across scales, enabling efficient learning for subtyping on a multi-phase CECT dataset.

Result: On an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases, the method achieves 97.4% accuracy and 98.6% AUC in distinguishing PDAC from PNETs, indicating strong discriminatory power and practical potential.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an automatic, efficient approach to integrate multi-phase CECT data for pancreatic tumor subtyping, leveraging temporal and spatial modeling to improve accuracy and potential clinical utility.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

### [55] [Modeling the Multivariate Relationship with Contextualized Representations for Effective Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12784)
*Zhehao Li,Yucheng Qian,Chong Wang,Yinghao Lu,Zhihao Yang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contextualized HOI detector that reasons with affordances and prompts over multivariate triplets (human, tool, object) to capture tool-dependent interactions and align language with image cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI detection suffers from incomplete context modeling; existing two-stage methods struggle with complex interactions and tool-mediated actions, necessitating richer relational reasoning and language-vision alignment.

Method: Introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning Network that (1) models affordances via triplets <human, tool, object>, (2) uses learnable prompts enriched with instance categories, and (3) fuses prompts with contextual visual features via attention to align language and image content at global and regional levels, integrating tools/auxiliary entities into HOI reasoning.

Result: On HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets, the approach yields superior performance in most scenarios, indicating better handling of context-dependent interactions.

Conclusion: Contextualized representations with affordance-guided triplet reasoning and prompt-based language-vision alignment effectively extend HOI detection to multivariate relationships and improve recognition of tool-dependent interactions; code anticipated upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

### [56] [Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787)
*Linchun Wu,Qin Zou,Xianbiao Qi,Bo Du,Zhongyuan Wang,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based cross-domain generator (DH-Diff) that jointly creates anomaly images and pixel-perfect masks with reduced feature entanglement and structural consistency, guided by text/graphical inputs; outperforms SOTA and improves downstream detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data must be structurally consistent with normal backgrounds and come with accurate pixel-wise masks, while avoiding feature entanglement between images and annotations that harms realism.

Method: Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff) architecture with cycles of feature separation, connection, and merging. Key components include a domain-decoupled attention mechanism that independently encodes image and mask features and a semantic score map alignment module that coherently integrates anomaly foregrounds. The framework supports text prompts and optional graphical guidance for flexible control, and cross-domain supervision to align the generated image and mask.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DH-Diff achieves higher diversity and perceptual authenticity than current state-of-the-art methods, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff provides a flexible, high-fidelity solution for synthetic anomaly data generation, addressing both structural consistency and feature-mask entanglement, and boosting detector performance with controllable generation via language or graphical inputs.

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

*Julien Walther,Rémi Giraud,Michaël Clément*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAM is a framework that generates accurate and regular superpixels by combining learned features with a large-scale semantic segmentation model, enabling alignment to object masks and interactive focusing, and it reportedly outperforms SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between accuracy and regularity in deep superpixels and improve interpretability by aligning with object-level masks while remaining flexible to incorporate prior segmentation.

Method: Train a feature extractor to generate superpixels; at inference use a pretrained semantic-agnostic segmentation model to guide superpixel boundaries; SPAM can incorporate any prior segmentation and support interactive focusing.

Result: Comprehensive experiments claim quantitative and qualitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods; code and pretrained models released.

Conclusion: SPAM provides a robust, versatile superpixel framework that harmonizes accuracy, regularity, and interpretability, with broad applicability and open-source availability.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

### [59] [SAGA: Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12817)
*Yuan Cao,Dong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGA introduces input-adaptive gates to selective information aggregation in linear attention, improving both efficiency and expressiveness over uniform KV compression, with significant throughput and memory benefits and accuracy gains on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax-based attention is O(N^2) and bottlenecks high-resolution vision tasks; linear attention reduces complexity to O(N) but suffers from low-rank KV due to uniform compression, causing directional misalignment with queries and a performance gap.

Method: Propose Selective Adaptive Gating for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) with input-adaptive gates to modulate information aggregation into the KV feature map, and an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition for gate computation that incurs no extra memory overhead.

Result: Achieves 1.76x throughput improvement and 2.69x reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at 1280x1280; up to 4.4% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SAGA provides both computational efficiency and improved expressiveness for linear attention by mitigating low-rank constraints in KV with adaptive gating, preserving the global receptive field and delivering practical gains on high-resolution vision tasks.

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Continual pretraining of two vision encoders on 3.5M chest X-rays shows encoder-specific strengths and strong gains from structured supervision; even modest in-domain data can beat open-weight models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models are limited by data scale; understanding how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in medical imaging is essential.

Method: Continuously pretrain two encoders (MedImageInsight MI2 and RAD-DINO) representing CLIP- and DINOv2-like paradigms on up to 3.5M chest X-rays from a single institution, with fixed compute/evaluation; evaluate on classification (findings, lines/tubes), segmentation, and radiology report generation; include lines/tubes tasks; compare with open-weight models; assess UniCL structured supervision.

Result: MI2 excels at finding-related tasks; RAD-DINO excels at tube-related tasks; UniCL structured supervision improves performance when continually pretraining with reports and labels; for some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples suffice to surpass open-weights models.

Conclusion: Center-specific continual pretraining is valuable, enabling institutions to gain significant performance through in-domain data and structured supervision; this helps bridge the gap between data-rich and data-scarce medical settings.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

*Shreyas Shivakumara,Gabriel Eilertsen,Karljohan Lundin Palmerius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fused NeRF quality metric is proposed by combining DISTS and VMAF, using two normalization schemes and two fusion methods, evaluated on Synthetic and Outdoor datasets across three configurations, yielding better correlation with subjective scores than individual metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF-generated outputs exhibit artifacts that current metrics struggle to capture; no single metric universally correlates with human judgments across datasets; combining complementary perceptual measures may improve alignment with subjective quality.

Method: Apply two normalization strategies to DISTS and VMAF, implement two fusion strategies, and evaluate their impact on correlation with subjective scores. Tests are conducted on two datasets (Synthetic and Outdoor) across three configurations; compare fused metrics against individual metrics.

Result: Fusion-based metrics show improved correlation with subjective quality scores compared with the individual DISTS or VMAF metrics, with results indicating robustness and generalizability across the two datasets.

Conclusion: Fusion of perceptual metrics is a promising direction for NeRF quality assessment, potentially offering better agreement with human judgments than single metrics; further exploration of normalization/fusion variants and broader testing could enhance generalizability.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

TL;DR: LLMs can synthesize labeled canine musculoskeletal visuals to augment scarce medical data; a model trained on synthetic data reached 88% F1 on a small real-world set for patellar luxation detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity for rare canine musculoskeletal conditions and the cost/rarity of real-world examples motivates synthetic data generation to improve AI performance.

Method: Map dog anatomy into 200+ labeled regions (muscles/joints), use guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompts to generate 1,000 synthetic visual documents for patellar luxation; then create 1,000 more across other diagnoses for binary datasets; evaluate a model trained on synthetic data on real data.

Result: Generated data were sensitive to anatomical location and severity, independent of sex; a model trained on synthetic data achieved 0.88 F1 on 70 real doc samples.

Conclusion: LLM-driven synthetic data generation can alleviate data scarcity in medical visual tasks and is adaptable to other domains.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

### [63] [Cumulative Consensus Score: Label-Free and Model-Agnostic Evaluation of Object Detectors in Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12871)
*Avinaash Manoharan,Xiangyu Yin,Domenik Helm,Chih-Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-free, deployment-friendly metric (CCS) for object detectors that uses test-time augmentations and IoU overlap consistency to proxy reliability without ground-truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth labels are often unavailable in deployment; need continuous monitoring of detectors without annotations.

Method: For each image, apply test-time augmentations, collect predicted boxes across augmented views, compute IoU overlaps between boxes across pairs, take maximum overlaps, normalize, and average across augmentation pairs to produce CCS.

Result: On Open Images and KITTI, CCS correlated >90% with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost; model-agnostic; works for single- and two-stage detectors; operates at the case level to identify underperforming scenarios.

Conclusion: CCS offers a robust, annotation-free foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

### [64] [Few to Big: Prototype Expansion Network via Diffusion Learner for Point Cloud Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12878)
*Qianguang Zhao,Dongli Wang,Yan Zhou,Jianxun Li,Richard Irampa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PENet expands few-shot 3D point cloud prototypes via dual sources (Intrinsic Learner and Diffusion Learner) to address intra-class diversity and inter-set inconsistency, using PAM with push-pull cross-guidance attention and PCM; achieves state-of-the-art on S3DIS/ScanNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods struggle due to limited prototype capacity to cover intra-class variability and misalignment with query features; diffusion models offer rich generalizable features to expand prototypes.

Method: A dual-stream architecture: Intrinsic Learner (supervised) + Diffusion Learner (pre-trained conditional encoder) to generate big-capacity prototypes; Prototype Assimilation Module with push-pull cross-guidance attention to align prototypes with query space; Prototype Calibration Mechanism to prevent semantic drift.

Result: PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various few-shot settings on S3DIS and ScanNet.

Conclusion: Leveraging diffusion-based features for prototype expansion yields more robust and aligned prototypes, improving few-shot 3D segmentation; the proposed modules effectively mitigate intra-class diversity and inter-set inconsistency.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

### [65] [Lego-Edit: A General Image Editing Framework with Model-Level Bricks and MLLM Builder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12883)
*Qifei Jia,Yu Liu,Yajie Chai,Xintong Yao,Qiming Lu,Yasen Zhang,Runyu Shi,Ying Huang,Guoquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lego-Edit uses a Multi-modal LLM with a modular, model-level toolkit and a three-stage progressive RL scheme to generalize instruction-based image editing to diverse real-world prompts, achieving SOTA on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench and enabling new tools without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world editing instructions are highly diverse and current methods struggle to generalize beyond their training domain; a scalable approach is needed to handle open-domain instructions without extensive retraining.

Method: Two design pillars: (1) a model-level toolkit of diverse, limited-data-trained image-editing models plus a set of image manipulation functions that the MLLM can compose; (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning framework that leverages feedback from unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM for generalized reasoning in editing tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench; demonstrates robust open-domain reasoning; can leverage newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Lego-Edit shows strong generalization for real-world instruction-based image editing by combining modular tool composition at the model level with progressive RL training, reducing the need for retraining when new tools appear; code is released.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

### [66] [Runge-Kutta Approximation and Decoupled Attention for Rectified Flow Inversion and Semantic Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12888)
*Weiming Chen,Zhihan Zhu,Yijia Wang,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RK-based high-order inversion for Rectified Flow models and a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA) to separate text-image attention, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity and editability in reconstruction and text-guided editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow (RF) models outperform DDIM-based diffusion models but face two practical issues: (i) low inversion accuracy, reducing consistency with the source image, and (ii) entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, hindering precise control of attention for edits. The work aims to improve both fidelity/consistency and controllability.

Method: 1) Develop an efficient high-order inversion method for RF models using a Runge-Kutta solver for differential equations. 2) Introduce Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA) to disentangle text and image attention inside multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling more precise semantic control.

Result: Experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing show state-of-the-art performance in fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: The proposed high-order inversion and DDTA address the main challenges in RF models: improving inversion accuracy/consistency and enabling precise attention control, leading to better reconstruction and editing capabilities. Code is released at the project URL.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

### [67] [MEJO: MLLM-Engaged Surgical Triplet Recognition via Inter- and Intra-Task Joint Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12893)
*Yiyi Zhang,Yuchen Yuan,Ying Zheng,Jialun Pei,Jinpeng Li,Zheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEJO: a framework for surgical triplet recognition that tackles inter- and intra-task optimization under long-tailed data, using shared-specific disentangled representations, MLLM-driven semantic augmentation, and coordinated gradient learning, achieving strong results on CholecT45/50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical triplet recognition suffers from long-tailed data distribution and optimization conflicts across and within tasks, limiting multi-task learning performance.

Method: MEJO introduces Shared-Specific Disentangled (S^2D) learning to split representations into task-shared and task-specific parts; a Multimodal LLM-powered probabilistic prompt pool augments visual features with expert semantic cues; distinct task prompts cover temporal-spatial cues; Coordinated Gradient Learning (CGL) rebalances positive/negative gradients from head and tail classes to coordinate learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on CholecT45 and CholecT50 show superior performance and effective handling of inter- and intra-task optimization conflicts.

Conclusion: MEJO effectively enables coordinated inter- and intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition and offers a robust approach for long-tailed multi-task settings.

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

*Leekyeung Han,Hyunji Min,Gyeom Hwangbo,Jonghyun Choi,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DialNav introduces a collaborative embodied dialog task with Navigator and Guide, paired with the RAIN dataset of human dialog and navigation trajectories, and provides a holistic benchmark and released resources for evaluating both dialog and navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for holistic evaluation of embodied dialog in navigation tasks, where success depends on effective communication and location inference by a Guide; fills a gap where prior work lacks integrated datasets and benchmarks.

Method: Define a two-agent DialNav task (Navigator and Guide). Collect Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN): photorealistic scenes with human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories. Develop a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate navigation and dialog jointly. Conduct extensive experiments across various Navigator and Guide model configurations to analyze performance and challenges. Publicly release dataset, code, and evaluation framework.

Result: Demonstrates the feasibility and value of holistic evaluation for embodied dialog; provides a new dataset and benchmark, enabling future research in joint navigation-dialog tasks. Identifies key challenges in the task and models.

Conclusion: DialNav and RAIN establish a new, holistic paradigm for embodied dialog research, with resources to drive reproducible evaluation and progress toward agents that can coordinate through dialog to achieve navigational goals.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

### [69] [Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)
*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS) adds a vision memory to stabilize and extend attention on key objects across LVLM layers, improving fine-grained visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often give brief attention to key objects; sustained attention is hypothesized to improve visual capabilities, especially relation and attribute understanding.

Method: Initialize a vision memory with first-layer, position-unbiased attention. In subsequent layers, attention uses the memory and is iteratively updated. Terminate smoothing when uncertainty indicates completed visual understanding.

Result: Evaluated on four benchmarks across three LVLMs, CLVS achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple visual understanding tasks, with notable gains in relation and attribute understanding.

Conclusion: Memory-based cross-layer attention smoothing stabilizes focus on key objects, enhancing visual reasoning and generalizing across models and tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

### [70] [MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901)
*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal scene-graph-guided infrared–visible fusion framework (MSGFusion) that uses text-derived scene graphs to explicitly model entities, attributes, and spatial relations, refining high-level semantics and low-level details to improve fusion quality and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrared–visible fusion methods rely mainly on low-level cues and unstructured text descriptions, lacking explicit modeling of objects, relations, and spatial localization; this limits fine-grained and semantically coherent fusion.

Method: Constructs multimodal scene graphs by aligning text- and vision-derived graphs, uses modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion to integrate high-level semantics with low-level details during fusion.

Result: On public benchmarks, MSGFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation and structural clarity, with better semantic consistency and generalizability to downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling entities, attributes, and relations via scene graphs enhances infrared–visible fusion, yielding more semantically coherent and detail-preserving results and broader applicability.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

*Branko Mitic,Philipp Seeböck,Helmut Prosch,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative anomaly detection framework using anomaly-free image translation plus patch-based similarity scoring improves unsupervised lesion segmentation in chest CT and brain MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normal fine-grained tissue variability in medical imaging hinders existing generative AD methods; there is a need for accurate unsupervised segmentation and anomaly detection across modalities.

Method: Two-stage approach: image-to-image translation to produce anomaly-free reconstructions; patch-level similarity scoring between observed and generated image patches to localize anomalies.

Result: Validated on chest CT for infectious lesion detection/segmentation and on brain MRI (ischemic stroke) showing Dice improvements of +1.9% (chest CT) and +4.4% (brain MRI) over state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Conclusion: Addresses tissue variability challenges in AD, improves pixel-level segmentation, and demonstrates cross-modality generalization, indicating promise for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

*Hojat Ardi,Amir Jahanshahi,Ali Diba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal-aware Siamese tracking (T-SiamTPN) adds explicit temporal modeling to a Siamese tracker to improve robustness in aerial object tracking under scale variation, occlusion, and dynamic backgrounds, while maintaining real-time efficiency on embedded hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of spatial-only cues and linear correlation in Siamese trackers, which struggle with long-term tracking, occlusions, and non-linear appearance changes in aerial scenes; leverage temporal dependencies for richer representations and consistency.

Method: Extend the SiamTPN architecture with temporal feature fusion and attention-based temporal interactions, enabling explicit temporal modeling and improved temporal consistency while preserving efficiency; deployed on Jetson Nano achieving 7.1 FPS.

Result: Significant performance gains over the baseline (e.g., +13.7% in success rate and +14.7% in precision); competitive with state-of-the-art trackers; real-time performance on embedded hardware with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling enhances Siamese tracking for aerial scenarios, yielding a strong and efficient tracker (T-SiamTPN); code release promised.

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

### [73] [A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918)
*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three-stage compression (sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation) applied to YOLOv8 on VisDrone achieves large reductions in parameters and FLOPs with only modest AP50 loss; TensorRT further boosts inference speed, enabling real-time edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, real-time aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices by compressing deep learning models without substantial performance loss.

Method: 1) Sparsity-aware training with dynamic sparsity to balance parameter reduction and accuracy. 2) Structured channel pruning using batch normalization scaling factors to remove redundant channels, reducing model size and compute. 3) Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) with adjustable temperature and loss weighting to recover accuracy after pruning. Experiments on VisDrone with YOLOv8 variants, notably YOLOv8m.

Result: Model parameters reduced 25.85M→6.85M (73.51%); FLOPs 49.6G→13.3G; MACs 101G→34.5G; AP50 drops by 2.7% (to 47.9). Inference speed improves from 26→45 FPS. TensorRT optimization yields AP50≈47.6 with 68 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage pipeline effectively compresses YOLOv8 for edge deployment with substantial resource reductions and minimal accuracy loss, achieving real-time inference on constrained devices; TensorRT provides additional speedups with small impact on accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

### [74] [MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924)
*Shipeng Liu,Ziliang Xiong,Khac-Hoang Ngo,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A regression-based PCR quality validator using multiscale features and attention aggregation; provides fine-grained misalignment estimates and improves downstream mapping quality over classification-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PCR quality validation treats misalignment as a few classes, which limits granularity and robustness, especially across data with varying densities. A finer, regression-based approach can better quantify registration error and guide downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes a regression model for PCR quality with extended multiscale feature extraction and attention-based feature aggregation to capture misalignment cues across spatial scales and densities.

Result: The proposed approach yields accurate and robust registration error estimates on diverse datasets, notably with heterogeneous densities, and improves downstream mapping quality for a fixed number of re-registered frames compared to the best classification-based method.

Conclusion: Regression-based PCR quality validation with multiscale features and attention aggregation provides finer, more reliable misalignment quantification and practical gains in SLAM/mapping pipelines over traditional classification-based validation.

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with

*Xiao Tang,Guirong Zhuo,Cong Wang,Boyuan Zheng,Minqing Huang,Lianqing Zheng,Long Chen,Shouyi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework (4DRadar-GS) for dynamic driving scenes that uses 4D radar for Gaussian initialization and a Velocity-guided PointTrack to achieve temporally consistent, high-quality 3D reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art results on OmniHD-Scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing self-supervised 3D reconstruction methods in dynamic scenes due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency; leverage 4D radar to recover depth scale and segment dynamic objects without bounding boxes.

Method: Introduce 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, creating Gaussian point representations; propose Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) trained with scene flow supervision to track fine-grained dynamics and enforce temporal consistency.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction on OmniHD-Scenes dataset.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction for dynamic driving scenarios, enabling better reconstruction and tracking of dynamic objects; suggests potential for broader adoption and future improvements.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

### [76] [Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian Splatting and Bag of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12938)
*Abdalla Arafa,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A paradigm-shifting, object-level semantic representation for 3D scenes using multiview CLIP embeddings of predecomposed Gaussians to enable open-vocabulary object retrieval and cross-task propagation without differentiable rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting yields fuzzy representations that hamper 3D scene understanding; 2D foundation-model distillation inherits alpha-blending limitations that obscure object-level semantics; a semantics approach that operates at object level and avoids differentiable rendering is needed.

Method: Predecomposed object Gaussians are represented by multiview CLIP feature aggregation, forming per-object bags of embeddings. Object-level embeddings enable open-vocabulary retrieval by text-query comparison, and IDs can be propagated to pixels for 2D segmentation or to Gaussians for 3D extraction, bypassing differentiable rendering for semantics.

Result: Experiments show improved 3D open-vocabulary object extraction without sacrificing 2D open-vocabulary segmentation performance, maintaining competitiveness with state-of-the-art while minimizing trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach shifts semantics away from differentiable rendering to object-level embedding representations, enabling robust 3D open-vocabulary understanding and flexible cross-task adaptation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

### [77] [Time-step Mixup for Efficient Spiking Knowledge Transfer from Appearance to Event Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12959)
*Yuqi Xie,Shuhan Ye,Chong Wang,Jiazhen Xu,Le Shen,Yuanbin Qian,Jiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-step Mixup Knowledge Transfer (TMKT) enables cross-modal knowledge transfer from RGB to DVS for spiking neural networks by mixing inputs at multiple time steps and using modality-aware auxiliary losses; yields smoother transfer and improved spiking image classification across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce sparse, asynchronous data with limited availability, and there is a large distribution gap between RGB and DVS modalities. Transferring semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS is challenging due to modality shift and data scarcity. A cross-modal, time-aware learning approach could improve training efficiency and performance for energy-efficient SNNs.

Method: Proposes Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT): a fine-grained mixing strategy that interpolates RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps within the asynchronous dynamics of spiking neural networks. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, it introduces modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives that support the time-step mixup process and enhance cross-modality discrimination.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TMKT across multiple datasets, showing superior performance in spiking image classification tasks and smoother knowledge transfer with reduced modality shift.

Conclusion: TMKT effectively bridges the RGB–DVS modality gap for SNNs, enabling smoother cross-modal knowledge transfer and improved accuracy in energy-efficient visual classification; the authors plan to release code after the double-blind review.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

### [78] [MMMS: Multi-Modal Multi-Surface Interactive Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12963)
*Robin Schön,Julian Lorenz,Katja Ludwig,Daniel Kienzle,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interactive multi-modal, multi-surface segmentation (MMMS) using a black-box RGB backbone, with encoded clicks and non-RGB modalities; introduces an extended evaluation metric for entangled surfaces; achieves reductions in NoC@90; RGB-only baseline competitive for single-mask tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of multiple, potentially entangled surfaces inside a single image requires efficient interaction, robustness to multiple modalities, and respect for a black-box RGB backbone. There's also a need for an evaluation metric that fairly assesses multi-surface segmentation performance.

Method: A network architecture that accepts an RGB image, multiple non-RGB modalities, an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. The RGB backbone is treated as a black box; interaction-specific information is integrated after image feature extraction and multi-modal fusion. The approach is framed as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface interactive segmentation (MMMS) and evaluated on DeLiVER and MFNet, with an extended metric for multiple surfaces.

Result: The method reduces NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 clicks per surface on MFNet. The RGB-only baseline is competitive or even superior in traditional single-mask interactive segmentation scenarios.

Conclusion: Multi-modal fusion in MMMS improves segmentation performance for multi-surface scenarios while respecting a black-box RGB backbone and enabling efficient interaction. The extended metric addresses the challenges of entangled surfaces, and the approach shows strong gains across datasets; the RGB-only baseline remains competitive in single-surface tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot competition (FEST) for text line segmentation in ancient handwritten documents, using only 3 annotated images per manuscript on a diverse U-DIADS-TL dataset, to develop robust, adaptable methods for humanities research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets are scarce for historical manuscripts, and handwriting is irregular with degraded ink and complex layouts; there is a need for adaptable, low-annotation methods to enable humanities scholars to apply automated text line segmentation.

Method: The FEST competition tasks participants to build systems that segment text lines in the U-DIADS-TL dataset, trained with only three annotated images per manuscript, reflecting a few-shot learning setting on diverse, degraded, non-standard manuscripts.

Result: Not stated in the abstract; the paper introduces the competition and dataset but does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: FEST aims to promote robust and adaptable few-shot text line segmentation methods that can be used by humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation, fostering broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

TL;DR: Electrostatic potential as a complementary descriptor improves protein surface shape retrieval; 9 teams evaluated 15 methods on 11,555 surfaces; best results from electrostatics-assisted methods, including data-scarce classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance retrieval accuracy by integrating electrostatic potential with geometric surface shape to capture physicochemical properties influencing recognition; address data scarcity by robust descriptor combination.

Method: SHREC 2025 track with 9 teams and 15 submitted methods on a dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces annotated with electrostatic potential. Performance was evaluated using Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1, Precision, and Recall. Comparisons were made between methods leveraging electrostatics and those relying on surface shape alone, including analysis for data-limited classes.

Result: Best retrieval performance was achieved by methods that used electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape; the advantage held for classes with limited data.

Conclusion: Integrating electrostatic potential with molecular surface shape descriptors improves protein surface shape retrieval and highlights the value of multi-descriptor approaches, especially for data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER introduces adaptive Gaussian noise to SIREN initialization to mitigate spectral bottlenecks and spectral bias, improving fitting across audio, image, and 3D data without extra trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN can underfit signals outside its frequency support; spectral bottleneck leads to near-zero outputs even within capacity; need target-aware initialization to better cover spectral content.

Method: Perturb uniformly initialized SIREN weights by Gaussian noise; noise scale is adaptively set from the spectral centroid of the target signal; analogous to random Fourier embeddings but without extra parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting over base SIREN.

Conclusion: Adaptive, target-aware initialization like WINNER broadens SIREN's representational reach and suggests a general strategy for training deep nets without adding trainable parameters.

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework for detecting incorrect user actions in egocentric video, combining frozen and LoRA-tuned ViViT features via a feature-level expert, and using three multi-objective classifiers (reweighted cross-entropy, AUC loss, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization) with classifier-level fusion, achieving strong performance on rare/ambiguous mistakes; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtle and infrequent mistakes in egocentric action understanding are challenging due to class imbalance, ambiguity, and the need for reliable calibration and generalization.

Method: Stage 1 features are extracted from a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model and combined through a feature-level expert module. Stage 2 trains three classifiers with different objectives: (i) reweighted cross-entropy to address class imbalance, (ii) AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and (iii) label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Predictions are fused via a classification-level expert module.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance, especially in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: DR-MoE provides an effective and calibrated framework for detecting subtle, infrequent user mistakes in egocentric video, leveraging multi-stage MoE fusion and diverse loss objectives to handle imbalance and ambiguity.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three

mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to

### [84] [Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12995)
*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple linear classifier on a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) outperforms bespoke detectors for AI-generated image detection in-the-wild, boosting accuracy by over 20% and revealing that VFMs’ power comes from aligning synthetic images with forgery-related concepts; true generalization requires test data independent of the model’s training history (pretraining).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized detectors for AI-generated images perform poorly in real-world, in-the-wild benchmarks, yielding high false negatives. There is a need for robust detection that generalizes beyond curated benchmarks and pretraining data.

Method: Train a simple linear classifier on top of a modern Vision Foundation Model using the same data as bespoke detectors. Then analyze why the VFM provides strong detection power by examining text-image alignment (e.g., alignment to forgery-related concepts) and the impact of data exposure relative to the pretraining cut-off on model performance.

Result: A baseline linear classifier on a VFM significantly outperforms bespoke detectors in-the-wild, achieving >20% accuracy gain. The VFM’s power appears to stem from alignment of synthetic images with forgery-related concepts, which is stronger in current VFM versions (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2). This alignment and overall accuracy degrade on a new dataset collected after the VFM’s pretraining cut-off, suggesting unseen during pre-training.

Conclusion: 1) For real-world AI-generated image detection, updating to a newer VFM is more effective than designing static detectors. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data independent of the model’s entire training history, including pretraining data.

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neuromorphic drone detection using spiking neural networks and event cameras deployed on neuromorphic chips to form scalable, energy-efficient 'tripwire' systems; training with synthetic data; the model appears to rely on drone shape rather than propeller timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the threat of small drones and the need for autonomous, energy-efficient detection in power-constrained or contested environments by leveraging fully neuromorphic sensing and processing.

Method: Integrate spiking neural networks with event cameras (neuromorphic sensors); deploy the detection model on a neuromorphic chip; use multiple units to create a virtual tripwire; explore training with synthetically generated data and analyze feature cues (shape vs temporal propeller patterns).

Result: The neuromorphic solution is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference edge-GPU solution, enabling operation for over a year on battery power; deployment of multiple units allows detection of when/where drones enter restricted zones; analysis suggests the model relies on drone shape rather than propeller timing.

Conclusion: A fully neuromorphic drone-detection system offers long-term, power-efficient operation suitable for deployment in power-limited or contested areas; synthetic data can be effectively used for training, and the approach supports scalable, location-aware monitoring via virtual tripwires.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

*Gaofeng Liu,Hengsen Li,Ruoyu Gao,Xuetong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Tao Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage Dream3DAvatar framework for monocular full-body 3D avatar generation that uses Pose-Adapter and ID-Adapter modules to steer multi-view generation, a BLIP2-based text controller, and a second-stage Transformer to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling animation-ready avatars with superior baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D avatar reconstruction is highly ill-posed, especially for occluded regions; there is a need for cross-view consistency, facial identity preservation, and text-driven control to guide geometry, texture, and details without excessive post-processing.

Method: Stage 1: lightweight multi-view generation with Pose-Adapter injecting SMPL-X renderings and skeletal cues into SDXL to enforce geometry/pose consistency; ID-Adapter-G injects high-res facial features; BLIP2 creates descriptive text for multi-view images. Stage 2: a feedforward Transformer with a multi-view feature fusion module reconstructs 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS) from images; ID-Adapter-R uses gating to fuse facial features for high-frequency detail recovery; results in animation-ready 3D avatars with no post-processing.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method produces realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars and consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics related to realism, geometry/texture fidelity, and animation compatibility.

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar provides an efficient, text-controllable pipeline for monocular full-body 3D avatar generation, effectively addressing ill-posed reconstruction and occlusion challenges by leveraging adapter-guided view consistency, facial identity preservation, and multi-view feature fusion, yielding high-quality, ready-to-animate avatars without post-processing.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: A two-stage RL framework for vision-language models (PeBR-R1) that jointly enhances perception and reasoning, using dataset-level sampling to mitigate vanishing advantage; Stage 1 improves coarse/fine visual understanding, Stage 2 improves reasoning; validated on seven benchmarks with strong results.


<details>

Motivation: VLMs must first perceive visual input before reasoning, unlike LLMs where RL often focuses on reasoning alone. Directly transplanting RL from LLMs is suboptimal for VLMs due to higher task complexity and the necessity of perceptual grounding. The work aims to jointly improve perception and reasoning and address training instabilities (vanishing advantage) via dataset-level sampling.

Method: A two-stage RL framework with dataset-level sampling. Stage 1 focuses on improving visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding. Stage 2 targets reasoning improvements. Data sources are used selectively to strengthen specific capabilities and avoid interference, mitigating vanishing advantages during RL training.

Result: PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities, shows superior performance across seven benchmark datasets for diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: A targeted, two-stage RL approach with dataset-level sampling effectively strengthens both perception and reasoning in VLMs. PeBR-R1 demonstrates robust, cross-task improvements and validates the feasibility of decoupling perceptual and reasoning optimization in VLM training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

*Xu Li,Yuxuan Liang,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO reduces visual token count in high-resolution vision-language models via content-adaptive token budgeting and function-aware selection, preserving accuracy with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HR-LVLMs that crop images into local tiles massively increase token counts, leading to high computational and memory costs; understanding token usage is needed to enable efficient inference.

Method: First, empirically analyze token importance and CLS token attention patterns; then propose HERO, a training-free framework that estimates tile-level importance and selects tokens with complementary roles through early dropping and content-aware budget allocation.

Result: HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales without additional training.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical insights and a practical, training-free solution for efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

### [89] [TFANet: Three-Stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network for Robust Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13070)
*Qianqi Lu,Yuxiang Xie,Jing Zhang,Shiwei Zou,Yan Chen,Xidao Luan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TFANet presents a three-stage image-text feature alignment network for referring image segmentation, using hierarchical alignment modules to improve cross-modal matching and mitigate semantic loss in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Referring image segmentation requires fine-grained alignment between image regions and language. Existing methods suffer from multimodal misalignment and language semantic degradation, especially in scenes with multiple visually similar objects, leading to mislocalization or incomplete segmentation. TFANet aims to systematically enhance cross-modal alignment through a structured, hierarchical framework.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS) with Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM) to enable bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and text at multiple scales; (2) Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS) with Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM) to perform multimodal selective scanning, capturing long-range dependencies and building a unified multimodal representation; (3) Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS) with Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate semantic degradation from earlier stages.

Result: The abstract claims improved multimodal alignment and segmentation accuracy in complex scenes, but provides no quantitative results or metrics.

Conclusion: TFANet's staged design progressively strengthens cross-modal alignment and semantic depth, enabling more accurate localization of uniquely described targets in challenging RIS scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

*Yan Xingyang,Huang Xiaohong,Zhang Zhao,You Tian,Xu Ziheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-aware image enhancement with LLFDisc, using a distribution-aware Fourier-domain loss and KL-Divergence-based perceptual loss to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Fourier space, luminance sits in the amplitude while spatial structures are in the phase. Pixel-wise losses (e.g., MSE) overemphasize local details and can degrade global information. A loss that directly fits Fourier-domain information could better preserve global fidelity.

Method: Introduce LLFDisc, a U-shaped network with cross-attention and gating designed for frequency-aware enhancement. Propose a distribution-aware loss that directly fits Fourier-domain information by minimizing a closed-form KL-Divergence between Fourier-domain distributions. Improve perceptual (VGG) loss by embedding KL-Divergence on deep features.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code will be released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: The approach improves alignment of Fourier-domain information with structural fidelity, yielding robust improvement over traditional pixel-wise losses and standard perceptual losses.

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

### [91] [Enhancing Dual Network Based Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Uncertainty-Guided Pseudo-Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13084)
*Yunyao Lu,Yihang Wu,Ahmad Chaddad,Tareef Daqqaq,Reem Kateb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-network semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework that uses cross consistency, dynamic pseudo-label weighting via KL-divergence, and self-supervised contrastive learning to handle noisy labels and limited annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation requires large amounts of labeled data, which is impractical in real-world settings. Unlabeled data can be leveraged via semi-supervised learning, but pseudo-labels are noisy and supervision in feature space is weak.

Method: A dual-network architecture with a Cross Consistency Enhancement module that uses cross pseudo-labels and entropy-filtered supervision; an uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting strategy (based on KL divergence) to adjust pseudo-label contributions; a self-supervised contrastive learning component to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes, distinguishing trustworthy vs uncertain predictions.

Result: Experiments on three 3D datasets (Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas, BraTS-2019) show superior performance, including 89.95% Dice on the Left Atrium with only 10% labeled data; ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates noisy pseudo-labels and limited supervision by integrating cross-consistency, uncertainty-aware weighting, and contrastive learning, yielding strong semi-supervised 3D segmentation results.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

TL;DR: HDFF is an ensemble of Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT for deepfake detection; achieves 0.96852 on private leaderboard (20th of 184).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization challenge in detecting facial forgeries across diverse manipulation techniques; robust cross-technique detection is needed, and single-model approaches may lack generalization. An ensemble that fuses diverse architectures can leverage complementary strengths.

Method: Multi-stage fine-tuning of four pre-trained sub-models (Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, DaViT) on the MultiFFDI dataset; extract feature representations from each model; concatenate these features; train a final classifier on the fused features.

Result: 0.96852 score on the competition's private leaderboard, ranking 20th out of 184 teams.

Conclusion: Hierarchical fusion of diverse architectures can improve performance on complex image classification tasks like deepfake detection by leveraging complementary strengths of the sub-models.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant
challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries,
especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for
high-performance facial forgery detection. Our framework integrates four
diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT,
which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the
MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these
specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex
image classification tasks.

### [93] [Weakly and Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13116)
*Ruibo Li,Hanyu Shi,Zhe Wang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic LiDAR motion prediction using vegetation/foreground and ground cues; replaces motion labels with masks; introduces a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance and multi-frame learning; achieves strong results with minimal annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion understanding in dynamic driving scenes is crucial, and reducing annotation effort is highly desirable. Leveraging scene structure (foreground vs background, ground vs non-ground) enables supervision for motion prediction without dense labels.

Method: Proposes a weakly supervised paradigm that uses fully/partially annotated foreground/background masks (as low as 0.01%); also uses non-ground/ground cues as alternatives; introduces two variants (0.01% foreground/background, and a self-supervised method with no annotations); employs a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalties to handle outliers.

Result: Weakly supervised and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts; weakly supervised models rival some supervised methods, illustrating favorable annotation-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective reduction of annotation effort while maintaining competitive performance in class-agnostic motion prediction for LiDAR, aided by foreground/background or non-ground/ground cues and a robust multi-frame loss.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

*Zhihao Zhang,Chunyu Lin,Lang Nie,Jiyuan Wang,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CRPS-D, a large-scale parking slot detection dataset, and SS-PSD, a semi-supervised baseline using teacher-student with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation to improve detection under noisy real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable, diverse, and noisy-condition parking-slot data, and reducing annotation cost through unlabeled data.

Method: Construct CRPS-D with varied lighting, weather, and slanted slots; propose SS-PSD, a semi-supervised parking-slot detector based on a teacher-student framework with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.

Result: SS-PSD outperforms state-of-the-art on CRPS-D and existing datasets; gains grow with more unlabeled data; code and dataset publicly available.

Conclusion: First semi-supervised approach in parking slot detection; dataset provides large-scale, diverse data; method reduces labeling burden and enhances robustness to noise.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

*Minqing Huang,Shouyi Lu,Boyuan Zheng,Ziyao Li,Xiao Tang,Guirong Zhuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDNet introduces a two-stage distillation framework to convert dense LiDAR priors into 4D radar features for super-resolution. Stage 1: reconstruction-guided feature distillation to densify features; Stage 2: diffusion-guided distillation using a lightweight diffusion network, aided by a noise adapter. Results show high-fidelity, low-latency 4D radar point-cloud super-resolution on VoD and in-house data, with improved downstream task performance; code release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar super-resolution faces a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Existing approaches are costly to train or rely on diffusion-based sampling, leading to high inference latency and limited generalization. There is a need to efficiently transfer dense LiDAR priors to radar features to improve reconstruction quality without prohibitive compute.

Method: MSDNet is a two-stage distillation framework. Stage 1 performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation to align and densify the student (radar) features via feature reconstruction. Stage 2 performs diffusion-guided feature distillation, treating stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher (LiDAR) representations and refining them with a lightweight diffusion network. A noise adapter is included to align the noise level with a predefined diffusion timestep for more precise denoising.

Result: Experiments on VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with low-latency inference in 4D radar point-cloud super-resolution and yields consistent improvements on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: MSDNet enables efficient, accurate 4D radar super-resolution by transferring dense LiDAR priors through multi-stage distillation, balancing accuracy and efficiency and improving generalization across downstream tasks.

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Motivation: Accurate recognition of text attributes (bold/italic/underline/strikeout) is essential for document understanding but existing TAR methods struggle with noise, multilingual data, and efficiency; a method that models local/global context and uses diverse data is needed.

Method: Proposes TexTAR architecture: a multi-task Transformer for TAR with a novel data selection pipeline to enhance context awareness, and a 2D RoPE-style mechanism to fuse input context into attribute prediction. Introduces MMTAD dataset with annotations across legal records, notices, textbooks.

Result: TexTAR achieves state-of-the-art TAR performance, outperforming existing methods, and demonstrates that contextual awareness improves accuracy across datasets. Emphasizes efficiency and robustness in noisy/multilingual settings.

Conclusion: Contextual awareness and data selection are crucial for robust Textual Attribute Recognition; TexTAR provides a strong, versatile framework and MMTAD offers a diverse benchmark for future TAR research.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute
Recognition (TAR). Our novel data selection pipeline enhances context
awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional
Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate
attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual,
multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents
such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

*Zhihao He,Tianyao He,Tieyuan Chen,Yun Xu,Huabin Liu,Chaofan Gan,Gui Zou,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-video collaborative framework for video-language models using a spatio-temporal graph representation and fusion mechanism to enhance reasoning while avoiding token overload, validated by extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-video VLMs suffer from spatio-temporal incompleteness leading to hallucinations; leveraging related videos can fill gaps, but raw aggregation is inefficient due to redundancy and token explosion. A structured, graph-based fusion strategy can efficiently integrate cross-video knowledge for robust reasoning.

Method: 1) Video Structuring Module builds a spatio-temporal knowledge graph from each video. 2) Graph Fusion Module merges structured knowledge with relevant information from related videos to augment graph node tokens. 3) A multi-video structured prompt combines graph, visual, and textual tokens as input to a large language model for reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in improving video reasoning and reducing hallucinations, indicating strong potential for advancing video-language models.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-video structured, graph-based framework offers a promising and scalable direction for enhancing video-language models by efficiently leveraging related videos through structured representation and prompt design.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

It supports over 10 tasks, with baselines for tree species classification and individual tree segmentation, highlighting the promise of multi-modal fusion and cross-domain generalization, and outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, up-to-date street tree inventories are essential for urban livability and planning, yet traditional field surveys are slow and costly.

The dataset enables multi-modal fusion approaches and multi-task analyses, and the paper demonstrates baselines for tree species classification and individual tree segmentation. Findings emphasize the value of cross-city, cross-domain generalization and identify challenges and future directions for leveraging multi-modal data in street-tree inventory.

Conclusion: WHU-STree is a valuable resource for advancing multi-task, cross-city street tree research and practical asset management. It underscores the potential of multi-modal fusion, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and integration with multi-modal LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs enable scalable silver-standard labeling from radiology reports to pre-train vision-language models, achieving strong zero-shot and cross-modal performance with a lightweight 3D ResNet-18, at low labeling cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data labeling is expensive and scarce in medical vision-language pre-training. The work leverages LLMs to extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports to create large-scale, affordable training data, democratizing access to supervised pre-training.

Method: Use LLMs to automatically extract diagnostic labels from CT radiology reports to form a large silver-standard dataset (~50k image-report pairs) costing ~$3. Train a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP on this data. Compare with labels produced by BERT-based models. Evaluate zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT and assess cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50, Recall@100).

Result: Label extraction achieves >96% AUC. Vision encoder trained on silver-standard data attains performance comparable to BERT-labeled datasets. With 3D ResNet-18 and CLIP, state-of-the-art results: zero-shot AUC 83.8% on CT-RATE and 77.3% on RAD-ChestCT; cross-modal retrieval: MAP@50=53.7% (image-image), Recall@100=52.2% (report-image). Cost-effective data generation (~$3 for 50k pairs).

Conclusion: LLMs can substantially improve and scale medical vision-language pre-training by providing high-quality labels at low cost, enabling more performant and scalable medical AI. Code available at the linked repository.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

*Shyam Nandan Rai,Shyamgopal Karthik,Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu,Barbara Caputo,Carlo Masone,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes road-obstacle segmentation as a temporal problem, building four road-obstacle video benchmarks, evaluating 11 baselines (image- and video-based), introducing two vision foundation-model baselines, and achieving state-of-the-art results for long-range road-obstacle video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road-obstacle segmentation has been treated on a frame-by-frame basis, ignoring temporal correlations between consecutive frames. Since consecutive segmentation maps are strongly correlated, exploiting temporal information should improve consistency and accuracy. The authors also provide benchmarks to spur progress in this temporally-aware task.

Method: Curate and adapt four road-obstacle video segmentation benchmarks; evaluate 11 state-of-the-art methods from image- and video-based segmentation on these benchmarks; propose two strong baselines based on vision foundation models.

Result: The proposed temporal evaluation and baselines achieve new state-of-the-art performance for long-range road-obstacle video segmentation and demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging temporal information and the value of the provided benchmarks.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling is essential for road-obstacle segmentation. The benchmarks and strong baselines offer valuable guidance for future research, highlighting the need to design temporally consistent, long-range video segmentation methods for road obstacles.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video
sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vi-SAFE is a spatial-temporal violence detection framework that combines an enhanced YOLOv8 (GhostNetV3, EMA, pruning) with TSN, achieving 0.88 accuracy on RWF-2000 and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in violence detection from public surveillance: small targets, complex environments, and real-time temporal analysis.

Method: Train YOLOv8 to extract human regions and TSN for binary violence classification; YOLOv8 uses GhostNetV3 backbone, EMA attention, and pruning; separate training on pedestrian and violence datasets; TSN operates on extracted regions.

Result: On RWF-2000, Vi-SAFE achieves 0.88 accuracy, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE demonstrates effectiveness for public safety surveillance; code is available at the provided URL.

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

*Fei Wang,Xuecheng Wu,Zheng Zhang,Danlei Huang,Yuheng Huang,BoWang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End4: an end-to-end denoising detector for diffusion-based inpainting that aligns latent spaces through reconstruction and refines features with a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM). It introduces a five-region inpainting benchmark and shows strong generalization to unseen masks and robustness to perturbations; code and dataset to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models enable high-quality inpainting, raising misuse concerns. Existing detectors struggle to identify diffusion-based inpainting, especially when similar inpainted images are in training data; a generalizable, robust detector is needed.

Method: Propose End4 with (1) an end-to-end denoising reconstruction model to better align latent spaces for detection, producing features favorable to detection; (2) a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local features using attention pyramid layers at multiple scales; (3) a benchmark with five distinct masking regions to evaluate detection on inpainted images.

Result: Extensive experiments show End4 generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations; performance surpasses baselines (as claimed).

Conclusion: End4 provides a robust, generalizable detection framework for diffusion-based inpainting images and will have accompanying code and dataset released.

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CMTSSL, a curriculum-based, self-supervised framework for hyperspectral imaging that jointly tackles masked image modeling and spatial-spectral jigsaw puzzles using lightweight encoders, improving downstream segmentation while enabling onboard deployment; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional hyperspectral data and limited satellite bandwidth necessitate compact, efficient models that can learn robust representations without heavy supervision, enabling onboard processing and data reduction.

Method: A curriculum multi-task self-supervised framework (CMTSSL) that combines masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzles, guided by curriculum learning to progressively increase data complexity; yields a unified, computationally efficient encoder capable of capturing spectral continuity, spatial structure, and semantic features, suitable for lightweight architectures on board.

Result: Across four public datasets, CMTSSL achieves consistent improvements in downstream segmentation; the lightweight models are demonstrated to be over 16,000× smaller than some state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CMTSSL offers effective, generalizable representation learning for lightweight hyperspectral models suitable for onboard satellite deployment and real-world applications; the authors released the code publicly.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: Achieve consistent part quality amid material and tooling variability while reducing data requirements.

Method: Developed a visual dataset from vacuum-formed samples across parameter variations; applied image augmentation; used k-Nearest Neighbors to suggest parameter adjustments by aligning low-quality parts with high-quality counterparts; focused on heating power, heating time, and vacuum time.

Result: Demonstrated strong capability of the model to adjust the three process parameters, reducing defects and improving production efficiency.

Conclusion: Vision-based quality control with minimal data and instance-based learning can effectively predict and optimize vacuum thermoforming process parameters.

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

*Mattia Soldan,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Bernard Ghanem,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A ResidualViT framework reduces computational cost for temporally dense video tasks by exploiting temporal redundancy: residual connections for consistency, token reduction to discard redundant frames, and distillation to approximate the original foundation model; achieves up to 60% cost savings and 2.5x faster inference while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally dense video understanding tasks need high frame-rate features but are expensive to compute; there is significant redundancy across consecutive frames that can be exploited to speed up inference without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Proposes ResidualViT architecture with learnable residual connections and a token reduction module; uses a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate original frame-level features; reuses pretrained foundation model weights.

Result: Evaluated on four tasks and five datasets, in zero-shot and supervised settings; achieves up to 60% computational cost reduction and up to 2.5x speedup, with accuracy closely matching the original foundation model.

Conclusion: Efficient temporally dense video feature extraction is feasible using ResidualViT with residual temporal modeling, selective token reduction, and distillation, enabling faster inference across multiple tasks without large accuracy loss.

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGame is an AI-driven gamified radiology training platform with two modules (Localize and Report) that uses public datasets and automated feedback to improve localization and report-writing; in prospective evaluation, localization accuracy improved by 68% (vs 17% with passive methods) and report-writing by 31% (vs 4%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radical gap: traditional radiology training provides limited immediate, scalable feedback; need scalable, structured AI feedback to accelerate learning.

Method: RadGame Localize: players draw bounding boxes; comparison to radiologist annotations; visual explanations via vision-language models. RadGame Report: generate findings given exam data; AI feedback based on generation metrics; ground-truth reports from public datasets; final performance/style score. Prospective evaluation with participants using same cases for both methods.

Result: 68% improvement in localization accuracy versus 17% with traditional methods; 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy versus 4% with traditional methods.

Conclusion: AI-powered gamification can provide scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and expand the use of medical AI resources in education.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework uses vision–language model–generated textual descriptions to quantify perceptual realism of AI-generated images and localize inconsistencies, achieving better global realism scores and dense localization maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain reliable, scalable realness assessments and local inconsistency localization without relying on costly human annotations, enabling improved photorealism through training feedback.

Method: Leverages vision–language models trained on large datasets to generate textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies. These descriptions supervise a model that predicts global realness and produces dense realness maps indicating inconsistent regions.

Result: The approach improves objective realness prediction and yields dense realness maps that distinguish realistic from unrealistic spatial regions.

Conclusion: A multimodal, description-guided framework can jointly assess overall realism and local inconsistencies, providing valuable feedback for improving photorealism in AI-generated images.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

*Zefan Qu,Zhenwei Wang,Haoyuan Wang,Ke Xu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method (StyleSculptor) enables zero-shot, style-guided 3D asset generation from a content image and style images with fine-grained control over texture, geometry, or both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable flexible, zero-shot style-controlled 3D asset generation that preserves content while injecting user-specified texture/geometry styles, addressing the challenge of style-controllable 3D generation without training.

Method: Introduce StyleSculptor with Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn), a cross-3D attention mechanism that fuses content and style features while disentangling style from content via variance-based feature selection. Also propose Style Guided Control (SGC) for exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization and adjustable style intensity.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in producing high-fidelity 3D assets; achieves stable feature fusion and effective zero-shot style-guided generation.

Conclusion: StyleSculptor enables zero-shot, fine-grained 3D style control by dynamically computing texture- and geometry-guided features through SD-Attn and SGC, eliminating the need for training while offering precise style manipulation.

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Motivation: To bridge 2D priors and 3D spatial reasoning, unifying 2D and 3D representations for robust scene understanding while reducing labeling burden through flexible region prompts.

Method: Enrich 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings and train a shared visual token space that supports region prompting via bounding boxes or masks on any frame or in 3D, enabling cross-view spatial reasoning without exhaustive multi-frame labeling and leveraging 2D priors for 3D reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on general 2D vision-language tasks and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks; demonstrates strong performance in-the-wild on videos lacking 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, with accurate spatial relationships and metric measurements.

Conclusion: SR-3D effectively unifies 2D and 3D representations for scene understanding, with flexible region prompting and 3D-aware features enabling robust cross-view spatial reasoning across frames.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PowerGrow is a co-generative framework that jointly synthesizes grid topology and nodal dynamics using a hierarchical graph diffusion process for structure and a temporal autoencoder for time-series data, achieving high feasibility and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available, realistic power-grid test cases are scarce due to security concerns and anonymization effort. A generative tool that can produce feasible, dynamic grid scenarios would accelerate research and benchmarking.

Method: Factorize the joint distribution into conditional generations: topology via hierarchical graph beta-diffusion, time-series loads via a temporal autoencoder latent space, and other attributes with constrained generation to ensure feasibility. The framework emphasizes dependences across stages (dependence decomposition) to maintain physical validity while reducing computation.

Result: PowerGrow reports higher fidelity and diversity than prior diffusion models, a 98.9% power flow convergence rate, and improved N-1 contingency resilience, indicating operational validity and realism of generated grids.

Conclusion: PowerGrow demonstrates the feasibility of joint topology and dynamics generation for power grids and offers a scalable path to rich, realistic benchmarks for research and testing.

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Presents DBench for benchmarking decentralized data-parallel DNN training and Ada, an adaptive graph approach, showing strong convergence and competitive accuracy at large scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized learning promises efficiency but is not production-ready due to stability, scalability, and generality gaps. Large-scale benchmarking is needed to understand how communication topology and scale affect model accuracy.

Method: Introduce DBench to compare centralized and decentralized training; develop benchmarking methodology by varying communication graphs and training scales; analyze how accuracy correlates with variance of parameter tensors; propose Ada, a decentralized SGD variant that dynamically adapts the communication graph during training.

Result: Findings include: (1) decentralized training faces scalability and generality issues at large scale similar to centralized learning; (2) model accuracy correlates with the number of connections in the communication graph; (3) model accuracy is highly sensitive to variance of parameter tensors across replicas; Ada achieves best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN training and matches or closely matches centralized accuracy across tasks, even for ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1K at 1008 GPUs.

Conclusion: Dynamic graph-adaptive decentralized training can match centralized performance and improve scalability and generality; DBench provides a practical benchmarking framework, and Ada demonstrates the potential of adaptive communication graphs for large-scale decentralized learning.

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

### [112] [MEUV: Achieving Fine-Grained Capability Activation in Large Language Models via Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12221)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Meng Han,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MEUV, a framework that factorizes a monolithic refusal signal into topic-aligned, nearly orthogonal vectors to enable fine-grained, language-agnostic control of LLM safety, achieving strong topic-specific bypass performance with reduced cross-topic leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome blanket safety refusals that block legitimate high-stakes uses; prior refusal-edits rely on a single vector that lacks semantic control over separate sensitive topics.

Method:  MEUV factorizes the refusal direction into topic-aligned, nearly orthogonal vectors learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective combining differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and auxiliary terms; evaluated on bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks using Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen-7B.

Result: Achieves an attack success rate of at least 87% on the benchmarks; reduces cross-topic leakage by up to 90% relative to the best single-direction baseline; Chinese-trained vectors transfer almost unchanged to English (and vice versa), indicating a language-agnostic refusal subspace.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, enabling controlled deployment of LLMs in security-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

*Binquan Guo,Junteng Cao,Marie Siew,Binbin Chen,Tony Q. S. Quek,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scheduling federated learning over LEO satellite networks with a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand framework to accelerate model exchange, achieving 14.2–41.5% round-time reductions; scalable with model size and client count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving distributed AI training in satellite networks is hampered by dynamic topology, bandwidth constraints, and inability to centralize data; need efficient scheduling to reduce training round duration.

Method: Discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically allocates communication resources for federated learning in satellite networks; contrasts with traditional statistical multiplexing; on-demand resource allocation speeds up model parameter exchange.

Result: Significant reductions in overall round times (14.20% to 41.48%) over baseline; acceleration increases with larger models and more clients, indicating scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses bottlenecks in FL over satellite networks and provides scalable, resource-aware scheduling to speed up federated training in dynamic, high-latency networks.

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

### [114] [TripOptimizer: Generative 3D Shape Optimization and Drag Prediction using Triplane VAE Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12224)
*Parsa Vatani,Mohamed Elrefaie,Farhad Nazarpour,Faez Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable deep learning framework (TripOptimizer) for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization from vehicle point clouds, using a variational autoencoder with a triplane implicit 3D representation and a drag-prediction head. It achieves up to 11.8% drag reduction and is robust to non-watertight meshes, validated by high-fidelity CFD; enables faster, data-driven design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFD-based aerodynamic optimization is computationally expensive and limits design space exploration. There is a need for fast, differentiable surrogates that can operate directly on raw geometry (point clouds) and handle imperfect meshes, capturing aerodynamically relevant features in a latent space to guide optimization.

Method: A variational autoencoder with a triplane-based implicit 3D representation reconstructs high-fidelity geometry from point clouds and includes a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on DrivAerNet++ (8,000 geometries) with CFD-derived drag labels. An optimization strategy selectively updates a subset of encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry toward a target drag value. Robust to non-watertight meshes; validated against high-fidelity CFD with >150M cells.

Result: Optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8%. Independent high-fidelity CFD validation confirms improvements. The implicit representation enhances robustness to geometric imperfections, enabling optimization without the strict watertightness constraints typical of traditional adjoint methods. The workflow reduces reliance on expensive CFD in early design stages.

Conclusion: TripOptimizer provides a differentiable, geometry-agnostic platform for aerodynamic shape optimization directly from point clouds, enabling rapid exploration of design space with reliable drag predictions and resilience to mesh imperfections, thereby accelerating early-stage aerodynamic design.

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

### [115] [A Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Based Model Predictive Control Framework for $SIR$ Epidemics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12226)
*Aiping Zhong,Baike She,Philip E. Paré*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an MPC-PINNs framework for SIR epidemic control to jointly estimate states and parameters from noisy observations under partial knowledge, with variants MPC-LS-PINNs and MPC-SI-PINNs, and extended to second knowledge assumption as MPC-S-PINNs; validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time joint state/parameter estimation under limited observability is critical for effective epidemic control; existing MPC approaches either learn parameters with known states or learn states with known parameters. This work addresses joint estimation within MPC using PINNs, under two knowledge scenarios.

Method: Develop MPC-PINNs integrated into MPC for SIR with control; propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs) to improve noise robustness; propose split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs) using integral operators and state coupling. Extend to second assumption by simplifying split PINNs to split PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs).

Result: Experimental results show effectiveness across settings, demonstrating capable joint estimation and control under noisy measurements.

Conclusion: PINN-based MPC framework enables simultaneous state and parameter estimation with optimal control for SIR models under partial information; the proposed variants improve robustness and reconstruction; adaptable to different prior knowledge scenarios.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A routing-based adaptive multitask/multimodal framework for per-sample processing in psychotherapy-like data, dynamically selecting modality pathways and task-sharing strategies to predict depression and anxiety, outperforming fixed baselines with interpretable routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity, partial missingness, and complex task interactions in healthcare, particularly in psychotherapy where structured assessments, unstructured notes, and correlations among outcomes pose challenges for conventional multitask models.

Method: A routing-based architecture with multiple modality paths (raw and fused text/numeric representations). For each input, the model routes through an expert combination, producing task-specific predictions via shared or independent heads as dictated by routing. End-to-end training.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic data and real psychotherapy notes shows consistent improvement over fixed multitask or single-task baselines. The learned routing policy yields interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure.

Conclusion: The framework enables per-subject adaptive information processing to handle data heterogeneity and task correlations in personalized healthcare, with potential to improve mental health outcomes, treatment assignment precision, and cost-effectiveness in psychotherapy.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

*MSR Avinash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning for Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct on an 8 GB RTX 4060, exploring batch size, sequence length, optimizer (AdamW vs PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs bf16); finds paged optimizers boost throughput by ~25%, bf16 is less efficient than fp16, and 2048-token sequences are feasible with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, providing reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the practical efficiency and feasibility of parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) on consumer GPUs with tight VRAM limits, an area with limited prior empirical data.

Method: Controlled profiling of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, using a single RTX 4060 across three configurations while varying batch size, sequence length, optimizer (AdamW vs PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs bf16); measured throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, VRAM usage, and estimated energy.

Result: Paged optimizers improved throughput by up to 25% (e.g., 628 tok/s vs. 500 tok/s baseline); bf16 reduced efficiency relative to fp16; sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible under 8 GB with parameter-efficient methods; this constitutes the first systematic consumer-GPU study with reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines.

Conclusion: Provides a pioneering, reproducible case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs and offers actionable guidelines for researchers/practitioners operating under strict hardware constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

### [118] [Flexible Multimodal Neuroimaging Fusion for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12234)
*Benjamin Burns,Yuan Xue,Douglas W. Scharre,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PerM-MoE improves multimodal AD progression prediction under missing modalities by using independent per-modality routers in a sparse MoE, outperforming Flex-MoE and unimodal baselines on ADNI data for 2-year CDR-SB change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical multimodal neuroimaging often has missing modalities; existing multimodal models struggle when modalities are absent, limiting clinical applicability. A flexible routing mechanism per modality could better leverage available data.

Method: Introduce PerM-MoE, a sparse mixture-of-experts with independent routers for each modality (instead of a single shared router). Evaluate on T1 MRI, FLAIR, amyloid PET, and tau PET from ADNI. Compare to Flex-MoE and unimodal models for predicting 2-year change in CDR-SB under varying modality missingness.

Result: PerM-MoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most modality-missingness scenarios and shows more effective use of experts than Flex-MoE.

Conclusion: PerM-MoE enhances robustness and predictive performance of multimodal models under high modality missingness, offering practical benefit for clinical deployment where complete modality data are often unavailable.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

*Hangzhan Jin,Sitao Luan,Sicheng Lyu,Guillaume Rabusseau,Reihaneh Rabbany,Doina Precup,Mohammad Hamdaqa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage SFT+RL's benefits arise from restoring rather than expanding OOD ability; OOD performance peaks early during SFT and later degrades (forgetting); RL mainly recovers lost OOD capabilities, not fundamental enhancements; recovery has bounds depending on SFT duration; changes in OOD behavior relate to rotations of singular vectors rather than singular values; findings challenge the simplistic memorization-generalization view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the mechanism behind the SFT+RL synergy in post-training of large language models and move beyond the oversimplified claim that 'SFT memorizes, RL generalizes'.

Method: Empirical analysis of OOD performance across stages of SFT and RL; singular value decomposition (SVD) of parameter matrices to link performance to matrix properties; manual edits of singular vectors to test causality; ablation-like checks.

Result: Observed early OOD forgetting during SFT; RL does not create fundamentally new OOD capability but helps recover lost OOD reasoning; Recovery is bounded by the duration of SFT; Singular values remain relatively stable; OOD behavior correlates with rotations of singular vectors rather than changes in singular values; provides a revised understanding of SFT and RL roles in two-stage fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The two-stage fine-tuning process works through a rotation of singular vectors that governs OOD behavior, not via gross changes in singular values. SFT should be timed and potentially guided to preserve or reorient these vectors, while RL serves mainly to restore forgotten OOD abilities. These insights challenge the traditional memorization-vs-generalization narrative and suggest new directions for optimizing SFT+RL pipelines.

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

### [120] [Neural Diffeomorphic-Neural Operator for Residual Stress-Induced Deformation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12237)
*Changqing Liu,Kaining Dai,Zhiwei Zhao,Tianyi Wu,Yingguang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffeomorphic-embedding neural operator (NDNO) that maps complex 3D geometries to a common reference domain for efficient residual-stress-induced deformation prediction, enabling rapid adaptation to varying geometries with high accuracy across diverse parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual stress-induced deformation depends on geometry; traditional simulation is costly and geometry-specific. Neural operators offer speed-ups but struggle with changing domains, so a geometry-invariant reference mapping could unlock efficient deformation prediction across diverse shapes.

Method: Introduce a diffeomorphic neural network to map each geometry to a common reference domain (enforcing smoothness and invertibility). Train a neural operator on this reference domain to learn deformation fields induced by residual stresses. At inference, new geometries are mapped to the reference domain, the operator predicts the deformation, and results are interpreted back onto the original geometry. The framework claims accuracy for main-direction and multi-direction deformation fields across diverse geometries.

Result: High accuracy and efficiency in predicting residual-stress–induced deformation across parts with varying geometries (types, dimensions, features). Capable of producing both single-directional and multi-directional deformation fields.

Conclusion: The proposed neural diffeomorphic embedding approach (NDNO) provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for deformation prediction in structural components with varying geometries, enabling rapid adaptation to geometric changes while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

*Songlin Zhou,Tao Zhou,Xin Li,Stephen Shing-Toung Yau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Follicular thyroid cancer is hard to diagnose preoperatively; this study uses enhanced data mining on 1673 nodal cases to uncover multiple malignant indicators beyond common ultrasound signs, including nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern, low TSH scores, and Hashimoto's association, suggesting a multi-indicator approach improves diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound features and preoperative diagnostic accuracy is limited. The study aims to uncover actionable clinical indications using advanced data mining inspired by SHAP to aid preoperative diagnosis.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 1673 nodal cases (2010–2023) from Peking University Third Hospital. The authors modify traditional association rule mining with new analytic metrics reflecting malignant associations between clinical indications and cancer, inspired by SHAP interpretability.

Result: Among 1414 benign and 259 malignant nodes, the study identifies strong malignant associations not only with common indicators (irregular/lobulated margins, uneven halo, hypoechogenicity) but also with nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern, and low TSH scores; Hashimoto's thyroiditis appears to have a strong malignant association when combined.

Conclusion: For preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected to be follicular thyroid cancer, integrating multiple clinical indications yields more accurate results. The identified malignant associations may guide clinicians and inform future diagnostic strategies.

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

TL;DR: InJecteD is a framework to interpret Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by tracking 2D point-cloud denoising trajectories, revealing phase-based dynamics, dataset-specific behavior, and benefits from Fourier embeddings for stability and reconstruction—the work emphasizes transparency and human–AI collaboration through trajectory-based metrics (Wasserstein distance, cosine similarity).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance interpretability of DDPMs in 2D point-cloud generation to debug, refine, and collaborate with AI systems by exposing the denoising dynamics and trajectory-level properties.

Method: Introduce InJecteD framework with customizable input/time embeddings; apply to a simplified DDPM across Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle datasets; quantify trajectory properties (displacement, velocity, clustering, drift field) using Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity; compare four model configurations with different embeddings and noise schedules, including Fourier-based embeddings; analyze denoising phases.

Result: Identified three denoising phases: noise exploration, rapid shape formation, final refinement; dataset-specific dynamics (bullseyes show concentric convergence; dinos show complex contour formation); Fourier embeddings improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality; framework supports debugging and refinement.

Conclusion: InJecteD enhances DDPM interpretability for 2D point-cloud generation, aiding human-AI collaboration and model debugging. Embedding choices, especially Fourier-based, influence trajectory stability and reconstruction; results point to actionable design choices and potential generalization to broader data modalities.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with

improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Motivation: To understand why JEPA yields meaningful representations and identify training strategies that enforce correct equivalence relations via an auxiliary task.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a simple JEPA variant with an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics; proof of No Unhealthy Representation Collapse; empirical validation in a counting environment.

Result: Proof that zero transition-consistency loss and zero auxiliary regression loss imply that non-equivalent observations map to distinct latent representations; joint training yields richer representations than separate training.

Conclusion: Incorporating an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations is a viable path to improve JEPA encoders for model-based RL and representation learning.

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

*Mihir Tare,Clemens Rattasits,Yiming Wu,Euan Wielewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphSAGE applied to non-bipartite heterogeneous banking transaction networks to produce scalable, inductive node embeddings that reveal interpretable clusters and enhance downstream money mule detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Banks need scalable, inductive graph representations that work on dynamic, real-world transaction networks and generalize to unseen nodes, overcoming transductive limits.

Method: Construct anonymised transaction network (customers, merchants). Train GraphSAGE to generate node embeddings on non-bipartite heterogeneous graphs. Analyze embeddings for interpretability (geographic/demographic alignment). Apply embeddings to a downstream money mule detection classifier to assess improvement in prioritising high-risk accounts.

Result: Embeddings reveal interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes. Improved prioritisation of high-risk accounts in money mule detection when using the embeddings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates inductive scalability and interpretability of GraphSAGE for large banking networks; provides a practical blueprint for applying graph ML to transactional ecosystems in finance.

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

*Jinmeiyang Wang,Jing Dong,Li Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MT-DQN is a unified model combining Transformer, TGNN, and DQN to improve short-video recommendations, outperforming Concat-Modal and Vanilla-DQN on key metrics, but with notable computational cost and latency concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In short-video platforms, predicting user behavior and optimizing recommendations requires modeling sequential actions, temporal graph relations, and policy optimization. Existing concatenation-based baselines may miss joint representations and temporal dependencies, motivating an integrated architecture.

Method: A joint architecture (MT-DQN) that fuses a Transformer for sequence modeling, a Temporal Graph Neural Network for temporal user-item relations, and a Deep Q-Network for reinforcement learning-based policy optimization. Evaluated against Concat-Modal and Vanilla-DQN on standard metrics.

Result: MT-DQN achieves higher performance: average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and average NDCG@5 improvement of 8.3% over Concat-Modal; compared to Vanilla-DQN, MSE is reduced by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. However, it incurs higher computational cost and sensitivity to online inference latency.

Conclusion: MT-DQN demonstrates strong performance gains in short-video recommendation tasks but faces deployment challenges due to computational demands. Future work should focus on architectural optimization to reduce cost and latency while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes the MT-DQN model, which integrates a Transformer,
Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to address the

outperforms traditional concatenated models, such as Concat-Modal, achieving an
average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and an average NDCG@5 improvement of
8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN
reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize

*Jiyong Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic ML framework for transformer attention: modeling Q/K/V as Gaussian sequences with time-varying variance and using maximum likelihood to estimate the value vector, offering a potential explanation for the softmax/scaled dot-product and linking to maximum entropy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical, probabilistic grounding for the attention mechanism in transformers and to explain the softmax/scaling behavior, possibly via a maximum entropy perspective.

Method: Model the sequence of value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian distributions; the variance depends on time step, the key, and the query; the mean depends on the time step and the corresponding value vector; apply maximum likelihood estimation to determine the value vector; discuss connections to scaled dot-product attention and maximum entropy models.

Result: The abstract outlines a theoretical framework without reported empirical results; it proposes probabilistic explanations for attention and invites further validation and exploration.

Conclusion: Offers a novel probabilistic interpretation of attention in transformer architectures and suggests future work to relate the model to the scaling in softmax and to maximum entropy formulations.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial markets are volatile and complex; quantum generative models can potentially better capture intricate distributions and speed up training.

Method: Developed a QGAN tailored for stock price prediction; trained on historical stock index data; used AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the quantum circuits; compared against LSTM and classical GAN baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a viable step toward integrating quantum computing in financial forecasting with potential speed and precision advantages; holds implications for traders, analysts, and researchers.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Quantum Generative Adversarial
Networks (QGANs) for stock price prediction. Financial markets are inherently
complex, marked by high volatility and intricate patterns that traditional
models often fail to capture. QGANs, leveraging the power of quantum computing,
offer a novel approach by combining the strengths of generative models with
quantum machine learning techniques. We implement a QGAN model tailored for
stock price prediction and evaluate its performance using historical stock
market data. Our results demonstrate that QGANs can generate synthetic data
closely resembling actual market behavior, leading to enhanced prediction
accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The
quantum-enhanced model outperforms classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
GAN models in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy. This research
represents a key step toward integrating quantum computing in financial
forecasting, offering potential advantages in speed and precision over
traditional methods. The findings suggest important implications for traders,
financial analysts, and researchers seeking advanced tools for market analysis.

*Yuting Liu,Qiang Zhou,Hanzhe Li,Chenqi Gong,Jingjing Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes C3DE, a dual-path NCDE with a causal correction mechanism to model long-term crowd flow by integrating POIs, reducing sampling errors and spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term crowd flow predictions suffer from cumulative sampling errors due to longer sequences; POIs evolve asynchronously with flow and can create spurious causal links. A method that handles multi-timescale dynamics and causal effects is needed.

Method: A dual-path Neural Controlled Differential Equation backbone captures asynchronous evolution of crowd flow and POI distributions across multiple time scales. A dynamic correction mechanism uses a counterfactual-based causal effect estimator to quantify and mitigate POI-induced spurious causality. A predictor fuses POI and flow signals for long-term forecasting.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show superior performance of C3DE, especially in cities with notable flow fluctuations, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: C3DE effectively models long-term crowd flow dynamics while mitigating accumulation of errors and spurious causal effects, enabling more accurate long-term predictions.

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

*Michael Freedman,Michael Mulligan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Emergent KA geometry in vanilla single-hidden-layer nets during standard training; quantified via Jacobian exterior powers; links function complexity and hyperparameters; suggests intervention to accelerate learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how neural networks organically shape inputs for downstream processing and how KA geometry emerges, with aim to leverage this structure to improve learning via hyperparameter interventions.

Method: Compute the Jacobian J(x) of the first-layer map across data, analyze exterior powers of J(x), and extract statistics (e.g., number of zero rows, minor statistics) to quantify texture/KA geometry; perform empirical study across training of shallow MLPs and varying hyperparameters.

Result: KA geometry often emerges in training of vanilla single-hidden-layer networks; provides rough mapping of where KA-like geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and hyperparameters.

Conclusion: KA geometry can arise without explicit engineering, offering insight into data preparation learned by networks and informing hyperparameter choices to potentially accelerate learning; connects to KA-Networks as an emergent counterpart.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

*Xianchen Liu,Tianhui Zhang,Xinyu Zhang,Lingmin Hou,Zhen Guo,Yuanhao Tian,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrates LSTM-attention forecasting with PSO-based optimization for dynamic pricing and replenishment of perishable fresh foods to maximize profit and reduce waste.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fresh-food retailers face perishability, uncertain demand, and waste. A unified predictive-optimization approach is needed to dynamically price and stock perishable goods.

Method: An LSTM model with attention predicts seven-day forecasts of sales, pricing trends, and spoilage; these forecasts feed a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) routine that optimizes pricing and replenishment under inventory constraints, using cost-plus pricing to reflect fixed and variable costs.

Result: The framework aims to maximize profitability while reducing waste, with the attention mechanism improving interpretability of the forecast and decision factors; scalable to other perishable-good contexts.

Conclusion: Bridging predictive modeling and optimization, the approach provides a dynamic, adaptable pricing and inventory management solution for fresh-food retail and similar industries.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fourier-embedded trunk networks (FEDONet) improve DeepONet by incorporating random Fourier feature mappings into the trunk, enabling richer spatial representations and significantly boosting PDE surrogate performance (2–3x in relative L2 error) across diverse PDE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DeepONet trunks rely on fully connected linear layers, which can struggle to capture complex spatial patterns in PDE solutions. There is a need to enhance spatial representation to improve neural operator learning and surrogate modeling for PDEs.

Method: Introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks (FEDONet) by applying random Fourier feature mappings to the trunk inputs, enriching spatial representation within the DeepONet architecture. Evaluate on a broad suite of PDE datasets (2D Poisson, Burgers', Lorenz-63, Eikonal, Allen–Cahn, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, Lorenz-96).

Result: FEDONet consistently yields substantial improvements over baseline DeepONet in terms of solution reconstruction accuracy, with average relative L2 errors reduced by about 2–3× across the tested PDE benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fourier embeddings effectively enhance neural operator learning, offering a robust, broadly applicable approach for PDE surrogate modeling within the DeepONet framework.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

TL;DR: Partitioned-LDA with shrinkage, paired with PCA, effectively reduces high-dimensional word embeddings for tabular salary classification with limited data, achieving top-10 on the leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional word embeddings in tabular data classification suffer from small sample sizes; dimensionality reduction is underexplored for this setting, especially using PCA and LDA.

Method: Evaluate PCA and LDA as linear reduction methods for 300-d embeddings in tabular data. Address LDA's covariance estimation issues with shrinkage; propose Partitioned-LDA that splits embeddings into equal blocks and applies LDA per block; compare with regular LDA and PCA.

Result: PCA with an appropriate subspace improves over raw embeddings; regular LDA struggles due to covariance estimation; shrinkage regularization greatly improves LDA performance even with two dimensions; Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, with shrinkage, reaches top-10 on the public leaderboard.

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA with shrinkage is effective for leveraging word embeddings in high-dimensional, tabular-data classification with limited training samples; a practical approach to boosting performance in such settings.

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

*Hong Sun,Joshua A. Vita,Amit Samanta,Vincenzo Lordi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MEAGraph, an unsupervised method using a multi-kernel edge-attention graph autoencoder to cluster atomic environments and prune biased datasets without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating chemically diverse and unbiased datasets for force-field training is challenging because common sampling techniques oversample regions of the potential energy surface (PES) and clustering in high-dimensional descriptors can miss distinct PES regions, leading to biased datasets.

Method: MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations (multi-kernel) with attention-based message passing in a graph autoencoder to capture geometric sensitivity and enable unsupervised clustering and pruning without supervision or extensive training.

Result: MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, enabling straightforward pruning to remove sampling bias; demonstrated on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets; supports representation learning, clustering, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective, unsupervised tool for analysis and cleaning of atomic datasets, potentially improving dataset diversity and the generalizability of force fields by enabling bias-aware pruning and data-driven clustering.

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Farmers’ data privacy concerns and the need for scalable, data-driven crop disease detection tailored to Minnesota’s environment and operations.

Method: Proposes data collection from Minnesota farms, locally trained deep learning models, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server to refine models via federated learning; aims for higher accuracy, good generalization, lower communication/training costs, and early disease intervention; outlines steps for empirical validation.

Result: No empirical results are provided; the paper outlines methodology and expected outcomes, including improved disease detection accuracy, better generalization, reduced costs, and earlier intervention once validated.

Conclusion: A privacy-conscious framework that bridges advanced ML with practical needs of Minnesota farmers, setting the stage for secure, scalable disease detection in smart farming and future empirical validation.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

*Konstantinos Vasili,Zachery T. Dahm,Stylianos Chatzidakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised LSTM autoencoder with dual attention detects and localizes anomalies in reactor radiation monitoring, providing sensor-level anomaly localization and timing within a single network, validated on PUR-1 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclear reactors generate multivariate time-series data from new, potentially smaller and more autonomous designs. Real-time monitoring and safety-critical anomaly detection require interpretable, data-efficient methods, but real-world data are scarce and abnormal events are rare, complicating benchmarking.

Method: An unsupervised LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism operates over multivariate time-series data. Feature attention weights sensors with abnormal patterns; temporal attention highlights when irregularities occur. The model outputs both detection and localization (which sensors and when). Evaluated on real-world PUR-1 reactor data with increasing complexity.

Result: The framework enables identifying affected sensors and the duration of anomalies within a single network, offering interpretable localization via attention weights and unified detection/localization.

Conclusion: This approach advances interpretable anomaly diagnostics in nuclear monitoring and addresses explainability and benchmarking challenges, demonstrating feasibility on real-world data. Practical deployment may still depend on data availability and diversity of abnormal events.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

*Julian Ripper,Ousama Esbel,Rafael Fietzek,Max Mühlhäuser,Thomas Kreutz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDPM-based hybrid model for automotive time-series synthesizes realistic data from small, potentially corrupted CAN datasets; improves data quality via imputation and outperforms in physical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle small time-series datasets with corrupted samples by generating synthetic, physically plausible data to enable effective training and data cleaning.

Method: Apply denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to long-term vehicle CAN data using a hybrid autoregressive/non-autoregressive architecture; compare two DDPM time-series variants and propose practical improvements; develop three metrics to assess physical correctness and track adherence.

Result: The best model yields samples with better physical correctness than the training data, shows plausible driving behavior, and can be used to impute and correct physically implausible regions in the dataset, improving overall data quality.

Conclusion: DDPM-based generative modeling can produce high-quality, physically coherent automotive time-series from limited data and can aid data augmentation and cleaning for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

### [139] [Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML): Inducing Causal World Models for Few-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12387)
*Mohamed Zayaan S*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSML learns latent causal structure through perception-to-symbols, differentiable causal induction, and graph reasoning, enabling rapid, few-shot causal generalization and counterfactuals; outperforms baselines on a physics-based CausalWorld benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliance of deep learning on spurious correlations and data-hungry training; advance towards human-like, robust, sample-efficient learning by inferring causal mechanisms.

Method: Perception module maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic representations; differentiable causal induction discovers the underlying causal graph among symbols; graph-based reasoning uses the graph to make predictions. Meta-learns a shared causal world model across a distribution of tasks, enabling rapid adaptation to novel tasks (including interventions and counterfactuals) from few examples. Introduces CausalWorld, a physics-based benchmark to assess causal reasoning capabilities.

Result: CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks that require true causal inference, and demonstrates rapid adaptation with limited data across tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating causal discovery with meta-learning yields a robust, sample-efficient framework for causal reasoning. The CausalWorld benchmark provides a testbed for true causal inference in AI and highlights the benefits of a shared causal world model for rapid generalization.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

*Janik Henn,Adrian Hauptmannl,Hamza A. A. Gardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI-assisted pre-printability check that flags problematic 3D-model features to prevent print failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Democratize 3D printing by helping novices anticipate issues before printing; reduce failures caused by geometry.

Method: Train an AI model on 3D-model features to predict print-failure risk due to difficult geometries, and integrate this pre-print check into the workflow before slicing.

Result: Not reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: If effective, this approach could lower failure rates and improve the user experience for non-expert users.

Abstract: 3D printing has long been a technology for industry professionals and
enthusiasts willing to tinker or even build their own machines. This stands in
stark contrast to today's market, where recent developments have prioritized
ease of use to attract a broader audience. Slicing software nowadays has a few
ways to sanity check the input file as well as the output gcode. Our approach
introduces a novel layer of support by training an AI model to detect common
issues in 3D models. The goal is to assist less experienced users by
identifying features that are likely to cause print failures due to difficult
to print geometries before printing even begins.

### [141] [Adaptive Spatial Goodness Encoding: Advancing and Scaling Forward-Forward Learning Without Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12394)
*Qingchun Gong,Robert Bogdan Staszewski,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Spatial Goodness Encoding (ASGE) is a FF-based CNN training framework that uses spatially-aware goodness representations to enable layer-wise supervision, decoupling classification from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing channel explosion and achieving competitive BP-free performance, including ImageNet results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation (BP) is powerful but computationally intensive, and previous FF-based methods for CNNs suffer from limited representational capacity and poor scalability due to exploding channel dimensionality. A scalable BP-free alternative is needed.

Method: ASGE computes spatially-aware goodness representations from feature maps at each layer to supervise learning in a layer-wise fashion. This decouples classification complexity from channel dimensionality, mitigating channel explosion and enabling scalable FF-based CNN training.

Result: ASGE outperforms other FF-based approaches on MNIST (99.65%), FashionMNIST (93.41%), CIFAR-10 (90.62%), CIFAR-100 (65.42%), and achieves first successful ImageNet FF-based training with Top-1 26.21% and Top-5 47.49%.

Conclusion: ASGE establishes a scalable, BP-free CNN training framework with competitive performance to BP-trained models and narrows the gap toward practical BP-free CNN training.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

### [142] [Bayesian Parametric Matrix Models: Principled Uncertainty Quantification for Spectral Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12406)
*Mohammad Nooraiepour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs) extend spectral PMMs to provide calibrated uncertainty estimates while preserving spectral structure and efficiency; they introduce adaptive spectral decomposition with perturbed eigenvalue bounds, manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors under Hermitian constraints, and finite-sample calibration guarantees tied to spectral gaps and conditioning, achieving strong uncertainty calibration (ECE < 0.05) up to 500x500, with graceful degradation under ill-conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral learning methods in scientific ML currently offer only point estimates, lacking uncertainty quantification, which is problematic for safety-critical applications. Although parametric matrix models are powerful, they are deterministic. There is a need for principled Bayesian approaches that quantify uncertainty without destroying spectral structure or computational efficiency.

Method: Introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models (B-PMMs) that enforce spectral structure. Develop adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized matrix perturbation bounds to propagate eigenvalue uncertainty. Use structured variational inference with matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors constrained to Hermitian (spectral) structure. Provide finite-sample calibration guarantees that explicitly depend on spectral gaps and problem conditioning.

Result: Empirical validation across matrix sizes from 5x5 to 500x500 shows perfect convergence rates and exceptional uncertainty calibration with expected calibration error (ECE) < 0.05, while maintaining favorable computational scaling. The approach degrades gracefully under ill-conditioning and yields reliable uncertainty estimates even in near-degenerate regimes.

Conclusion: B-PMMs enable robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains by delivering calibrated uncertainty estimates without sacrificing spectral integrity or efficiency, and pave the way for broader adoption of Bayesian approaches in spectral machine learning.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

### [143] [Surrogate Representation Inference for Noisy Text and Image Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12416)
*Kentaro Nakamura*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SRI introduces a neural-network-based surrogate representation that mediates the link between human annotations and structured outcomes, reducing standard errors and enabling valid inference even with annotation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address large standard errors and the need for error-free human annotations in downstream analyses that rely on ML on unstructured data.

Method: Learn a low-dimensional latent representation of unstructured data via a neural network. The surrogate assumption holds by design when coders rely solely on unstructured data. With multiple annotations, SRI also corrects non-differential measurement errors. Theoretical identification and semiparametric efficient estimation are developed for text-as-outcome settings.

Result: Simulation studies and a real-world application show >50% reduction in standard errors when ML accuracy is moderate, with valid inference even when annotations contain non-differential measurement errors.

Conclusion: SRI provides a practical, theoretically grounded framework for efficient inference in contexts with unstructured data-driven annotations, leveraging a surrogate latent representation and accommodating annotation errors.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

### [144] [On the Regularity and Fairness of Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12457)
*Xiaoyi Wu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A combinatorial multi-armed bandit algorithm that achieves fairness and reward regularity in addition to maximizing cumulative rewards. It uses a hybrid weight that linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (fairness), Time-Since-Last-Reward (reward regularity), and Upper Confidence Bounds (exploration). Lyapunov-based analysis yields zero cumulative fairness violation and reward regularity with bounded regret, validated on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In wireless networks, guaranteeing fairness among arms and regular reward delivery is as important as maximizing total rewards; hence there is a need for learning policies that ensure these constraints in a combinatorial MAB setting.

Method: Propose a parameterized regular-and-fair learning algorithm that weights arms by a linear combination of virtual queue-lengths, TSLR, and UCB estimates; uses Lyapunov drift analysis with a non-trivial Lyapunov function to derive performance guarantees; explores the relationship between queues and TSLR to characterize performance.

Result: Analytical guarantees: zero cumulative fairness violation, reward regularity, and bounded cumulative regret. Empirical validation via simulations on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The algorithm successfully achieves fairness, reward regularity, and low regret in combinatorial MAB settings and shows promising applicability to wireless networks; results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid weighting and Lyapunov-based analysis.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

### [145] [Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernels via Parameter-Space Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12467)
*Sriram Nagaraj,Vishakh Hari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) by replacing local gradients with nonlocal interaction-based approximations in parameter space, enabling NTK analysis for nonsmooth functions and broader models; explores fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations with numerical demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NTK theory relies on gradient differentiability in parameters, which excludes many nonsmooth target functions, stochastic estimators, and broader model classes. A nonlocal gradient can extend NTK to a wider class of functions.

Method: Define a nonlocal gradient operator in parameter space and formulate the Nonlocal NTK (NNTK). Develop both fixed-kernel and attention-based variants of the nonlocal operator, derive the corresponding kernel framework, and validate through numerical experiments.

Result: Numerical studies illustrate the NNTK formulation and demonstrate its potential to extend NTK analysis to nonsmooth regimes and broader model classes.

Conclusion: The NNTK provides a pathway to extend NTK theory to nonsmooth and non-differentiable settings, with practical fixed-kernel and attention-based variants; further theoretical and empirical work is suggested.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

*Oscar Rincón-Cardeno,Gregorio Pérez Bernal,Silvana Montoya Noguera,Nicolás Guarín-Zapata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs and BEM are directly compared for the 2D Helmholtz wave-scattering problem. BEM trains faster and, at comparable accuracy, is more efficient overall; PINNs require longer training but can offer very fast inference and consistent results, though generalization outside the training region degrades relative to BEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a direct, quantitative comparison between Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) for the Helmholtz equation in wave scattering, guiding method selection under the same conditions.

Method: Solve the same scattering problem with BEM (boundary discretization) and PINNs (PDE and boundary residual minimization, with hyperparameter optimization). Compare solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization. Vary BEM integration points and PINN architecture (layers/neurons).

Result: PINNs achieve consistent solutions at comparable accuracy but require about 42× longer training time than BEM; once trained, PINNs can be up to 204× faster at evaluation. Generalization beyond the training domain shows PINNs’ relative error increasing (from 7.46×10^-2 to 8.22), whereas BEM maintains a similar error level in the extended region.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative trade-offs between PINNs and BEM for the Helmholtz equation, informing method choice for wave propagation problems and highlighting directions for improving PINN training efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

*Ruimeng Hu,Jihao Long,Haosheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), a graph-guided, fixed-component neural architecture for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games on graphs, achieving sparse, interpretable models with competitive performance and improved efficiency via NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle large-scale, graph-structured multi-agent SDGs under uncertainty with interpretable and efficient models, reducing trainable parameters while preserving expressive power.

Method: Introduce NTM: a feedforward network with fixed, non-trainable graph-aligned components that enforce sparsification; prove universal approximation for static graph games; validate expressivity; integrate NTM into Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE to create sparse variants (NTM-DP, NTM-DBSDE); evaluate on multiple SDG benchmarks.

Result: NTM is theoretically universal for static graph games; empirically matches fully trainable solvers in accuracy while reducing trainable parameters and computation; NTM variants perform well across three SDGs with different graph structures, showing robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: NTM provides a principled route to scalable, interpretable Nash equilibrium computation in graph-based SDGs, enabling efficient, robust, and competitive solvers with substantially fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

*Alessandro Crimi,Andrea Brovelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models can forecast fMRI time-series in zero-shot and fine-tuned modes and yield Granger-like causal estimates that may outperform classic Granger in detecting causal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether foundation models offer competitive forecasting and causal discovery for brain signals compared with Wiener-Granger causality, and evaluate zero-shot applicability.

Method: Evaluate on human fMRI data (controls vs patients). Measure forecasting error (zero-shot and fine-tuned). Derive Granger-like causality estimates from the model and compare to standard Granger causality. Validate using synthetic time series from logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.

Result: Zero-shot MAE: 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients. Foundation model showed competitive forecasting; no clear quantitative difference in Granger causality between models, but foundation model detected causal interactions more precisely.

Conclusion: Foundation models provide versatility and strong zero-shot performance for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series, with potential utility for neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

### [149] [Phi: Preference Hijacking in Multi-modal Large Language Models at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12521)
*Yifan Lan,Yuanpu Cao,Weitong Zhang,Lu Lin,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A vulnerability in Multimodal LLMs where an attacker can steer model outputs at inference time using a transferable, universal hijacking perturbation embedded in images, without modifying the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As MLLMs become widely deployed, there is a safety risk that responses can be subtly biased or steered by crafted inputs. The work identifies a new attack that targets output preferences rather than producing harmful content, highlighting a security gap in current MLLMs.

Method: Introduce Preference Hijacking (Phi), a method to manipulate MLLM response preferences with a hijacked image at inference time without model changes. It includes a universal hijacking perturbation that can be embedded in different images to steer responses toward attacker-specified preferences; demonstrates transferability across tasks and inputs.

Result: The approach effectively hijacks MLLM preferences across various tasks, and the hijacking perturbation is transferable between images, indicating a practical and generalizable threat. The authors provide code for replication.

Conclusion: This work reveals a new, subtle safety risk in MLLMs—preference manipulation via image perturbations—calling for defenses, robust evaluation, and possible mitigations to ensure reliable and safe model behavior.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce plausible but incorrect outputs; existing heuristics lack formal guarantees. There is a need for verifiable, robust abstention strategies with theoretical certificates.

Method: Develop a PAC-Bayes sub-Gamma analysis that extends beyond standard Bernstein bounds; derive skeleton sensitivity theorems for robustness to misspecification; provide failure-mode guarantees under assumption violations; introduce a variational method to construct skeletons; validate assumptions empirically across six datasets and multiple model families; report abstention improvements and runtime costs, with batching optimizations.

Result: Empirically validate the framework across six datasets; reduce abstention by 12–15% at the same risk; keep runtime overhead below 20% (further reduced via batching).

Conclusion: Presents the first comprehensive theory of information-lift certificates for selective classification, with a practical skeleton-construction method and demonstrated improvements in abstention efficiency at modest computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models often produce plausible but incorrect outputs. Existing
heuristics such as HallBayes lack formal guarantees. We develop the first
comprehensive theory of \emph{information-lift certificates} under selective
classification. Our contributions are: (i) a PAC-Bayes \emph{sub-gamma}
analysis extending beyond standard Bernstein bounds; (ii) explicit skeleton
sensitivity theorems quantifying robustness to misspecification; (iii)
failure-mode guarantees under assumption violations; and (iv) a principled
variational method for skeleton construction. Across six datasets and multiple
model families, we validate assumptions empirically, reduce abstention by
12--15\% at the same risk, and maintain runtime overhead below 20\% (further
reduced via batching).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAPHITE transforms a heterophilic graph by adding feature nodes to foster homophilic message passing, directly increasing graph homophily with modest size growth; yields strong gains on heterophilic graphs and competitive results on homophilic ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterophily undermines GNNs, and many methods focus on architecture rather than addressing the root cause. A direct, transformation-based approach to increase homophily could unlock better performance on heterophilic graphs.

Method: Introduce feature nodes that connect to original nodes sharing similar features, creating a transformed graph that promotes homophilic messaging. Grounded in the exact definition of homophily, the method increases graph homophily with only a small increase in graph size. The authors provide theoretical and empirical validation of increased homophily and performance.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic datasets and matches performance of SOTA on homophilic datasets.

Conclusion: Direct graph transformation to boost homophily is a viable and first-of-its-kind strategy to tackle heterophily, with GRAPHITE offering a simple yet effective framework.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

*Wei Li,Zheze Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cross-modal deep metric learning approach for fast, sensitive time-series anomaly detection using clustering, principal component direction vectors, and von Mises–Fisher directional modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent issues of low sensitivity and high time consumption in time-series anomaly detection by leveraging cross-modal deep metric learning, clustering in feature space, and directional statistics.

Method: Construct a cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model (input layer, triplet selection layer, loss computation layer). Compute squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers; optimize with stochastic gradient descent; use the inner product of principal component direction vectors as the anomaly score. Apply von Mises–Fisher distribution to describe directional characteristics of time-series data; train evaluation parameters with historical data; detect anomalies by comparing the current principal component direction vector to a threshold.

Result: The method achieves high anomaly detection sensitivity and accuracy, fast detection speed, strong robustness, and accurate classification of time-series data with varying attributes.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal deep metric learning framework, combined with directional statistics via vMF modeling, effectively enhances time-series anomaly detection in terms of sensitivity, speed, and robustness.

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

TL;DR: Implements implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD) to extract interpretable latent structure from logits via Gram matrices of decoupled local logit representations, improving fine-grained classification without labels or feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit KD is simple but lacks interpretability. iCD aims to mine and transfer interpretable structural knowledge encoded in logits without relying on ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment.

Method: Compute Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to capture latent semantic structures; transfer this information to student models; compatible with diverse teacher–student architectures and does not require ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show effectiveness across architectures, with notable gains in fine-grained classification, achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline.

Conclusion: iCD offers a simple, effective way to enhance interpretability in knowledge distillation by transferring latent semantic structure via Gram-based logit interactions; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

*Tim Bary,Benoît Macq,Louis Petit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free, model- and expert-agnostic conformal-prediction framework for expert deferral that achieves high accuracy and reduces expert workload without retraining, outperforming both the base model and the best expert on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: L2D methods require retraining when expert composition or availability changes; current systems struggle to maintain reliability across inputs. A retraining-free, robust deferral mechanism is needed for scalable human-AI collaboration.

Method: Leverage the conformal predictor's prediction set to identify label-specific uncertainty; apply a segregativity criterion to measure how well an expert distinguishes among remaining plausible labels; select the most discriminative expert. The approach is training-free and model- and expert-agnostic.

Result: Empirical results show the method outperforms the standalone model and the strongest expert on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H, achieving accuracies of 99.57±0.10% and 99.40±0.52%, respectively, while reducing expert workload by up to 11x. The method remains robust under degraded expert performance and exhibits a gradual performance drop in low-information settings.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, retraining-free alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration, balancing high accuracy with reduced reliance on expert input.

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Junwei Deng,Juhan Bae,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic study of training data attribution (TDA) under access and resource constraints; shows proxy models and non-finetuned models can yield informative attributions, enabling feasible TDA in real-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDA is valuable but practical deployment is hindered by restricted model access and high computation; need guidance for feasible, resource-aware attribution.

Method: Survey and experimentation across varying access levels using proxy models; test attribution scores from models with and without prior training on the target data.

Result: Attribution scores from models without prior training remain informative across multiple tasks; proxy-model approaches enable feasible TDA under limited resources.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments with limited access and resources, improving feasibility and efficiency.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

TL;DR: MICE is a multimodal foundation model that integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data via diverse experts to improve pan-cancer prognosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI models struggle to leverage heterogeneous multimodal data and generalize across cancers; there is a need for scalable foundation models that capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.

Method: MICE uses multiple functionally diverse experts to collaboratively integrate multimodal data (pathology, clinical reports, genomics) for pan-cancer prognosis. It leverages data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types and combines contrastive and supervised learning to enhance generalizability and data efficiency.

Result: MICE outperforms unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert multimodal models, with C-index gains of 3.8%–11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8%–8.8% on independent cohorts, demonstrating strong generalizability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: MICE provides an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis prediction and shows potential for personalizing tailored therapies and improving treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

### [157] [High-Energy Concentration for Federated Learning in Frequency Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12630)
*Haozhi Shi,Weiying Xie,Hangyu Ye,Daixun Li,Jitao Ma,Leyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedFD proposes a frequency-domain FL method that preserves low-frequency components via a DCT-based binary mask to reduce communication and noise, while maintaining or improving accuracy through synthetic-data loss; shows strong gains on five image/speech datasets, including a CIFAR-10 example with substantial communication-cost reduction (37.78%) and 10.88% accuracy gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce redundant information and noise in spatial-domain FL, mitigate data heterogeneity, and lower communication costs while protecting privacy by using dataset distillation with synthetic data.

Method: A frequency-domain aware FL approach (FedFD) using discrete cosine transform to identify high-energy regions; applies a binary mask to keep low-frequency components, aligning frequency-domain distributions; incorporates real-data-driven synthetic classification loss to enhance low-frequency quality; optimizes in the frequency domain for efficiency; evaluated on five image and speech datasets.

Result: FedFD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets, achieving significant communication-cost reductions (e.g., CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet alpha=0.01 shows 37.78% reduction) and a 10.88% performance gain.

Conclusion: Preserving low-frequency information via frequency-domain distribution alignment reduces communication burden while improving FL performance, illustrating the effectiveness of high-energy concentration-based masking and synthetic data penalties for privacy-preserving distributed learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

### [158] [Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650)
*Chan Sik Han,Keon Myung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRep uses intermediate-layer representations from pre-trained time series foundation models for anomaly detection, building a compact reference set via core-set and online adaptation to concept drift, achieving superior performance on the UCR Anomaly Archive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relying on final-layer representations and task-specific heads may discard rich intermediate information; leveraging intermediate representations can yield more informative anomaly scores and improve robustness to distribution shifts.

Method: Select the most informative intermediate layer and patch-token position from a pre-trained TSFM; construct a training reference collection of intermediate representations; apply a core-set strategy to reduce size while preserving distributional coverage; compute anomaly scores as distances to the collection; at inference time, adapt by adding non-redundant representations from incoming data to handle concept drift.

Result: TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines (non-DL, DL, and foundation-model-based methods) on the UCR Anomaly Archive (250 univariate time series).

Conclusion: Using intermediate representations with a core-set reference and online adaptation yields robust anomaly detection that surpasses existing methods, demonstrating the value of leveraging TSFM internals for anomaly scoring.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

### [159] [Instance-level Randomization: Toward More Stable LLM Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12678)
*Yiyang Li,Yonghuang Wu,Ying Luo,Liangtai Sun,Zishu Qin,Lin Qiu,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes instance-level randomization (ILR) to stabilize LLM evaluations by randomizing evaluation factors per instance, reducing variance and unfairness, with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM evaluations suffer from instability due to random factors (e.g., few-shot prompts). Different models may prefer different random settings, leading to unfair comparisons. A robust benchmark should mitigate these variances.

Method: The authors analyze variance sources theoretically and introduce ILR: for each instance, randomize all factors affecting scores, run multiple experiments, and average results instead of fixing a single setting across the benchmark.

Result: Theoretically and empirically, ILR reduces variance and unfairness in comparisons and achieves similar robustness with less than half the computational cost compared with previous methods.

Conclusion: ILR provides more reliable and fair LLM evaluations while improving efficiency; it suggests evaluating each instance under randomized factors and averaging to obtain stable scores.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

### [160] [Large Language Model Scaling Laws for Neural Quantum States in Quantum Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12679)
*Oliver Knitter,Dan Zhao,Stefan Leichenauer,Shravan Veerapaneni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies scaling laws for transformer-based neural quantum states (NQS) in quantum chemistry, showing how performance metrics (abs. error, V-score) scale with problem size; finds that model-size vs. training-time trade-offs depend on loss metric and ansatz and do not follow the linear trend seen in LLM scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how NQS with LLM-based components scale in practice, enabling better predictions of performance and resource needs for quantum chemistry tasks.

Method: Derives parametric scaling laws predicting performance as a function of problem size for transformer-based NQS. Conducts compute-constrained optimization of these curves to examine how model size relates to training time, and compares across loss metrics and ansatz configurations.

Result: Scaling laws quantitatively relate performance (absolute error, V-score) to problem size for transformer-based NQS. The relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on the chosen loss metric and ansatz and does not follow the approximate linear scaling observed in language models.

Conclusion: NQS with LLM-inspired components exhibit scaling behavior that diverges from LLMs in several respects. Resource-performance trade-offs are metric- and ansatz-dependent, underscoring the need for metric-aware optimization when sizing NQS for quantum chemistry tasks.

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

### [161] [ZTree: A Subgroup Identification Based Decision Tree Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12688)
*Eric Cheng,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTree replaces impurity-based CART splits with hypothesis-testing for subgroup identification, using cross-validated stopping and a single z-threshold to control tree complexity; yields simpler trees with strong performance, especially in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a statistically principled, interpretable, and data-efficient alternative to traditional impurity-based splitting, addressing multiple testing concerns and pruning complexity.

Method: At each node, perform statistical tests (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to identify whether a candidate subgroup meaningfully differs from the complement. Use a cross-validation-based stopping rule to decide if further splitting is needed. The z-threshold acts as a p-value-like parameter for complexity control; once learned with a lenient threshold, simpler trees can be obtained by removing nodes that fail stricter thresholds. The framework can accommodate different tests via the common z-threshold.

Result: Empirical evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets shows strong performance, particularly in low-data regimes; ZTree tends to produce simpler trees than CART without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: ZTree offers a statistically grounded alternative to traditional CART splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and cross-validation to address multiple testing, yielding an efficient and flexible framework for decision tree learning.

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

*Jiadong Hong,Lei Liu,Xinyu Bian,Wenjie Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Soft Graph Transformer (SGT) for MIMO detection integrates graph-aware attention with message-passing and soft-input embeddings to enable soft-output, decoder-informed updates. It provides near-ML performance as a standalone detector and outperforms prior Transformer detectors while remaining computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the prohibitive complexity of ML detection in MIMO systems and the limitations of conventional message passing that rely on large-system/random matrix assumptions; and to enable decoder-informed soft outputs in Transformer-based detectors for iterative detection-decoding (IDD).

Method: Embed graph-structured message passing into a transformer attention mechanism and allow soft-input embeddings from decoders; design of a Soft-Input-Soft-Output (SISO) framework within a graph-aware Transformer for MIMO detection.

Result: Standalone detector performance that closely approaches ML detection and superior to prior Transformer-based detectors; effective generation of soft outputs and compatibility with IDD due to decoder-informed updates.

Conclusion: SGT successfully marries graph-aware diffusion of information with attention-based processing, achieving high accuracy with efficiency and enabling soft-output and decoder-informed updates essential for practical MIMO IDD systems.

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

*Yiyuan Yang,Guodong Long,Qinghua Lu,Liming Zhu,Jing Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bi-level personalization for federated foundation-model fine-tuning: client-level personalization via private data plus server-level group-aware aggregation using similar users, mitigating non-IID disturbances; validated on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated foundation models face a tension between personalization and federation, especially when data per user is limited and non-IID. A method is needed to tailor models to new users while leveraging shared information.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) client-level personalized fine-tuning using each client's private data; (2) server-level personalized aggregation by grouping similar clients (measured via client-specific task vectors) to enable group-wise personalization and reduce interference from irrelevant/non-IID clients.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-level personalization framework in achieving better personalization and robustness under non-IID settings.

Conclusion: The bi-level personalization framework provides a practical and effective way to balance personalization and federation in federated fine-tuning of foundation models, enabling improved adaptation for new users and specialized tasks.

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: Early CKD detection is hard in outpatient settings where renal biomarkers are often unavailable; the work investigates whether routinely collected non-renal variables can support CKD classification.

Method: Derive discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data using supervised contrastive learning; perform downstream CKD classification with a nonlinear Random Forest; evaluate on a clinic-based Riverside Nephrology dataset and test generalizability on the UCI CKD dataset.

Result: NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance, with notable improvement in F1 for early-stage CKD; demonstrates generalizability across distinct patient cohorts.

Conclusion: NORA is a promising CKD risk stratification approach that leverages non-renal data and representation learning to aid early detection in outpatient settings and across cohorts.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

### [166] [Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727)
*Jie Yin,Ke Sun,Han Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified regularization framework for graph continual learning (GCL) using the curvature of the parameter space via the Fisher information matrix (FIM); shows Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) as a special diagonal-FIM case; introduces an unbiased online curvature estimator that works without storing the FIM; achieves state-of-the-art stability-plasticity on replay-free, class-incremental GCL across three graph datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in graph continual learning, especially in replay-free, class-incremental settings where tasks introduce new classes. Traditional diagonal FIM-based regularizers (e.g., EWC) have limitations in capturing curvature of the loss landscape, motivating a curvature-aware, online regularization approach.

Method: Formulates a general regularization framework for GCL on a curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix. Shows that dominant EWC and variants are special cases under a diagonal FIM approximation using parameters from previous tasks. Proposes a new unbiased online curvature estimation of the full FIM based on the current learning state, allowing direct online estimation of the regularization term without storing the FIM.

Result: Empirically, the proposed online curvature regularizer outperforms existing regularization-based methods on three graph datasets, achieving a better balance between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (learning new tasks) in replay-free, class-incremental GCL.

Conclusion: The research provides a curvature-aware regularization framework for graph continual learning, unifying EWC as a special case and demonstrating that online curvature estimation yields superior performance in maintaining past knowledge while enabling new task learning without requiring FIM storage.

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

### [167] [A Graph Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Topological Patterns in Transactional Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12730)
*Francesco Zola,Jon Ander Medina,Andrea Venturi,Amaia Gil,Raul Orduna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A topology-driven graph ML approach using a four-step preprocessing pipeline and Graph Autoencoders to detect well-known topological patterns in transaction graphs, addressing sparse unlabeled data for financial crime detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial ecosystems face evolving abuse tactics that share techniques; rule-based systems are insufficient; there is value in analyzing actors' interactions and topology to uncover modus operandi.

Method: Four-step preprocessing: (i) extract graph structures, (ii) incorporate temporality to manage large node sets, (iii) detect communities, (iv) automatic labeling to generate weak ground-truth; then implement and compare three Graph Autoencoder variants to distinguish topological patterns.

Result: Preliminary results indicate the topology-driven approach is effective at detecting complex financial crime schemes and offers an alternative to conventional rule-based detection.

Conclusion: Topology-aware graph ML with weak supervision shows promise for financial crime pattern detection and could complement existing detection systems; further validation and broader evaluation needed.

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

*Rishab Parthasarathy,Achintya Bhowmik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end AI-based pathway analysis for cancer prognosis and treatment recommendation using TCGA-derived mutation sequences, with RNN-based severity prediction and probabilistic forecasting of future mutations tied to drug-target data; achieves ROC >60% and highlights key driver mutations via heatmaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a cost-effective, scalable alternative to wet-lab-driven pathway analysis for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, leveraging time-series AI and integrated databases.

Method: Extract mutation sequences from TCGA; filter key mutations by frequency via a preprocessing algorithm; input into an RNN to predict cancer severity; combine RNN forecasts with preprocessing outputs and drug-target databases to probabilistically predict future mutations and recommend treatments; produce heatmaps of predicted gene frequency.

Result: ROC curves with accuracies >60%, comparable to existing diagnostics; identification of hundreds of key driver mutations per cancer stage; heatmaps show key mutations; demonstrates an efficient end-to-end framework not reliant on extensive wet-lab work.

Conclusion: This study is among the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end AI-driven framework for projecting cancer progression and suggesting potential treatments without heavy dependence on wet-lab experiments.

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

### [169] [Similarity-Distance-Magnitude Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12760)
*Allen Schmaltz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust, interpretable activation (SDM) that augments softmax with Similarity, Distance-to-training-distribution, and Magnitude awareness, improving robustness to covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs, while enabling exemplar-based interpretability and better selective classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax, though widely used, can be brittle under covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs and offers limited interpretability. There is a need for a final-layer activation that is robust, calibrated, and interpretable, especially for selective classification tasks.

Method: Introduce the Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation by incorporating (1) Similarity (depth-matches with training) awareness, (2) Distance-to-training-distribution awareness, and (3) Magnitude (decision-boundary) awareness into the standard softmax. Apply SDM as the final-layer activation in language models; use dense matching for exemplar-based interpretability; partition class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall in selective classifications; evaluate in contexts including post-hoc calibration.

Result: SDM activation demonstrated to be more robust than softmax in high-probability regions under covariate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs. It provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. The method enables partitioning of class-wise empirical CDFs to safeguard against low recall in selective classifications, and remains advantageous even when post-hoc calibration is used.

Conclusion: SDM offers a more robust, interpretable alternative to softmax for final-layer activation, particularly benefiting selective classification and calibrated predictions, by explicitly accounting for similarity to training data, distributional distance, and decision boundary magnitude.

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

TL;DR: EmbeddedML presents a training-time-optimized ML library claiming substantial speedups over scikit-learn across regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large datasets cause long training times; there is a need for faster ML libraries that preserve accuracy.

Method: Mathematically rewrite and optimize key algorithms (notably Logistic Regression and SVM) to reduce training time and improve accuracy; extend optimizations to regression and provide a suite of algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction) within EmbeddedML.

Result: Reported training-time reductions include ~2x for SVM on small datasets and ~800x on large datasets, ~4x for Logistic Regression, with no loss in accuracy in regression models and overall speedups compared to scikit-learn.

Conclusion: EmbeddedML offers a collection of rewritten/optimized algorithms that significantly reduce training time across multiple ML tasks while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning models and libraries can train datasets of different sizes
and perform prediction and classification operations, but machine learning
models and libraries cause slow and long training times on large datasets. This
article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

*Wilfrid Sougrinoma Compaoré,Yaya Etiabi,El Mehdi Amhoud,Mohamad Assaad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning framework for IoT that uses finite blocklength transmission, model quantization, and error-aware aggregation to save energy and improve reliability, with uplink power optimization; claims up to 75% energy savings while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices are highly resource-constrained with limited energy, unreliable communications, and the impractical assumption of infinite blocklength transmissions. There is a need for energy-efficient, reliable FL tailored to IoT.

Method: Proposes a FL framework for IoT that (i) accounts for finite blocklength transmission, (ii) applies model quantization, (iii) employs an error-aware aggregation mechanism, and (iv) optimizes uplink transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance.

Result: Simulation results indicate substantial energy savings (up to 75%) compared to standard FL, with maintained model accuracy and improved reliability.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient and reliable FL implementations in real-world, resource-constrained IoT deployments and paves the way for practical IoT-enabled FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

### [172] [Safe Reinforcement Learning using Action Projection: Safeguard the Policy or the Environment?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12833)
*Hannah Markgraf,Shamburaj Sawant,Hanna Krasowski,Lukas Schäfer,Sebastien Gros,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Projection-based safety filters in RL are analyzed to compare SE-RL (safeguards in the environment) and SP-RL (safeguards in the policy). Action aliasing harms SP-RL more; SE-RL's critic implicitly handles it, while SP-RL suffers from rank-deficient Jacobians. The work formalizes both, analyzes gradients, proposes mitigation including a penalty-based method for SP-RL, and shows empirically that SP-RL can match or beat improved SE-RL under the right conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite practical use, there is no formal understanding of how projection-based safety enforcement differs between SE-RL and SP-RL, especially under action aliasing. A unified theory can guide method selection and improvements in safety-critical RL.

Method: Develop a unified actor-critic formalization of SE-RL and SP-RL, perform theoretical analysis of policy gradient estimates under action aliasing, propose mitigation strategies including a SP-RL penalty aligning with SE-RL practices, and validate with experiments across environments.

Result: Action aliasing degrades SP-RL more than SE-RL; SP-RL experiences rank-deficient Jacobians during backprop through the safeguard; SE-RL's critic partially mitigates aliasing; proposed improvements (penalties) enable SP-RL to match or outperform improved SE-RL.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance on when to use SE-RL vs SP-RL and how to mitigate aliasing; demonstrates that carefully designed SP-RL with penalty-based improvements can be competitive with SE-RL across tasks.

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, and specialized tool use in real-world tasks; integrating executable tools and multi-step workflows can enhance reliability and applicability.

Method: Tool-R1 enables LLMs to generate Python code to orchestrate general and user-defined tools plus standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to form coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward combines LLM judgment and code execution success. A dynamic sample queue caches high-quality trajectories to improve training efficiency.

Conclusion: Tool-R1 demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of tool-augmented reasoning via executable code, with potential for reliable, efficient real-world application; code will be released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and

### [174] [TimeCluster with PCA is Equivalent to Subspace Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12895)
*Christian L. Hines,Samuel Spillard,Daniel P. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCA-based TimeCluster is mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification on a Hankel/ sliding-window matrix; the two embeddings coincide, as shown by theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and real data; this equivalence enables forecasting, online extensions, external inputs, and robust trend visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect a visualization-driven time-series clustering method (TimeCluster) with established subspace identification theory, clarifying the shared state-space structure and enabling new capabilities.

Method: Form a sliding-window (Hankel) matrix from a multivariate time series and apply PCA (via SVD) to extract a low-dimensional subspace. Show that the principal directions coincide with those from block-Hankel SVD used in subspace identification. Review TimeCluster and subspace theory, prove the equivalence, and validate with experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals.

Result: Mathematical equivalence is established: TimeCluster's embedding equals subspace identification results; empirical experiments confirm that the two embeddings coincide and yield the same cluster/state-space coordinates.

Conclusion: The equivalence opens opportunities for forecasting from the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating external inputs, and robust visualizations of trends in corrupted data; outlines future directions for leveraging this link.

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

TL;DR: Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) enable exact gradients for implicit fixed-point models, removing regularization and reducing computation, achieving state-of-the-art results on language and vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEQs have unstable training due to approximate gradients and require regularization or many evaluations; a reversible, exact-gradient approach could stabilize training and improve efficiency.

Method: Introduce RevDEQ architecture that uses reversible dynamics to enable exact gradient computation through the implicit fixed-point, reducing function evaluations and removing the need for regularization.

Result: RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling and image classification compared to similar implicit and explicit models.

Conclusion: RevDEQs offer a practical, efficient alternative to DEQs, enabling exact backpropagation in implicit models and improving performance without extra regularization.

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

TL;DR: A soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that incorporates a learnable linear feature transform into the boosting process via soft decision trees; effective in high-dimensional, data-scarce settings; enables end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and boosting; extensible to differentiable non-linear transforms; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional and data-scarce settings require learning relevant input representations while boosting, to improve generalization and performance without overfitting.

Method: Iterative boosting where at each step, train a soft decision tree and jointly learn a linear input transform Q; end-to-end optimization; can extend to differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not problematic; evaluate on synthetic and real-world datasets; code public.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance and efficiency via end-to-end optimization; effective in discovering relevant representations and boosting; avoids overfitting; evidence from experiments; extension to non-linear transforms as needed.

Conclusion: The framework is promising for sequential regression in high-dimensional, data-scarce regimes; offers end-to-end feature learning within boosting; public code supports reproducibility; potential for future work exploring non-linear transforms and generalization.

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the trade-offs among common alignment methods and aims to guide the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified

### [178] [Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939)
*Haneen Najjar,Eyal Ronen,Mahmood Sharif*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sy-FAR introduces symmetry as a fairness notion for adversarial robustness in real-world tasks like face recognition. It argues perfect parity is infeasible due to inherent class similarity and shows that promoting symmetric attack transfer (i to j vs j to i) yields fairer robustness. The method is evaluated across five datasets and three architectures against targeted and untargeted attacks, showing improved fair robustness, faster convergence, and reduced undesired biases toward certain target classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unfair robustness in adversarial ML, where some class pairs are more easily attacked than others. Perfect fairness is often infeasible in realistic, high-similarity domains (e.g., face recognition). The authors propose symmetry as a tractable fairness notion that leverages the common, typically symmetric notion of visual similarity between classes.

Method: Propose Sy-FAR, a training objective/regularizer that encourages symmetry in adversarial outcomes across class pairs while optimizing standard robustness. Evaluates on five datasets with three model architectures, under targeted and untargeted, physically realizable attacks.

Result: Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness relative to state-of-the-art methods, is faster and more consistent across runs, and reduces the tendency of adversaries to push examples toward particular target classes.

Conclusion: Symmetry is a practical and effective fairness notion in adversarial robustness for symmetry-prone domains. Inducing symmetry yields fairness across subgroups and can coexist with robustness goals, suggesting broader applicability in fairness-critical ML systems.

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

### [179] [Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation, and classification of cardiac trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12953)
*Jaume Banus,Augustin C. Ogier,Roger Hullin,Philippe Meyer,Ruud B. van Heeswijk,Jonas Richiardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework combining neural ODEs, GNNs, and neural processes to model structured spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics from sparse observations, using spatiotemporal multiplex graphs to infer latent trajectories and interpolate/extrapolate; validated on synthetic systems and real cardiac datasets with strong classification/extrapolation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model uncertain, structured cardiac motion from sparse data by integrating NODEs, GNNs, and neural processes, capturing uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure.

Method: A probabilistic model with spatiotemporal multiplex graphs where a GNN-parameterized vector field drives latent trajectories. Given sparse context at nodes/edges, infer distributions over latent initial states and control variables (via neural processes), enabling interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories; validated on synthetic dynamics and real cardiac imaging datasets (ACDC, UK Biobank).

Result: The method achieves accurate trajectory reconstruction and extrapolation, and strong disease classification performance, including state-of-the-art ~99% accuracy on ACDC classification and competitive atrial fibrillation detection on UK Biobank (~67% accuracy).

Conclusion: A flexible, graph-based, probabilistic framework for structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series that supports uncertainty-aware interpolation/extrapolation and provides a foundation for graph-based learning in cardiac motion analysis.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

### [180] [BAPFL: Exploring Backdoor Attacks Against Prototype-based Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12964)
*Honghong Zeng,Jiong Lou,Zhe Wang,Hefeng Zhou,Chentao Wu,Wei Zhao,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes BAPFL, the first backdoor attack tailored for prototype-based federated learning (PFL), combining prototype poisoning and per-target trigger optimization to substantially boost attack success while preserving accuracy across multiple PFL variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test and challenge the assumed robustness of prototype-based federated learning against backdoor threats by designing a specialized, stealthy attack.

Method: Introduce BAPFL with two components: (1) prototype poisoning that steers the global prototype trajectories so benign clients’ local prototypes diverge from trigger samples; (2) trigger optimization that learns a unique, stealthy trigger for each potential target label, guiding trigger-embedded samples to align with the target prototype. Implemented within PFL frameworks and evaluated on several datasets and PFL variants.

Result: BAPFL achieves a 35%-75% higher attack success rate than traditional backdoor attacks while preserving main task accuracy across datasets and PFL variants.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that PFL’s inherent robustness to backdoor attacks can be undermined by a tailored attack, highlighting the need for defenses focused on prototype dynamics and trigger design and inviting further study into secure PFL.

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

### [181] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QPE-based identifiability under a finite linear span; basis tests distinguish bivariate causal directions; Fisher Information aids multivariate causal order under second-moment assumptions; validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploit shape asymmetries in the observational distribution via Quantile Partial Effects to identify causal directions without requiring explicit mechanism or noise models.

Method: Theoretically establish identifiability when the QPE of cause on effect lies in a finite linear span. Use basis function tests on estimated QPE to determine causal direction in bivariate cases. For multivariate cases, leverage the link between QPE and score functions to show Fisher Information suffices for determining causal order under assumptions on the second moment of QPE. Validate feasibility on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Identifiability of cause from observational distribution under the finite-span QPE assumption. Empirical effectiveness of basis-function tests on bivariate causal discovery datasets. Demonstrated sufficiency of Fisher Information for multivariate order under second-moment assumptions, with experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: QPE provides a distribution-level avenue for causal discovery that avoids explicit mechanism modeling and Markov assumptions, with practical methods for direction and order inference under modest parametric assumptions.

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

### [182] [Bridging Performance Gaps for Foundation Models: A Post-Training Strategy for ECGFounder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12991)
*Ya Zhou,Yujie Yang,Xiaohan Fan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple post-training strategy boosts ECGFoundationModel performance on PTB-XL, yielding gains in macro AUROC and macro AUPRC, with improved data efficiency and stability; ablations highlight stochastic depth and preview linear probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational ECG models underperform task-specific models, suggesting that pretraining and fine-tuning alone are insufficient; a post-training step could bridge this gap.

Method: Propose and apply a simple post-training approach to ECGFounder (a large ECG foundation model trained on >7M recordings). Evaluate on PTB-XL, compare to baseline fine-tuning and recent SOTA. Conduct ablations to identify components, notably stochastic depth and preview linear probing.

Result: Baseline fine-tuning gains: +1.2–3.3% macro AUROC and +5.3–20.9% macro AUPRC. Overall, outperforms several recent SOTA approaches (task-specific and advanced architectures). With only 10% of training data, macro AUROC improves by 9.1% and macro AUPRC by 34.9%. The method is more stable and sample-efficient than the baseline.

Conclusion: Post-training strategies can meaningfully improve ECG foundation models, enabling closer performance to or surpassing task-specific models and supporting broader adoption in ECG analytics.

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

TL;DR: A probabilistic latent-space visualization for data ensembles using a VAE, yielding Gaussian latent representations that allow analytic confidence intervals and density estimation; demonstrated on weather forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visualize and quantify uncertainty in high-dimensional ensembles; provide tractable probabilistic representations via latent Gaussian space.

Method: Convert spatial features into latent space via feature-space transformation; train a variational autoencoder to map features to a multivariate standard Gaussian latent space; use VAE prior to enable analytic CI and density estimation; unsupervised learning; apply to data ensemble.

Result: Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble show effectiveness and versatility of the approach.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible probabilistic framework for ensemble visualization, enabling analytic uncertainty quantification and density estimation; with potential applicability beyond weather data.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

### [184] [ReTrack: Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models through Redirecting the Denoising Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13007)
*Qitan Shi,Cheng Jin,Jiawei Zhang,Yuantao Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReTrack: fast data unlearning for diffusion models via an importance-sampling–driven fine-tuning loss that retains only dominant terms to steer denoising toward k-nearest neighbors, achieving strong unlearning with minimal quality loss across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can memorize training data, creating privacy and safety risks. Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific data without retraining from scratch.

Method: Apply importance sampling to build a fine-tuning loss focused on influential terms; approximate by keeping only dominant terms, yielding an interpretable objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). This enables efficient unlearning via fine-tuning instead of full retraining.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MNIST, T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion shows ReTrack achieving state-of-the-art performance in the trade-off between unlearning strength and preservation of generation quality.

Conclusion: ReTrack provides a fast, effective data unlearning approach for diffusion models, removing the influence of targeted data without large degradation to generative performance and without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

*Yukun Chen,Zhaoxi Mu,Andong Li,Peilin Li,Xinyu Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ultra-low-energy Spiking Vocos: a spiking neural vocoder that rivals ANN performance while using only ~15% of the energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural vocoders have improved in speed and fidelity but remain energy-hungry, hindering deployment on edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency but suffer from information bottlenecks. The work aims to close the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs while keeping energy extremely low.

Method: Introduce Spiking Vocos based on the Vocos framework. Add a Spiking ConvNeXt module to cut MAC operations and an amplitude shortcut path to preserve signal dynamics. Use self-architectural distillation to transfer knowledge from ANN, and incorporate a lightweight Temporal Shift Module to fuse temporal information with minimal overhead.

Result: Experiments show performance comparable to the ANN counterpart, with UTMOS 3.74 and PESQ 3.45, while consuming only 14.7% of the energy.

Conclusion: Spiking Vocos demonstrates that an SNN-based vocoder can achieve competitive speech quality at a fraction of the energy of its ANN counterpart, enabling practical edge-device deployment; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

*Lorenzo Pes,Bojian Yin,Sander Stuijk,Federico Corradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A forward-only, memory-efficient local learning rule for SNNs (Traces Propagation, TP) combines eligibility traces with layer-wise contrastive loss to enable scalable, on-device training without auxiliary matrices, achieving strong results on multiple datasets and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients is biologically implausible and memory-intensive; local learning rules struggle with spatial credit assignment, hindering efficient edge learning.

Method: Introduce Traces Propagation (TP): a fully local, forward-only rule that uses eligibility traces and a layer-wise contrastive loss, eliminating auxiliary matrices and scaling to deeper networks.

Result: TP outperforms other fully local methods on NMNIST and SHD; competitive on DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10; scales to VGG-9; favorable memory scaling; effective for practical fine-tuning tasks like Google Speech Commands.

Conclusion: TP provides a practical, scalable local learning paradigm for SNNs, enabling efficient edge learning and improved support for complex, real-world tasks.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

*Mengyi Deng,Xin Li,Tingyu Zhu,Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bidirectional reasoning data can improve alignment with reverse-data SFT, but naive data mixing harms directionality. DPO helps partially yet can bias outputs away from less-preferred reasoning paths; calls for direction-aware, robust alignment strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how unidirectional SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) behave when training with bidirectional reasoning objectives, and whether mixed forward/reverse data improves alignment.

Method: Create a reverse reasoning dataset r1k by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k. Evaluate SFT and DPO on bidirectional reasoning tasks, comparing against baseline SFT with s1k. Analyze effects of mixing forward/reverse data on directional distinction and alignment.

Result: SFT on r1k yields 1.6%–6.8% accuracy improvement over s1k across benchmarks. Naively mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens directional distinction. DPO partially recovers the distinction but shifts probability mass toward irrelevant outputs, suppressing less-preferred reasoning paths.

Conclusion: Mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting supervision signals that undermine direction-aware alignment; robust and direction-aware strategies are needed to align models under bidirectional reasoning objectives.

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffuSR uses a diffusion-based pretraining framework for symbolic regression that embeds discrete symbols into a continuous latent space to model equation distributions and denoise into valid equations, achieving competitive accuracy and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression faces a combinatorial search space and an accuracy-vs.-complexity trade-off; a diffusion-based approach with a trainable symbol embedding can capture equation distributions and improve generation quality.

Method: Introduce a trainable embedding layer to map symbols to a continuous latent space within a diffusion process; iterative denoising to form symbolic equations; inject numerical data via cross-attention; inference strategy that injects logit priors into genetic programming.

Result: DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art autoregressive methods on standard benchmarks and produces more interpretable and diverse mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: DiffuSR demonstrates the viability of diffusion-based symbolic regression and paves the way for more robust, interpretable equation discovery; cross-attention data injection and logit-prior-informed inference contribute to its performance.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

*Paul Garnier,Vincent Lannelongue,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coarse-to-fine curriculum training for GNNs on CFD meshes accelerates training and maintains accuracy by progressively increasing mesh resolution without altering the model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training GNNs on high-resolution unstructured CFD meshes is computationally expensive; existing approaches rely on architectural multiscale schemes. A data-driven curriculum that varies data fidelity could reduce cost while preserving performance.

Method: Train the same GNN architecture, but start on very coarse CFD meshes and progressively introduce medium and high-resolution meshes during training, up to about 3x10^5 nodes; no architectural changes.

Result: Generalization accuracy is comparable to training on high-resolution data alone, with up to 50% reduction in total wall-clock time. The curriculum helps the model break through training plateaus when capacity is insufficient to capture physics.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning via coarse-to-fine data fidelity is an effective and architecture-agnostic strategy to accelerate GNN training for CFD on unstructured meshes and can help models learn physics when capacity is limited.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

### [190] [Learning from Heterophilic Graphs: A Spectral Theory Perspective on the Impact of Self-Loops and Parallel Edges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13139)
*Kushal Bose,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work links how adding self-loops and parallel edges to heterophilic graphs shifts the graph Laplacian spectrum with the performance of low-pass MP-GNNs, proposing a spectrum-aware evaluation method that avoids expensive eigen-decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterophily challenges MP-GNNs, and understanding the spectral factors that govern their performance is crucial. The paper seeks to explain how spectral changes induced by simple graph augmentations relate to MP-GNN behavior and to provide an efficient, spectrum-aware evaluation approach.

Method: The authors augment heterophilic graphs with self-loops and parallel edges and study the resulting changes in the graph Laplacian eigenvalues. They perform GCN experiments on benchmark heterophilic graphs under these augmentations, analyze the resulting performance trends, and establish theoretical connections between spectral shifts and MP-GNN performance. They further propose a way to evaluate graph spectra indirectly via performance trends, avoiding direct eigenvalue decomposition.

Result: They observe that adding self-loops lowers Laplacian eigenvalues, whereas adding parallel edges raises them. GCN performance on heterophilic graphs exhibits either increasing or decreasing trends depending on the augmentation. The authors connect these performance trends to spectral changes, showing that graph spectra capture intrinsic graph properties such as components, sparsity, average degree, and clusters. They propose a practical, spectrum-aware evaluation method that infers spectral information from performance trends without performing eigen-decomposition, supported by theoretical foundations.

Conclusion: Graph spectra reflect essential input graph properties and influence MP-GNN performance on heterophilic graphs. The proposed spectrum-aware evaluation provides a cost-effective way to assess spectral effects without eigen-decomposition and offers theoretical validation for the observed links between added self-loops/parallel edges, spectral shifts, and low-pass MP-GNN behavior.

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinSearchComp is the first fully open-source benchmark for end-to-end financial search and reasoning, featuring three tasks (Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, Complex Historical Investigation), 635 questions across global and Greater China markets, annotated by 70 experts, evaluated on 21 models. Web search and financial plugins improve performance; model/tool country-origin significantly impacts results, providing a rigorous, professional testbed for realistic financial analyst workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance demands complex, time-sensitive, domain-specific search and knowledge-grounded reasoning. There was no open, end-to-end benchmark evaluating data searching capability in financial agents, due to the difficulty of constructing realistic tasks and accessing time-sensitive data. FinSearchComp aims to fill this gap with realistic workflows and professional annotations.

Method: Three tasks mirroring analyst workflows: Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, Complex Historical Investigation. 635 questions spanning global and Greater China markets. 70 professional financial experts annotated tasks; multi-stage QA pipeline ensures reliability. Evaluation across 21 models (products). Investigates impact of web search and financial plugins and country-origin effects of models/tools.

Result: Grok 4 (web) leads the global subset with near expert-level accuracy; DouBao (web) leads the Greater China subset. Web search and financial plugins substantially boost agent performance. Country origin of models/tools significantly affects results, highlighting cross-domain transfer and availability issues. Overall, FinSearchComp provides a demanding, open benchmark closely aligned with real-world analyst tasks.

Conclusion: FinSearchComp offers a professional, high-difficulty, open-ended benchmark for complex financial search and reasoning, enabling end-to-end evaluation of LLM-based financial agents and driving progress toward more capable, domain-aware systems.

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

### [192] [On the Correlation between Individual Fairness and Predictive Accuracy in Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13165)
*Alessandro Antonucci,Eric Rossetto,Ivan Duvnjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private features correlates with predictive accuracy in generative probabilistic classifiers; empirical evidence across 14 fairness-focused datasets using Bayesian networks; robustness analysis reformulated as a MAP task in an auxiliary MRF to handle multi-feature perturbations; results support the robustness-accuracy link and suggest directions to mitigate the fairness–accuracy trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between individual fairness and accuracy in generative probabilistic models by linking robustness to private-feature perturbations with predictive performance, and to address computational challenges via a MAP reformulation in an auxiliary MRF.

Method: Assess robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private features within Bayesian-network-based generative models; evaluate on a benchmark of 14 fairness-oriented datasets; reformulate robustness analysis as a most-probable-explanation (MAP) task in an auxiliary Markov random field to manage computational complexity.

Result: Experiments confirm the hypothesized robustness–accuracy correlation across datasets; the approach provides evidence that more robust instances tend to be classified more accurately, suggesting pathways to reduce the fairness–accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Robustness analysis can illuminate the relationship between fairness and accuracy in generative probabilistic classifiers; the MAP-on-MRF reformulation offers a scalable tool and points to design avenues for fairer and more accurate models.

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

### [193] [CoVariance Filters and Neural Networks over Hilbert Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13178)
*Claudio Battiloro,Andrea Cavallo,Elvin Isufi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends CoVariance Neural Networks to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces via Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) built on the empirical covariance operator; shows a discretization that recovers Functional PCA and demonstrates robust time-series classification across synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize covariance-based graph convolutions from finite-dimensional signals to infinite-dimensional settings, preserving robustness and transferability while connecting to functional data analysis (FPCA) and RKHS frameworks.

Method: Introduce HVFs as covariance-operator-based filters on Hilbert spaces, stack them into HVNs with nonlinear activations, and provide a principled discretization. Prove that empirical HVFs recover FPCA of filtered signals. Demonstrate versatility across multivariate functions and RKHS. Validate on synthetic and real-world time-series tasks.

Result: Empirical HVFs can recover FPCA of filtered signals, and HVNs achieve robust classification on synthetic and real-world time-series data, outperforming MLPs and FPCA-based classifiers in the reported tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generalizes covariance-based neural filtering to infinite-dimensional spaces, linking HVFs to FPCA and RKHS, and offering a practical, robust approach for time-series classification with potential broad applicability.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

### [194] [Is Meta-Learning Out? Rethinking Unsupervised Few-Shot Classification with Limited Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13185)
*Yunchuan Guan,Yu Liu,Ke Zhou,Zhiqi Shen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Serge Belongie,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning can provide tighter generalization bounds and robustness than whole-class training in entropy-limited settings; a new MINO framework uses adaptive clustering (DBSCAN), a dynamic head, and a stability-based meta-scaler to boost unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is debate that whole-class training can match meta-learning in few-shot classification. To enable fair comparison, an entropy-limited supervised setting is proposed. The authors show, both theoretically and empirically, that meta-learning yields tighter generalization bounds, especially under label noise and heterogeneous tasks, and explore its value for unsupervised tasks.

Method: The paper conducts theoretical analysis and experiments comparing meta-learning with whole-class training under an entropy-limited setting. It then introduces MINO, a meta-learning framework for unsupervised performance: using DBSCAN-based adaptive clustering to construct unsupervised tasks, a dynamic head for flexible task handling, and a stability-based meta-scaler to improve robustness to label noise. The approach is validated on unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Result: Meta-learning achieves a tighter generalization bound and is more sample-efficient under limited entropy; it is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks. MINO demonstrates improved unsupervised performance across multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Meta-learning remains valuable, particularly in low-entropy, noisy, or heterogeneous environments. The MINO framework shows how careful unsupervised task construction and robustness mechanisms can harness meta-learning to boost unsupervised performance; future work could further integrate unsupervised task design with meta-learning and robustness.

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

### [195] [TRUST-FS: Tensorized Reliable Unsupervised Multi-View Feature Selection for Incomplete Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13192)
*Minghui Lu,Yanyong Huang,Minbo Ma,Dongjie Wang,Xiuwen Yi,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TRUST-FS, a tensorized CP-based MUFS method for incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, jointly learning feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weights, guided by a trustworthy similarity graph derived via Subjective Logic; demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses three key challenges in MUFS: (1) incomplete data with missing variables across views; (2) the coupling of imputation and feature selection instead of treating them separately; (3) inaccurate similarity graphs due to missing data that degrade feature selection performance.

Method: Adaptive-weighted CP decomposition within a unified tensor factorization framework that jointly performs feature selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning; employs Subjective Logic to obtain trustworthy cross-view similarity for constructing a reliable similarity graph that guides both imputation and feature selection.

Result: Empirical results show TRUST-FS is effective and offers superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on incomplete multi-view data.

Conclusion: A unified framework successfully handles missing variables, joint imputation and feature selection, and robust similarity graph learning, improving multi-view unsupervised feature selection performance.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

### [196] [B-TGAT: A Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer for Clustering Multivariate Spatiotemporal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13202)
*Francis Ndikum Nji,Vandana Janaja,Jianwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder with a Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) is proposed to cluster high-dimensional spatiotemporal climate data; it integrates ConvLSTM2D-based encoding/decoding with U-Net skip connections and a graph-attention bottleneck to capture local/global temporal dynamics while preserving spatial context, yielding discriminative latent representations for clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering high-dimensional, non-stationary spatiotemporal climate data is challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial interactions, and the need to preserve spatial context; conventional recurrent/conv models struggle to capture both local and global temporal relationships while maintaining spatial coherence.

Method: A time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder where ConvLSTM2D modules extract joint spatial–temporal features; U-Net skip connections preserve multiscale spatial details; at the bottleneck, Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) performs graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal encoding to weight temporal neighbors and capture short- and long-range dependencies across regions, producing discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering.

Result: Experiments on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets show superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions compared to state-of-the-art baselines; the architecture yields improved temporal clustering performance with interpretable insights into spatiotemporal variability.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while preserving spatial context, advancing methodological development and climate science applications and enabling interpretable analysis of complex spatiotemporal variability.

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

### [197] [HAM: Hierarchical Adapter Merging for Scalable Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13211)
*Eric Nuertey Coleman,Luigi Quarantiello,Samrat Mukherjee,Julio Hurtado,Vincenzo Lomonaco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable continual learning framework that merges task adapters hierarchically to improve efficiency and transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome catastrophic forgetting and inefficiency of one-adapter-per-task in continual learning, even with PEFT; enable scaling to many tasks.

Method: Maintain a fixed set of adapter groups; train a low-rank adapter with an importance scalar per task; dynamically group tasks by adapter similarity; within each group prune, scale, and merge adapters to facilitate transfer.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three vision benchmarks, particularly as the number of tasks increases, with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: HAM enables scalable, efficient continual learning by dynamically merging adapters across related tasks, reducing interference and promoting transfer.

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

### [198] [Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13213)
*Paolo Climaco,Jochen Garcke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling (DA-FPS) to select training data from unlabeled data for regression when labeled data is scarce. The method uses a data-driven bound based on weighted fill distance for Lipschitz regressors and aims to minimize it, improving predictive accuracy with a model-agnostic, passive sampling strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When labeled data is expensive or limited due to compute or labeling costs, there is a need for efficient, model-agnostic sampling strategies that can be applied using only feature representations.

Method: Derive an upper bound on the expected prediction error for Lipschitz regression that scales with the weighted fill distance of the training set. Introduce DA-FPS, a sampling method that approximately minimizes a data-driven estimate of the weighted fill distance. Demonstrate that DA-FPS is an approximate minimizer of the bound and is independent of the regression model.

Result: Empirically, DA-FPS significantly reduces mean absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies across two regression models and three datasets.

Conclusion: Density-aware sampling based on a theoretical bound provides an effective, model-agnostic approach for data-efficient regression. DA-FPS improves predictive accuracy under label scarcity by selecting training points that minimize a data-driven metric related to weighted fill distance.

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

### [199] [FOSSIL: Regret-minimizing weighting for robust learning under imbalance and small data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13218)
*J. Cha,J. Lee,J. Cho,J. Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL is a unified, regret-minimizing weighting framework for learning with imbalanced and small data, integrating class imbalance correction, difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics without changing model architecture, yielding theoretical guarantees and empirical gains over standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address pervasive imbalanced and small-data regimes where labeled samples are scarce and naive augmentation can introduce artifacts; existing methods tackle isolated aspects but remain fragile or complex, necessitating a cohesive, theoretically grounded solution.

Method: Proposes FOSSIL: a single, interpretable weighting formula that combines class imbalance correction, difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics; provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and is compatible with existing architectures without any changes.

Result: Empirically, FOSSIL achieves consistent gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets, across imbalanced and small-data settings.

Conclusion: FOSSIL offers a flexible, interpretable, theoretically grounded framework that unifies several balancing and curriculum-learning strategies, delivering reliable improvements without requiring architectural modifications.

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

### [200] [On the Out-of-Distribution Backdoor Attack for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13219)
*Jiahao Xu,Zikai Zhang,Rui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes OOD-based backdoor in federated learning (OBA), adds SoDa stealthy update regularization, and BNGuard server-side defense against SoDa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expands backdoor practicality in federated learning by eliminating reliance on visible triggers and physical modifications; current defenses struggle against OOD-based schemes.

Method: OBA uses out-of-distribution data as poisoned samples and triggers; SoDa regularizes the magnitude and direction of malicious local models to align them with benign ones; BNGuard analyzes batch norm running statistics to identify and exclude anomalous updates.

Result: OBA effectively bypasses state-of-the-art defenses while preserving main-task accuracy; BNGuard effectively defends against SoDa; code provided.

Conclusion: The work exposes vulnerabilities in FL backdoors and introduces an OOD-aware defense plan, underscoring the need for robust aggregation and anomaly detection that accounts for OOD-driven shifts.

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

### [201] [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)
*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO is a group-free, KL-adaptive value tracker for policy gradient in LLMs that normalizes advantages globally, yielding lower variance, higher throughput, and better performance than GRPO across math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fix flaws of group-based variance reduction in GRPO—degenerate groups erasing learning signals and synchronization barriers hurting scalability—and to enable scalable, robust RL for LLM reasoning with varied generation times.

Method: Introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO) with a persistent KL-adaptive value tracker and global advantage normalization across the batch. It eliminates per-group baselines, supports higher throughput, scales to long-horizon/tool-integrated settings, and enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling.

Result: On Qwen3-8B, SPO converges more smoothly and achieves higher accuracy than GRPO, while removing wasted compute from degenerate groups. Ablations show gains stem from principled baseline estimation and advantage normalization. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3-8B, SPO improves average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points, with +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and shows consistent relative gain in pass@k across k. The work argues for a robust, efficient RL path for LLM reasoning without added architectural complexity.

Conclusion: SPO challenges the trend of adding incidental complexity to RL for LLMs, arguing that principled baseline estimation and advantage normalization can deliver scalable, high-performing LLM reasoning. The approach reduces wasted computation, supports adaptive curricula, and points to a promising direction for future RL in long-horizon or tool-enabled LLM tasks.

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

### [202] [Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13237)
*Aniket Didolkar,Nicolas Ballas,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes converting recurring multi-step reasoning into reusable behaviors (name + instruction) stored in a behavior handbook; enables behavior-conditioned inference, behavior-guided self-improvement, and behavior-conditioned SFT, reducing reasoning tokens and improving accuracy by leveraging remembered reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs solving complex problems generate extended chains of thought, causing token inflation and context-window saturation that impede exploration. The paper seeks a memory-based mechanism to capture and reuse effective reasoning fragments to accelerate and stabilize future reasoning.

Method: Identify recurring reasoning fragments via metacognitive analysis of prior traces; codify them as behaviors (name + instruction) and store in a behavior handbook. Use in-context at inference or distill into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. Evaluate across three settings: (1) behavior-conditioned inference, (2) behavior-guided self-improvement, (3) behavior-conditioned SFT.

Result: Behavior-conditioned inference reduces the number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while maintaining or improving accuracy; behavior-guided self-improvement yields up to 10% accuracy gains over a naive critique-and-revise baseline; behavior-conditioned SFT more effectively converts non-reasoning models into reasoning models compared to vanilla SFT.

Conclusion: Turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude, demonstrating a memory of reasoning patterns that boosts both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: NoRA introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework that directly adapts nonlinear activation functions using learnable rational forms with structured low-rank updates, achieving competitive or superior performance to full fine-tuning and weight-based PEFT while updating a tiny fraction of parameters; NoRA++ combines with LoRA for further gains, and the approach acts as a regularizing, activation-space alternative across vision and language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PEFT mainly tunes weight matrices, leaving activation functions fixed. This work explores activation-space adaptation to exploit potentially higher learning capacity with minimal parameter overhead and improved stability.

Method: Replace fixed activations with learnable rational functions; apply structured low-rank updates to the numerator and denominator of these activations; use a group-wise design to localize adaptation and enhance stability; optionally combine with LoRA (NoRA++) for synergistic gains; evaluate on ViT models trained on CIFAR-10/100 and on LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning.

Result: On CIFAR-10/100, NoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning while updating ~0.4% of parameters (0.02M), with accuracy gains of +0.17% and +0.27%. NoRA++ outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched budgets with fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B, NoRA++ yields average MMLU gains of +0.3%–0.8%, including +1.6% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3% on OpenOrca. Activation-space adaptation appears to constrain updates to a low-dimensional functional subspace, acting as implicit regularization.

Conclusion: Activation-space tuning via learnable rational activations is a viable, highly parameter-efficient complement to weight-based PEFT, providing stable adaptation and competitive gains across vision and language tasks, and positioning activation functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

### [204] [Post-Hoc Split-Point Self-Consistency Verification for Efficient, Unified Quantification of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13262)
*Zhizhong Zhao,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-hoc, single-forward-pass uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Split-Point Analysis (SPA) that decomposes predictive residuals into upper/lower subsets, derives Mean Absolute Residuals (MARs) on each side, and uses a Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS) to quantify epistemic uncertainty. Regression yields calibrated, side-specific prediction intervals via quantile regression; classification calibrates softmax via SPA identities to obtain calibrated predictive entropy. Claims competitive or superior performance with minimal overhead and no retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is crucial but existing approaches are either computationally heavy (Bayesian methods, ensembles) or narrowly scoped (single-forward-pass estimates). A post-hoc, retraining-free framework that jointly estimates aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty across regression and classification is highly desirable.

Method: Apply Split-Point Analysis to predictive residuals to split into upper and lower subsets, compute Mean Absolute Residuals (MARs) on each side. Under ideal conditions, total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define Self-consistency Discrepancy Score (SDS). For regression, use side-specific quantile regression to form prediction intervals, calibrated via SDS. For classification, with calibration data, apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust softmax outputs, then compute predictive entropy on calibrated probabilities.

Result: Experimental evaluations across diverse regression and classification benchmarks show the proposed framework matches or surpasses several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed SPA-based post-hoc framework provides an efficient, training-free approach to jointly quantify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, applicable to both regression and classification, with competitive performance and readily available open-source code.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

### [205] [JANUS: A Dual-Constraint Generative Framework for Stealthy Node Injection Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13266)
*Jiahao Zhang,Xiaobing Pei,Zhaokun Zhong,Wenqiang Hao,Zhenghao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JANUS is a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework for GNNs that uses local feature space alignment and global mutual-information-aligned latent structures, optimized as an RL sequential decision process, yielding stronger and stealthier attacks on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are vulnerable to node-injection attacks, and existing stealthiness proxies often fail to capture the injected content's intrinsic characteristics or address local structural myopia, motivating a more principled dual-constraint approach.

Method: Local level: local feature manifold alignment for geometric consistency in the feature space. Global level: structured latent variables with mutual information maximization to align injected structures with semantic patterns of the original graph. The injection is modeled as a sequential decision process optimized via reinforcement learning.

Result: JANUS significantly outperforms existing methods in attack effectiveness and stealthiness across multiple standard datasets.

Conclusion: A principled dual-constraint framework for stealthy node injection in GNNs that integrates local geometric alignment with global semantic structure via RL, demonstrating superior performance and stealth compared with prior approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

### [206] [LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from 24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a 10-shot prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13268)
*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEFT-finetuned open-source LLM, given only text 24h recalls, accurately predicts energy and macronutrients; vanilla LLM performs poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models can estimate nutritional values from text descriptions alone (without food images), enabling low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring.

Method: Use NHANES 24-hour recalls from 11,281 adolescents. Prompt a quantized open-source LLM with a 10-shot chain-of-thought approach to predict energy and five macronutrients from text strings listing foods and quantities. Then apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to assess performance improvements. Ground truth from NHANES.

Result: Vanilla LLM predictions were poor (mean absolute error for energy ~652.08; Lin’s CCC < 0.46). After PEFT finetuning, energy MAE improved to ~171.34–190.90 with Lin’s CCC > 0.89 for all endpoints (energy and the macronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber, total fat).

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought prompting combined with PEFT enables text-only LLMs to accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls, suggesting potential for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WebSailor is a post-training pipeline that teaches LLMs to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty in large information landscapes, achieving near-parity with proprietary agents on complex information-seeking tasks by combining high-uncertainty task generation, RFT cold start, and DUPO RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary agentic systems (e.g., DeepResearch) outperform open-source models on hard benchmarks like BrowseComp. The authors argue the key capability is a specialized uncertainty-reduction reasoning pattern, which is absent in open models and essential to close the gap.

Method: Generate novel, high-uncertainty tasks via structured sampling and information obfuscation; apply RFT cold start; train with an efficient agentic RL algorithm called Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO); integrate these components into a complete post-training pipeline (WebSailor).

Result: WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents on complex information-seeking tasks and matches proprietary agents, thereby closing the capability gap.

Conclusion: Post-training strategies like WebSailor can bridge the performance gap between open-source and proprietary agentic systems on challenging information-seeking benchmarks; the approach demonstrates the practical viability of instilling advanced uncertainty-reduction reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Abstract: We envision an integrated process for developing lunar construction
equipment, where physical design and control are explored in parallel. In this
paper, we describe a technical framework that supports this process. It relies
on OpenPLX, a readable/writable declarative language that links CAD-models and
autonomous systems to high-fidelity, real-time 3D simulations of contacting
multibody dynamics, machine regolith interaction forces, and non-ideal sensors.

### [209] [Geometric Red-Teaming for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12379)
*Divyam Goel,Yufei Wang,Tiancheng Wu,Guixiu Qiao,Pavel Piliptchak,David Held,Zackory Erickson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT) is a framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. It automatically generates CrashShapes—valid mesh deformations constrained by user—to reveal catastrophic failures in pre-trained policies, using a Jacobian-based deformation model with gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization. Red-teaming uncovers brittle failure modes; blue-teaming fine-tunes on those shapes to recover performance; validated in simulation and on a real robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic manipulation benchmarks rely on in-distribution test sets and static benchmarks, which miss plausible variations and failure modes. There is a need for a general, structured method to probe robustness to realistic geometric perturbations and to guide policy refinement.

Method: Develop a Jacobian-field based deformation model to produce CrashShapes (structurally valid, constrained mesh deformations). Use a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization to find deformations that degrade policy performance. Apply to insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks. Perform red-teaming to identify brittle geometries and blue-teaming to fine-tune policies on those geometries.

Result: Red-teaming discovers deformations that cause catastrophic performance drops not captured by static benchmarks. Blue-teaming on CrashShapes improves task success on those shapes by up to 60 percentage points while preserving performance on the original geometry. Real-robot experiments show simulated CrashShapes reduce success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, with blue-teaming recovering up to 90% on corresponding real geometry, closely aligning with simulation results.

Conclusion: GRT provides a general-purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation, exposing brittle failure modes and enabling targeted policy refinement through red-teaming and blue-teaming. The approach is validated in simulation and on a real robotic arm; results suggest meaningful improvements and practical utility.

Abstract: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy
performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight
into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric
Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through
object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes --
structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger
catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method
integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free,
simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation,
and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse
policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static
benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape
exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured,
object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally
show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as
blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those
shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the
utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we
validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm,
observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as
22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the
corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

*Evangelos Psomiadis,Panagiotis Tsiotras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Distributed event-triggered formation control for multi-agent systems using inter-agent distance measurements; reduces control updates by triggering on measurement error above threshold; stable and validated via simulations and real-world experiments; outperforms periodic triggering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce control effort and communication in resource-constrained multi-agent formation tasks while preserving formation accuracy and stability.

Method: A distributed event-triggered controller uses inter-agent distance measurements. Each agent updates control only when the local measurement error exceeds a predefined threshold; ensures stability and can handle various topologies and parameter variations; comparisons to periodic triggering.

Result: Significant reduction in control effort (fewer updates) with formation performance preserved; validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments across different formations, topologies, and parameter settings; scalability tests show robustness.

Conclusion: Event-triggered formation control is effective and resource-efficient for multi-agent systems, offering stability and accurate formation with reduced control updates, and is viable across topologies and parameter variations.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for
multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked
with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To
reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a
distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent
distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement
error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed
controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments involving different formations, communication topologies,
scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being
compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the
event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving
formation performance.

*Michael Lorenz,Bertram Taetz,Gabriele Bleser-Taetz,Didier Stricker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-time, calibration-free inertial tracking for a kinematic chain using minimal-state recursive Bayesian estimation, achieving drift-free relative and absolute orientation with a single IMU and fast joint-position convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inertial motion capture relies on offline calibrations (segment lengths, IMU-to-segment alignment, joint positions) which hampers convenient setup and real-time use.

Method: Simultaneous recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint positions expressed in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size, enabling real-time calibration-free tracking; validated on simulated a 3-link manipulator and re-simulated human walking data.

Result: The approach yields drift-free relative and absolute orientation with a global heading reference from only one IMU and demonstrates robust, fast convergence of joint-position estimates across different movement scenarios.

Conclusion: A lightweight, calibration-free algorithm enables real-time inertial tracking of a kinematic chain with minimal setup, suitable for out-of-lab applications.

Abstract: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside
the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods
require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of
the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between
inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment
calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup
process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable
calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous
recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint
positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on
simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as
well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study)
show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only
drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a
global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast
convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

### [212] [Computing forward statics from tendon-length in flexible-joint hyper-redundant manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12444)
*Weiting Feng,Kyle L. Walker,Yunjie Yang,Francesco Giorgio-Serchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A screw-based forward statics method for tendon-driven hyper-redundant manipulators reconciles tendon tension and length as inputs, enabling open-loop static control using purely kinematic input and reducing reliance on tension measurements or state estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, gravity-influenced hyper-redundant manipulators face a static force problem where controlling via tendon length is insufficient. Tension measurements or state estimation are often unavailable or unreliable, complicating control.

Method: Develop a screw-based forward statics formulation for a multi-segment, elastic-joint tendon-driven manipulator. Propose an iterative static solution that can accept either tendon length or tendon tension as input, and validate experimentally by first using tension control and then tendon-length control.

Result: The method enables open-loop static control using only kinematic input, bypassing the need for accurate tension measurement or state estimation, and demonstrates effectiveness when tendon lengths are used as inputs.

Conclusion: Reconciling tendon tension and length as inputs in forward statics provides a practical, experimentally validated approach for static control of large, elastic, hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators.

Abstract: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators offer greater flexibility and
compliance over traditional manipulators. A common way of controlling such
manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control
parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is
representative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with
manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a
static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping
from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,
measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust
tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement
or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not
always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables
tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.
We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,
hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics
iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length
or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a
traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the
method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the
possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic
input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension
measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A tiny sub-100g UAV uses a dual reconstruction pipeline—near-real-time SfM for adaptive flight and a non-real-time NeRF-based reconstruction (N3DR) fused with UWB poses—to achieve high-fidelity 3D scans of static objects; validated on Crazyflie 2.1 with single and multi-UAV setups; dynamic trajectories outperform static paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniature UAVs have severe payload/autonomy constraints, limiting their ability to perform high-quality 3D reconstruction in constrained environments. The work seeks autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning using ultra-light platforms that previously could only be done by larger drones.

Method: A dual pipeline: (1) near-real-time SfM to produce an instantaneous point cloud and assess model coverage, driving dynamic trajectory adaptation for improved data capture; (2) a non-real-time NeRF-based reconstruction (N3DR) that fuses SfM camera poses with Ultra-Wideband (UWB) localization for accurate final models. Implemented on Crazyflie 2.1, evaluated in single- and multi-UAV configurations.

Result: Dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. The architecture demonstrates a scalable, autonomous solution for miniaturized UAVs to achieve fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, validated experimentally with both single and multi-UAV setups.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of high-fidelity 3D reconstruction with sub-100g UAVs in indoor/constrained settings, expanding capabilities beyond larger platforms. It enables autonomous, high-quality 3D scanning on miniaturized hardware, though further work may address dynamic scenes and broader robustness.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for
navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in
payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like
high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,
high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100
grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates
a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A
near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model
quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently
capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data
acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline
employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)
approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)
location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this
architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both
single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory
adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight
paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks
the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in
constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger
platforms.

*Shipeng Liu,Meghana Sagare,Shubham Patil,Feifei Qian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tail oscillation of a mudskipper-inspired robot fluidizes granular substrates to boost flipper-driven locomotion; 67% speed increase, 46% drag reduction; tail morphology and substrate strength guide action strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable terrains (sand/mud) hinder terrestrial robots; inspiration from mudskippers to jointly optimize tail design and actuation to improve locomotion on granular media; broad applications in agriculture, search and rescue, and environmental exploration.

Method: Experimentally compare idle vs actively oscillating tail on a mudskipper-like robot; measure speed, body drag, and substrate shear forces to understand interaction; vary tail morphology (horizontal surface area) and analyze how oscillation affects insertion depth and resistance; derive design principle for tail action selection.

Result: Tail oscillation increased speed by 67% and reduced body drag by 46%; oscillation fluidizes substrate, reducing resistance; larger horizontal tail surface areas enhance the oscillation's benefits by limiting insertion depth; a design principle linking tail action to substrate strength and morphology.

Conclusion: Propose a design principle for selecting tail actions based on substrate strength and tail morphology; implications for improved locomotion on deformable substrates; potential applications in agricultural robotics, search and rescue, and environmental exploration.

Abstract: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for
terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by
mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and
movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design
and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media.
Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally
compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail
configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body
drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was
enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing
resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation
strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the
oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion
depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail
action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results
offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion
on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search

*Anna Deichler,Siyang Wang,Simon Alexanderson,Jonas Beskow*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imitation + reinforcement learning to generate natural pointing gestures for embodied agents; achieves higher naturalness and referential accuracy than supervised baselines, validated in VR with humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-verbal communication is crucial for natural human-agent interaction; existing work emphasizes verbal modes; need physically grounded, expressive gestures.

Method: Train a motor policy using imitation learning on a small motion capture dataset and refine with reinforcement learning to optimize referential accuracy; ensure gestures are physically valid and naturalistic; evaluate against supervised and retrieval baselines and in a VR referential game with humans.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art supervised models in naturalness and accuracy; demonstrates high referential accuracy and effective human-in-the-loop validation.

Conclusion: Imitation-RL is a promising approach for communicative gesture generation with potential applications to robotics.

Abstract: One of the main goals of robotics and intelligent agent research is to enable
natural communication with humans in physically situated settings. While recent
work has focused on verbal modes such as language and speech, non-verbal
communication is crucial for flexible interaction. We present a framework for
generating pointing gestures in embodied agents by combining imitation and
reinforcement learning. Using a small motion capture dataset, our method learns
a motor control policy that produces physically valid, naturalistic gestures
with high referential accuracy. We evaluate the approach against supervised
learning and retrieval baselines in both objective metrics and a virtual
reality referential game with human users. Results show that our system
achieves higher naturalness and accuracy than state-of-the-art supervised
models, highlighting the promise of imitation-RL for communicative gesture
generation and its potential application to robots.

*William Ward,Sarah Etter,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Christian Ellis,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An online adaptation framework for robotic control that uses function encoders and recursive least squares to adapt to abrupt dynamics shifts in real-time, enabling safer navigation with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots must operate safely in unstructured environments; abrupt terrain changes cause dynamics shifts that destabilize planners; need real-time model adaptation.

Method: Integrates function encoders (to capture dynamic function approximations) with recursive least squares to update encoder coefficients as latent states from streaming odometry; provides constant-time coefficient updates without gradient-based inner-loop optimization.

Result: Validated on Van der Pol system, Unity off-road sim, and real Clearpath Jackal on challenging ice rink terrain; shows improved model accuracy and downstream planning, reducing collisions vs static and meta-learning baselines.

Conclusion: This approach enables adaptation from only a few seconds of data, improving safety and performance in real-time robotic control.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within
seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such
as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize
planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online
adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares,
treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from
streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without
gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds
of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight
algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road
navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain
at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy
and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and
meta-learning baselines.

### [217] [Pre-trained Visual Representations Generalize Where it Matters in Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12531)
*Scott Jones,Liyou Zhou,Sebastian W. Pattinson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision models boost robustness of model-based visuomotor policies under visual domain shifts; partial fine-tuning yields best performance under extreme shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end visuomotor policies trained from pixels struggle with novel visuals; while model-based RL is sample-efficient, prior work found PVMs ineffective in MBRL; this work investigates whether PVMs can improve generalization under visual domain shifts in MBRL.

Method: Empirically evaluate PVMs in an MBRL framework under severe visual domain shifts, varying degrees of PVM fine-tuning (freeze, partial fine-tuning, full fine-tuning); compare against a baseline trained from scratch; measure robustness and task performance.

Result: PVMs outperform the scratch baseline under severe shifts; partial fine-tuning maintains the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts.

Conclusion: PVMs are highly effective for promoting robustness in visual policy learning within MBRL, supporting broader adoption of PVMs in model-based robotic learning.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is
derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and
vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel
visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy
network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent
developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is
more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has
found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness
in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show
that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline
model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying
levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can
maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in
promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence
for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.

### [218] [Robust Online Residual Refinement via Koopman-Guided Dynamics Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12562)
*Zhefei Gong,Shangke Lyu,Pengxiang Ding,Wei Xiao,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement) uses Koopman operator theory to impose linear dynamics in a latent space, guiding residual policy updates for imitation learning to improve long-horizon robustness and generalization. It conditions residual corrections on Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed action refinement in long-horizon robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision control due to compounding errors; residual learning typically focuses on local corrections without global state evolution awareness, limiting robustness and generalization. Global dynamics modeling can improve extrapolation and stability.

Method: Introduce KORR framework that learns Koopman-based linear dynamics in a latent space and conditions residual policy corrections on these latent predictions. This provides globally informed, stable action refinement for online residual learning, and is model-agnostic.

Result: Empirical evaluation on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture assembly with perturbations shows consistent performance gains, improved robustness, and better generalization over strong baselines.

Conclusion: Koopman-based global dynamics modeling can bridge modern learning approaches with classical control, enabling more robust, extrapolative residual refinement for imitation learning.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from
demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision
control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising,
model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop
corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections
to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which
limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we
propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy
updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear
time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state
transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen
environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a
simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on
Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action
refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture
assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent
gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our
findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge
modern learning methods with classical control theory.

### [219] [The Better You Learn, The Smarter You Prune: Towards Efficient Vision-language-action Models via Differentiable Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12594)
*Titong Jiang,Xuefeng Jiang,Yuan Ma,Xin Wen,Bailin Li,Kun Zhan,Peng Jia,Yahui Liu,Sheng Sun,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LightVLA presents an adaptive, differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models to boost efficiency and performance. It uses dynamic queries and Gumbel softmax for differentiable token selection, pruning less informative visual tokens while preserving task-relevant information. Notably, it requires no extra trainable parameters and outperforms baselines on LIBERO, reducing FLOPs by 59.1% and latency by 38.2% with a 2.9% higher task success rate; a variant LightVLA* with trainable parameters is also explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models achieve strong robotic task performance but are bottlenecked by heavy attention over large visual token sets, making deployment on resource-constrained platforms inefficient. There is a need for dynamic, data-driven token pruning that preserves task-relevant information while reducing computation.

Method: Propose LightVLA, which generates dynamic queries to assess token importance and uses Gumbel-softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through finetuning, the model learns to keep the most informative tokens and prune the rest. The design avoids heuristic constants and extra trainable parameters, ensuring compatibility with modern inference frameworks. An extended variant LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters is also studied.

Result: On LIBERO benchmark, LightVLA outperforms various VLA models and existing token pruning methods, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead: 59.1% FLOPs reduction and 38.2% latency reduction, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. LightVLA* with learnable parameters provides satisfactory performance.

Conclusion: LightVLA is among the first adaptive visual token pruning approaches for VLA tasks, achieving notable efficiency and performance gains without adding trainable parameters. This work advances real-time, practical robot systems by enabling efficient, capable VLA models and sets a foundation for further exploration of learnable, adaptive token pruning.

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning
framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown
impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment
on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy
attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA
addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual
tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and
adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through
fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens
while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby
improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires
no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,
making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results
demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token
pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher
success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,
LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%
improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable
query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable
parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that
as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune
tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks
with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant
step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

*Zekai Zhang,Weiye Zhu,Hewei Pan,Xiangchen Wang,Rongtao Xu,Xing Sun,Feng Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLN introduces a two-stage VLN framework enabling active, multi-turn RL with dynamic trajectory pruning; achieves large gains over imitation-learning baselines and competitive SOTA with a smaller model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based VLN methods rely heavily on imitation learning and post-training with DAgger or rely on RL methods that lack open-ended exploration and depend on expert-shaped rewards, limiting exploration of diverse navigation routes.

Method: Stage 1: bootstrap with imitation learning using a small fraction of expert trajectories. Stage 2: active RL where the agent predicts and executes actions to collect diverse trajectories, optimizing multiple rollouts with the GRPO objective. A dynamic early-stopping strategy prunes long-tail or likely failed trajectories, plus additional engineering optimizations.

Result: Experiments show ActiveVLN yields the largest performance gains over IL baselines among DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

Conclusion: ActiveVLN demonstrates effective active exploration via a two-stage training process, improving RL efficiency for VLN. Code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow
natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.
Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and
often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While
effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training
costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,
prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend
on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended
active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and
plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose
ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through
multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is
used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively
predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and
optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL
efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail
or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.
Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL
baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training
methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art
approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PerchMobi^3 is a quad-fan, negative-pressure robot that reuses fan power for aerial thrust and wall adhesion, integrated with four wheels for ground movement, enabling seamless ground-wall-air locomotion without separate pumps; a first prototype demonstrates multi-modal mobility and transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity, inefficiency, and reliability concerns of using dedicated adhesion actuators and pumps in multi-modal robots, by achieving a lightweight, compact design with integrated propulsion and adhesion.

Method: Design and build PerchMobi^3 with four ducted fans that provide both thrust and negative pressure, plus four actively driven wheels; develop a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse framework and a modeling/control system for coordinated ground, wall, and aerial operation with fan-assisted transitions; validate through experiments including ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial flight, and cross-mode transitions.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated: the quad-fan prototype successfully performs ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial flight, and transitions between modalities; eliminates the need for dedicated adhesion pumps, yielding a lightweight, compact design with robust cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: PerchMobi^3 represents a novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, offering potential pathways toward autonomous deployment and practical application-oriented use.

Abstract: Achieving seamless integration of aerial flight, ground driving, and wall
climbing within a single robotic platform remains a major challenge, as
existing designs often rely on additional adhesion actuators that increase
complexity, reduce efficiency, and compromise reliability. To address these
limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure,
air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse
mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial
thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively
driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a
lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal
locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation
across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The
feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of
experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial
flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across
locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a
novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for
future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UDON is a real-time multi-agent neural implicit mapping framework that maintains high-fidelity maps under extreme communication loss by using uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit multi-robot mapping is vulnerable to packet loss and limited bandwidth; existing methods underperform at very low communication success rates, limiting robustness in real-world networks.

Method:  UDON introduces an uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization that prioritizes reliable portions of the map and penalizes mapping disagreements between communicating agent pairs, enabling robust, real-time multi-agent mapping under severe communication deterioration.

Result: UDON outperforms baselines and preserves high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene representations even when communication success is as low as 1% on standard benchmarks and real hardware.

Conclusion:  UDON demonstrates a robust approach to multi-agent neural implicit mapping under extreme communication deterioration and shows promise for practical deployment in challenging network conditions.

Abstract: Multi-robot mapping with neural implicit representations enables the compact
reconstruction of complex environments. However, it demands robustness against
communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior
works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions,
performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success
rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit
mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed
optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication
deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of
the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping
disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot
hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing
baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene
representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1%
success rate).

*Kit-Wa Sou,Junhao Gong,Shoujie Li,Chuqiao Lyu,Ziwu Song,Shilong Mu,Wenbo Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A transparent dual-mode MoiréTac sensor uses overlapping micro-gratings to generate dense moiré patterns for simultaneous 6-DoF force/torque sensing, contact localization, and vision; end-to-end regression achieves high accuracy and tunable sensitivity; demonstrated on robotic cap-removal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuotactile sensing often relies on sparse markers and lacks a clear analytical force-to-image relationship. A high-resolution, optically clear surface that jointly supports tactile sensing and vision could enable more dexterous manipulation.

Method: Overlapping micro-gratings create moiré patterns when misaligned, preserving optical clarity while amplifying micro-deformations. Extract physics-based moiré features (brightness, phase gradient, orientation, period) and fuse with deep spatial features. Use end-to-end learning to map features to 6-axis force/torque. Tune sensitivity via geometric parameters; validate in manipulation tasks.

Result: R^2 > 0.98 for all force/torque axes; sensitivity adjustable by geometry (threefold gain); supports object classification despite moiré overlay; integrated into a robotic arm achieving coordinated force/torque control for cap removal.

Conclusion: MoiréTac delivers dense tactile sensing and vision on a transparent surface, with interpretable feature fusion and tunable sensitivity, enabling dexterous manipulation in robotics.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial
resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve
this problem, we present \textbf{Moir\'eTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates
dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent
architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moir\'e
patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical
clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moir\'e fields for tactile
sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact
localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features
(brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moir\'e patterns
with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque
measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning.
Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement
with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric
parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object
classification despite moir\'e overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a
robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control,
validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: NAMOUnc introduces an uncertainty-aware NAMO framework that estimates observation noise, model inaccuracies, action failures, and partial observability to compare time-cost intervals for removing versus bypassing obstacles, optimizing both success rate and time efficiency for safer navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world NAMO is challenged by uncertainties; existing solutions often assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal or risky decisions. A framework that explicitly models and reasons under uncertainty is needed to improve safety and efficiency.

Method: Propose NAMOUnc framework that estimates uncertainties and corresponding time-cost intervals for two strategies (remove vs bypass obstacles), and integrates these estimates into a decision-making policy that trades off safety (success probability) and time efficiency. Validation conducted via extensive simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements over existing NAMO frameworks in both simulated and real-world tests, with higher safety and/or efficiency metrics.

Conclusion: An uncertainty-aware NAMO framework can robustly handle observation noise, model errors, and action failures, improving safety and efficiency in cluttered, uncertain environments; the approach is validated, with scope for broader uncertainty modeling and future extensions.

Abstract: Navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) is a critical task in robotics,
often challenged by real-world uncertainties such as observation noise, model
approximations, action failures, and partial observability. Existing solutions

This paper introduces NAMOUnc, a novel framework designed to address these
uncertainties by integrating them into the decision-making process. We first
estimate them and compare the corresponding time cost intervals for removing
and bypassing obstacles, optimizing both the success rate and time efficiency,
ensuring safer and more efficient navigation. We validate our method through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal management and reliability in robotic manipulators are hampered by the difficulty of deriving, identifying, and validating large parametric models. A data-driven, model-free approach can better handle complexity and uncertainty and scale to many joints.

Method: Train multi-hidden-layer DNNs with LSTM and feedforward components on collected sensed joint torque data to forecast motor temperatures, thereby capturing temperature dynamics without an explicit physical model, validated on a seven-joint redundant robot.

Result: The approach yields promising predictive results for the temperature dynamics of joint motors, indicating effective modeling of thermal behavior in a complex robotic system.

Conclusion: A scalable, model-free ML approach can effectively predict motor temperature dynamics in complex manipulators, offering a viable alternative to parametric models for thermal management and control.

Abstract: In this work, deep neural networks made up of multiple hidden Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and Feedforward layers are trained to predict the thermal
behavior of the joint motors of robot manipulators. A model-free and scalable
approach is adopted. It accommodates complexity and uncertainty challenges
stemming from the derivation, identification, and validation of a large number
of parameters of an approximation model that is hardly available. To this end,
sensed joint torques are collected and processed to foresee the thermal
behavior of joint motors. Promising prediction results of the machine learning
based capture of the temperature dynamics of joint motors of a redundant robot
with seven joints are presented.

*Eric Guiffo Kaigom*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a smart digital twin framework using variational autoencoders to monitor and forecast motor-thermal saturation, enabling autonomous, thermally feasible task planning without shutdowns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for resilient, human-centric automation that maintains performance under thermal stress and extends robot lifetime in Industry 4.0/5.0 and beyond.

Method: Leverages generative AI (VAEs) within smart digital twins to model thermally anomalous states; defines a thermal difficulty score from VAE reconstruction error; uses this to predict/communicate feasibility of motion profiles.

Result: Conceptual framework with demonstration of thermally aware self-sustaining behavior; no explicit experimental results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Enables autonomous anticipation and sharing of thermal feasibility for Industry 6.0/Society 6.0 tasks, potentially reducing unintended shutdowns and improving resilience.

Abstract: Robots are unrelentingly used to achieve operational efficiency in Industry
4.0 along with symbiotic and sustainable assistance for the work-force in
Industry 5.0. As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in
anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous
anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors
overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots
are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user
experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in
advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their
lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown,
when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories
and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement
after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with
generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage
thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal
difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational
autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the
thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from
emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

TL;DR: Robot-assisted dressing system robust to partial observations and arm movements; fine-tunes a simulation-trained policy in real-world with limited data and multimodal feedback, achieving successful dressing of long-sleeve garments across 12 participants (264 trials) and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dressing with robots must cope with deformable garments, contact forces, and changing limb positions; current work often assumes static limbs, limiting real-world applicability; need robust, safe, and adaptable solutions under occlusions.

Method: Train policy in simulation with partial observations; fine-tune in real world using small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing; evaluate with simplified articulated meshes in simulation and real-world study; assess adaptability to arm motions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of robot-assisted dressing under realistic conditions with partial observations and limb motion; supports potential for assistive technology, with room for improvement in safety, generalization to more garments, and longer-term use.

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives
of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and
comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging
deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements
throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions
-- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world
applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system
capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as
robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy
trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to
fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal
feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's
adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in
simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human
study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully
dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being
adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior
baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback. Video are available at

### [229] [NavMoE: Hybrid Model- and Learning-based Traversability Estimation for Local Navigation via Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12747)
*Botao He,Amir Hossein Shahidzadeh,Yu Chen,Jiayi Wu,Tianrui Guan,Guofei Chen,Howie Choset,Dinesh Manocha,Glen Chou,Cornelia Fermuller,Yiannis Aloimonos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NAVMOE is a hierarchical mixture-of-experts framework for traversability estimation and local navigation that adaptively fuses specialized terrain-specific models (static or learning-based) via a gating network, enabling cross-domain generalization and dramatic efficiency gains from a training-free lazy gating, with a two-stage training process to handle nondifferentiable modules; achieves 81.2% reduction in computation with <2% path-quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traversability estimation for robot navigation requires reliable predictions encoding geometry and semantics across diverse environments, while being computationally efficient.

Method: NAVMOE is a modular, hierarchical mixture-of-experts approach where experts are terrain-type-specific models (classical or learning-based). A gating network dynamically weights their contributions based on the input environment. A training-free lazy gating mechanism minimizes the number of activated experts during inference. A two-stage training strategy enables training of the gating networks despite nondifferentiable modules within the hybrid MoE.

Result: Experiments show NAVMOE yields better efficiency and performance balance than any single expert or full ensemble across domains; improves cross-domain generalization; reduces average computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating with less than 2% loss in path quality.

Conclusion: NAVMOE demonstrates that adaptive specialization with lazy gating and two-stage training can deliver robust traversability estimation with high efficiency and generalization, suitable for diverse navigation scenarios. Further work could address scalability, real-world deployment, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key
bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable
and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic
information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of
Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability
estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models
for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based
or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain
types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based
on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers
three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively
leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances
generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach
significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by
introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to
minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach
uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating
networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules.
Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and
performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across
different domains, improving cross- domain generalization and reducing average
computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path
quality.

*Saki Hashimoto,Shoichi Hasegawa,Tomochika Ishikawa,Akira Taniguchi,Yoshinobu Hagiwara,Lotfi El Hafi,Tadahiro Taniguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActOwL enables robots to actively query ownership-related questions to learn object ownership with high information gain; uses a probabilistic generative model and LLM-based commonsense, achieving better ownership clustering with fewer questions in simulations and real-world labs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ownership understanding is crucial for correctly following instructions in domestic/office settings; visual cues alone are insufficient; socially appropriate behavior requires knowing object ownership.

Method: Introduce ActOwL: probabilistic generative model to select questions maximizing information gain; LLM-guided commonsense to pre-classify objects as shared or owned; only owned objects targeted; experiments in simulated home and real-world lab.

Result: Higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baselines; demonstrates effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: ActOwL advances robotics' ability to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution; potential for improved integration and efficiency in real-world use.

Abstract: Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge
for practical and socially appropriate task execution.

*Renjie Wang,Shangke Lyu,Xin Lang,Wei Xiao,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid TO+RL framework for safe adaptive landing on rough terrains for quadrupeds, coupling trajectory optimization with learning-based tracking and a reward relaxation strategy to promote exploration during landing recovery; validated by extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quadruped jumping work largely assumes flat-ground landing and neglects rough terrains; there is a need for robust, adaptive landing on uneven surfaces.

Method: Use Trajectory Optimization (TO) to generate reference landing trajectories; train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to track the TO reference and handle rough terrain; introduce a reward relaxation strategy during the landing recovery phase to encourage exploration and compliant behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments validate accurate tracking of the TO reference and safe landing on rough terrains across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed safe landing framework combines TO and RL with a reward relaxation mechanism to achieve adaptive, safe landings on rough terrains for quadruped robots, addressing limitations of flat-ground assumptions.

Abstract: Jumping constitutes an essential component of quadruped robots' locomotion
capabilities, which includes dynamic take-off and adaptive landing. Existing
quadrupedal jumping studies mainly focused on the stance and flight phase by
assuming a flat landing ground, which is impractical in many real world cases.
This work proposes a safe landing framework that achieves adaptive landing on
rough terrains by combining Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement
Learning (RL) together. The RL agent learns to track the reference motion
generated by TO in the environments with rough terrains. To enable the learning
of compliant landing skills on challenging terrains, a reward relaxation
strategy is synthesized to encourage exploration during landing recovery
period. Extensive experiments validate the accurate tracking and safe landing
skills benefiting from our proposed method in various scenarios.

*Bowen Ye,Junyue Huang,Yang Liu,Xiaozhen Qiao,Xiang Yin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable, structure-aware MoE planner (S-MSP) for STL-constrained task and motion planning that uses synchronized multi-view observations to produce feasible trajectories; includes a safety-filter; outperforms single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STL planning in unstructured real-world environments lacks effective use of maps; need to integrate perception, planning, and STL robustness without reliance on predefined mobility representations.

Method: Structured-MoE STL Planner (S-MSP) with a differentiable pipeline mapping multi-view observations and an STL spec to a feasible trajectory; composite loss combining trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness; structure-aware MoE enabling horizon-aware sub-task specialization via temporally anchored embeddings; safety filter at inference to improve executability.

Result: In high-fidelity factory-logistics simulations with temporally constrained tasks, S-MSP outperforms single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility; a rule-based safety filter at inference improves physical executability without compromising logical correctness.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practical integration of perception, planning, and safety for STL-constrained task and motion planning in unstructured environments, showing improved feasibility and correctness over baselines.

Abstract: We investigate the task and motion planning problem for Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) specifications in robotics. Existing STL methods rely on pre-defined maps
or mobility representations, which are ineffective in unstructured real-world
environments. We propose the \emph{Structured-MoE STL Planner}
(\textbf{S-MSP}), a differentiable framework that maps synchronized multi-view
camera observations and an STL specification directly to a feasible trajectory.
S-MSP integrates STL constraints within a unified pipeline, trained with a
composite loss that combines trajectory reconstruction and STL robustness. A
\emph{structure-aware} Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model enables horizon-aware
specialization by projecting sub-tasks into temporally anchored embeddings. We
evaluate S-MSP using a high-fidelity simulation of factory-logistics scenarios
with temporally constrained tasks. Experiments show that S-MSP outperforms
single-expert baselines in STL satisfaction and trajectory feasibility. A
rule-based \emph{safety filter} at inference improves physical executability
without compromising logical correctness, showcasing the practicality of the
approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that uses LLMs and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and assign them to multiple robots based on their on-site spatial knowledge, enabling robust multi-robot task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle instructions requiring searching for multiple objects and context-dependent commands in a robotic setting by optimally distributing subtasks among robots with localized knowledge, thereby improving success rates and execution efficiency.

Method: Introduce a novel few-shot prompting strategy for LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands, decompose into subtasks, and allocate them to robots. Integrates spatial concepts learned by each robot to guide task allocation, followed by sequential planning and execution. Validated with experiments showing improved assignment accuracy and qualitative tests on real robots.

Result: Achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based (26/50) baselines. Qualitative evaluations with two real mobile manipulators demonstrated handling of ad hoc categories (e.g., 'Get ready for a field trip') through effective decomposition, assignment, planning, and execution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables robust multi-robot instruction following by leveraging LLMs for natural language understanding and spatial concepts for subtask allocation, with demonstrated effectiveness in both synthetic benchmarks and real-robot experiments; suggests potential for broader applicability and future improvements in coordination and adaptability.

Abstract: It is crucial to efficiently execute instructions such as "Find an apple and
a banana" or "Get ready for a field trip," which require searching for multiple
objects or understanding context-dependent commands. This study addresses the
challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part
of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site
knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it
by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions
into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel
few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from
ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our
experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments,
outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50).
Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile
manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle
instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready
for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment,
sequential planning, and execution.

### [234] [Unleashing the Power of Discrete-Time State Representation: Ultrafast Target-based IMU-Camera Spatial-Temporal Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12846)
*Junlin Song,Antoine Richard,Miguel Olivares-Mendez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an extremely efficient calibration method for visual-inertial systems using discrete-time state representation to replace the common but costly continuous-time (B-spline) approach, addressing both spatial and temporal calibration challenges, with open-source code planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatial-temporal calibration between IMU and cameras is essential for reliable visual-inertial fusion. Continuous-time state representations (e.g., B-splines) achieve precision but are computationally expensive, hindering large-scale deployment (e.g., calibrating millions of devices).

Method: Introduce a novel calibration framework based on discrete-time state representation to perform spatial and temporal calibration more efficiently, along with strategies to mitigate the weaknesses of discrete-time methods in temporal calibration.

Result: Claims extremely efficient calibration with substantial reduction in computation time compared to continuous-time methods, maintaining accuracy, and addressing temporal calibration challenges.

Conclusion: The work aims to accelerate widespread adoption by providing open-source code, benefiting both research and industry by enabling fast calibration for large-scale deployments.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and
autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To
bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal
displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most
existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more
specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise
spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused
by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and
extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of
discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time
state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the
increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial
platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one
minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.
To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be
open-source.

*Antoine Lénat,Olivier Cheminat,Damien Chablat,Camilo Charron*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrating predicate-logic-based skill description with cognitive architectures to model operator adaptation and skill transfer in welding under Industry 5.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to formalize operator skills and compare performance with/without robot assistance; address cognitive constraints (timing, resources, parallelization, automatic gestures) overlooked by pure logical approaches.

Method: Proposes a synthesis of Vergnaud's scheme within Piaget's framework with cognitive-architecture models; applies to welding as a case study; discusses a perception–decision–action loop and the evaluation lag in weld quality.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework and analysis; no empirical results; demonstrates feasibility and identifies key design considerations for integrating skill descriptions with cognitive architectures; highlights promises and gaps.

Conclusion: Cognitive-architecture–based extension of scheme theory can better capture operator skills and transfer to robotic assistance; requires empirical validation in welding contexts and Industry 5.0 scenarios.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction is increasingly important in industry, and this
trend will only intensify with the rise of Industry 5.0. Human operators have
skills that need to be adapted when using machines to achieve the best results.
It is crucial to highlight the operator's skills and understand how they use
and adapt them [18]. A rigorous description of these skills is necessary to
compare performance with and without robot assistance. Predicate logic, used by
Vergnaud within Piaget's scheme concept, offers a promising approach. However,
this theory doesn't account for cognitive system constraints, such as the
timing of actions, the limitation of cognitive resources, the parallelization
of tasks, or the activation of automatic gestures contrary to optimal
knowledge. Integrating these constraints is essential for representing agent
skills understanding skill transfer between biological and mechanical
structures. Cognitive architectures models [2] address these needs by
describing cognitive structure and can be combined with the scheme for mutual
benefit. Welding provides a relevant case study, as it highlights the
challenges faced by operators, even highly skilled ones. Welding's complexity
stems from the need for constant skill adaptation to variable parameters like
part position and process. This adaptation is crucial, as weld quality, a key
factor, is only assessed afterward via destructive testing. Thus, the welder is
confronted with a complex perception-decision-action cycle, where the
evaluation of the impact of his actions is delayed and where errors are
definitive. This dynamic underscores the importance of understanding and
modeling the skills of operators.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proprioceptive RL gains proactive, perception-like awareness via contrastive learning to estimate privileged simulation information, enabling adaptive gait timing and robust sim-to-real humanoid locomotion without deploying a full perception stack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resolve the long-standing trade-off in locomotion control between robust, reactive proprioceptive policies and proactive perception-driven systems, by enabling foresight without perception-time costs.

Method: A contrastive learning framework that distills privileged environmental information from simulation into the actor's latent state, creating 'distilled awareness' that drives an adaptive gait clock and proactive pacing based on terrain understanding.

Result: Zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a full-sized humanoid achieving robust locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm steps and 26.5-degree slopes.

Conclusion: The approach merges clocked, predictable gait with flexible, proactive policies, showing that proactive proprioception can be achieved without a full perception pipeline, improving robustness and deployment viability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid
locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment:
policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control
or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper
resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely
proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of
perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a
contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode
privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this
``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to
proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the
terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked
gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust
locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg}
slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method. Website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRATE uses a Graph Transformer-based DRL planner for autonomous robot exploration, plus Kalman-filter smoothing for kinodynamically feasible paths, achieving faster exploration. Validated in simulation and real-world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods on collision-free graphs struggle to reason over graph-structured data and often optimize for distance rather than time, neglecting kinodynamics. There is a need for stronger global/local graph reasoning and feasible trajectories.

Method: Introduce a Graph Transformer to encode informative graphs; train a DRL policy for exploration decisions; apply a Kalman filter to smooth waypoint outputs to ensure kinodynamic feasibility; evaluate on simulation benchmarks and real-world tests.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in exploration efficiency: up to 21.5% shorter distance and 21.3% faster time to complete exploration; demonstrated in real-world validation.

Conclusion: GRATE demonstrates improved graph-structured reasoning and kinodynamic feasibility, enhancing ARE performance and practicality.

Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously
navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making
problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods
often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data.
Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting
RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while
neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph
Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global
contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's
reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a
Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path
is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5%
in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art
conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We
also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: Pointing is a key robot interaction mode, but prior work emphasizes recognition over generation; motivating a dataset and controllers that generate natural pointing for improved human-robot collaboration.

Method: Construct a motion capture dataset of pointing gestures capturing diverse styles, handedness, and targets. Use reinforcement learning with motion imitation to train policies that reproduce human-like pointing while optimizing precision.

Result: Policies reproduce human-like pointing and enable context-aware pointing behaviors in simulation, balancing task performance with natural dynamics.

Conclusion: The combination of dataset and imitation-based RL offers a viable path for generating natural, task-focused pointing gestures, with potential applications in human-robot interaction; future work could transfer to real robots and broader contexts.

Abstract: Pointing is a key mode of interaction with robots, yet most prior work has
focused on recognition rather than generation. We present a motion capture

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes time-normalized Responsibility and a new Engagement metric to quantify how agents share and intensify conflicts in social robot navigation (SRN), validated through simulations across dyadic, group, and crowd scenarios to assess cooperative resolution and foresightedness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In SRN, meaningful evaluation metrics are essential for assessing human-robot interactions, especially how conflicts are resolved and how each agent contributes to resolution.

Method: Extend the existing Responsibility metric with a time normalization to model conflict buildup, and introduce an Engagement metric for how agents' actions intensify conflicts. Validate the metrics via comprehensive simulations of dyadic, group, and crowd interactions. Discuss applicability, design choices, and limitations.

Result: The proposed metrics carry meaningful information about the cooperative resolution of conflicts and can be used to assess behavior quality and foresightedness in social navigation.

Conclusion: The work advances metric design for SRN, offering tools to evaluate cooperation, but also emphasizes considerations on applicability, design choices, and inherent limitations.

Abstract: In Social Robot Navigation (SRN), the availability of meaningful metrics is
crucial for evaluating trajectories from human-robot interactions. In the SRN
context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or
more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the
resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work,
which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this
framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by
introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement
metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a
comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd
interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the
cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess
behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability,
design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SRN evaluation metrics fail to quantify cooperation and shared responsibility in interactions with humans, hindering standardized assessment of safety, efficiency, and social acceptance.

Method: Introduce two metrics—conflict intensity and responsibility—to quantify how much an algorithm reduces conflict and which agent bears responsibility for resolution, demonstrated in a simple frontal approach scenario.

Result: The metrics provide a way to measure both the degree of contributed conflict reduction by an algorithm and the responsible agent in resolution, facilitating comprehensive evaluation of HRI quality.

Conclusion: Aims to establish standardized SRN evaluation methodology to improve safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in human-centric environments.

Abstract: Establishing standardized metrics for Social Robot Navigation (SRN)
algorithms for assessing the quality and social compliance of robot behavior
around humans is essential for SRN research. Currently, commonly used
evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent
behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach
scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one
agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To
address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity
metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of
evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given
algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took
responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the
development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN,
ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in
human-centric environments.

### [241] [Spatiotemporal Calibration for Laser Vision Sensor in Hand-eye System Based on Straight-line Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12928)
*Peiwen Yang,Mingquan Jiang,Xinyue Shen,Heping Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A teaching-free spatiotemporal calibration method for laser vision sensors in welding that accounts for camera time-offset and hand-eye extrinsics by enforcing straight-line (Plucker) constraints on weld measurements, optimized with Levenberg–Marquardt; validated on curved welds and open-sourced resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera communication delay creates temporal desynchronization between LVS images and robot motion; hand-eye extrinsics can drift over time during prolonged measurement; together they degrade welding data accuracy, necessitating a robust, teaching-free calibration approach.

Method: Introduce a measurement model that incorporates the camera time-offset. Propose a spatiotemporal calibration using straight-line constraints: a robot with LVS scans straight-line fillet welds along S-shaped trajectories; through Plucker coordinates, all welding positions lie on a common straight line regardless of orientation. Formulate a nonlinear optimization problem with straight-line constraints and solve with Levenberg–Marquardt to estimate time-offset, hand-eye extrinsics, and line parameters.

Result: Feasibility and accuracy demonstrated through experiments on curved weld scanning. The approach effectively estimates time-offset and extrinsic parameters while maintaining the straight-line constraint; resources (code, dataset, simulation report) are open-sourced at the provided URL.

Conclusion: The proposed teaching-free spatiotemporal calibration using Plücker straight-line constraints provides a robust solution to LVS time-offset and hand-eye drift in welding applications, enabling accurate geometric data across varying robot orientations. Open-source resources facilitate replication and adoption.

Abstract: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial
robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in
welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a
temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions.
Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged
measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS
considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free
spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method
involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet
welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation
changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line,
represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model
based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters,
including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line
parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are
quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We

*Jae-Hyun Lee,Jonghoo Park,Kyu-Jin Cho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An anthropomorphic underactuated hand uses tendon-based proprioception via SEAs to enable proprioceptive-aware grasping without vision or tactile feedback; estimates contact timing, joint angles, object stiffness, and finger configuration changes to support grasp posture reconstruction and safe handling, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underactuated hands are compact and versatile but suffer from limited sensing; integrating compact proprioception aligned with underactuation is critical for robust hand-object interaction without heavy reliance on vision or tactile sensing.

Method: Develop a compact series elastic actuator (SEA) integrated into sensorless fingers to provide tendon-based proprioception; couple this proprioception with a potential-energy–based model to estimate grasp-relevant variables such as contact timing, joint angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating external disturbances; use these estimates for grasp-posture reconstruction, safe manipulation of deformables, and blind grasping with proprioceptive-only object recognition.

Result: Experiments at finger and hand levels demonstrate effective estimation of grasp variables and successful demonstrations of manipulation; tendon-based proprioception is shown to be a compact, robust sensing modality enabling manipulation without vision or tactile feedback.

Conclusion: Tendon-based proprioception offers a viable, compact sensing modality for practical manipulation in anthropomorphic underactuated hands, enabling proprioceptive-only recognition across varying geometry and stiffness and supporting safe handling of deformable objects.

Abstract: Anthropomorphic underactuated hands are widely employed for their versatility
and structural simplicity. In such systems, compact sensing integration and
proper interpretation aligned with underactuation are crucial for realizing
practical grasp functionalities. This study proposes an anthropomorphic
underactuated hand that achieves comprehensive situational awareness of
hand-object interaction, utilizing tendon-based proprioception provided by
series elastic actuators (SEAs). We developed a compact SEA with high accuracy
and reliability that can be seamlessly integrated into sensorless fingers. By
coupling proprioceptive sensing with potential energy-based modeling, the
system estimates key grasp-related variables, including contact timing, joint
angles, relative object stiffness, and finger configuration changes indicating
external disturbances. These estimated variables enable grasp posture
reconstruction, safe handling of deformable objects, and blind grasping with
proprioceptive-only recognition of objects with varying geometry and stiffness.
Finger-level experiments and hand-level demonstrations confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that
tendon-based proprioception serves as a compact and robust sensing modality for
practical manipulation without reliance on vision or tactile feedback.

*Erblin Isaku,Hassan Sartaj,Shaukat Ali,Beatriz Sanguino,Tongtong Wang,Guoyuan Li,Houxiang Zhang,Thomas Peyrucain*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A digital twin–based approach (ODiSAR) for detecting out-of-distribution events in self-adaptive robots, using a Transformer twin for state forecasting, reconstruction error, and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty, plus an explainability layer to map OOD to specific states; evaluated on two industrial robots with high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-adaptive robots in uncertain environments require proactive detection of abnormal and OOD behaviors. Digital twins provide a controllable, forecastable proxy to identify deviations and support timely self-adaptation.

Method: Construct a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states (trajetories/motions). Detect OOD via reconstruction error plus predictive variance from Monte Carlo dropout. Use an explainability layer linking potential OOD to specific SAR states to aid interpretation and self-adaptation.

Result: ODiSAR achieved high detection performance: up to 98% AUROC, 96% TNR@TPR95, and 95% F1-score, on digital twins of two robots (office navigation and maritime navigation), with interpretable insights for adaptation.

Conclusion: A Transformer-based digital twin with reconstruction error, predictive uncertainty, and explainability effectively detects OOD in SARs and supports proactive self-adaptation, even under unseen conditions.

Abstract: Self-adaptive robots (SARs) in complex, uncertain environments must
proactively detect and address abnormal behaviors, including
out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. To this end, digital twins offer a valuable
solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for
OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to
forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout
for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with
predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even
in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an
explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering
insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of
two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another
performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR
behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects
OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance
-- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing
interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.

### [244] [DVDP: An End-to-End Policy for Mobile Robot Visual Docking with RGB-D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13024)
*Haohan Min,Zhoujian Li,Yu Yang,Jinyu Chen,Shenghai Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: End-to-end visual docking policy (DVDP) uses a binocular RGB-D camera to directly output docking trajectories, enabling flexible, precise docking without strict initial pose constraints; it is trained and evaluated on a large synthetic-real dataset and validated on a real robot (SCOUT Mini).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual docking offers high precision and low deployment costs but current vision-based solutions require strict initial positioning and struggle with end-to-end control. There is a need for a truly autonomous, end-to-end visual docking method that can output feasible docking paths directly from sensor input.

Method: An end-to-end policy, DVDP, takes binocular RGB-D input and outputs docking trajectories. The authors built a large-scale dataset combining Unity 3D-based virtual environments with real robot setups, and evaluated DVDP against perception backbones integrated into their framework using a set of custom metrics. They also performed real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini to validate trajectory feasibility and adherence to physical constraints.

Result: DVDP achieved superior performance compared to adapted perception backbones, produced smooth and feasible docking trajectories, respected physical constraints, and successfully reached the target pose in real-world tests on SCOUT Mini.

Conclusion: End-to-end visual docking via DVDP is effective for autonomous docking, reducing dependence on initial pose accuracy and offering a practical trajectory output suitable for real-world deployment; the dataset and evaluation framework support robust benchmarking and further improvements may focus on generalization and integration with diverse platforms.

Abstract: Automatic docking has long been a significant challenge in the field of
mobile robotics. Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking
methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an
efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods
impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the
docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods,
we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct
visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera
installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path,
achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a
large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a
combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and
actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to
quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive
experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted
into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.
Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy,
with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet
physical constraints and reach the target pose.

*James C. Ward,Arthur Richards,Edmund R. Hunt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decentralized online multi-robot patrol that adapts to dynamic environments to minimize visit times, outperforming baselines in dynamic settings and examining when dynamics modeling is optional.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent monitoring is needed in security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. A fully online decentralized approach offers robustness, adaptability, and scalability, potentially enabling real-time adaptation to changing environments.

Method: Proposes a new method for monitoring and adjusting for environment dynamics within a decentralized multi-robot patrol team. Operates online, uses observations of route traversability, and allows agents to adjust patrol routes in real time to minimize the time between visits to points of interest.

Result: The method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic scenarios and is also evaluated in dynamic scenarios where explicitly accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

Conclusion: A fully online decentralized patrol approach can deliver robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments, with potential benefits even when accurate dynamic models are unavailable or impractical to obtain.

Abstract: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as
security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such
monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential
advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring
solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in
real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of
multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise
time between visits to points of interest, within environments where
traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by
patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In
this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment
dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic
scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly
accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 16-DoF SABD hand uses a single, high-range Add/Abd joint for digits 4–5 to expand the grasp envelope, reduce DoFs, and enable stable grasps of larger, non-anthropomorphic objects (86% teleoperation success on YCB set).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend grasp capabilities beyond traditional anthropomorphic hand designs while reducing actuation complexity and maintaining dexterity.

Method: Introduce a combined Add/Abd joint for digits 4 and 5 with a large motion range to expand the workspace; assess grasp envelope; perform reinforcement-learning-based policy studies; conduct teleoperation trials on YCB objects.

Result: Workspace increased by 400%; the combined joint supports side distances up to 200 mm; RL policies enable grasping of larger/nonstandard objects and enhance stability; teleoperation trials achieved 86% success on suitable YCB objects.

Conclusion: The integrated Add/Abd joint yields enhanced stability, flexibility, and dexterous manipulation without added mechanical complexity, broadening potential applications.

Abstract: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand
that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp
envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the
required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the
adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint
with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the
digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the
hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement
learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies
that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving
enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully
performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including
challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the
design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous
manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range
of applications.

### [247] [A Design Co-Pilot for Task-Tailored Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13077)
*Jonathan Külz,Sehoon Ha,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable, generative design framework that tailors modular robot morphologies to a specific environment by learning inverse kinematics and enabling gradient-based optimization, dramatically reducing design time and enabling rapid adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot manufacturers use one-size-fits-all manipulators that underperform in specialized tasks. Custom, task-tailored robots suffer from long, costly development cycles and hardware costs. Modular robots offer quick adaptation, and differentiable design methods can automate morphology and IK optimization for specific settings.

Method: Train inverse kinematics across a wide range of manipulators within a fully differentiable framework. Use gradient-based optimization to fine-tune both the robot design (morphology) and the IK solutions. Employ a generative design approach to accelerate synthesis from hours to seconds, functioning as a design co-pilot. Validate on tasks such as navigating cluttered environments and adapting to hardware constraints, including a real-world-like modular robot in simulation moving through an obstacle course.

Result: The approach yields robot morphologies that can navigate cluttered environments and maintain good performance across specified workspaces while adapting to hardware constraints. Design time is significantly shortened (seconds rather than hours), and real-world applicability is demonstrated via simulation-based obstacle-course experiments for a modular robot.

Conclusion: The framework enables instant adaptation and productive human-AI collaboration for rapid, task-specific robot design. It promises broader impact by enabling fast generation of custom morphologies for varying environments and hardware limits.

Abstract: Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SeqWM is a sequential, agent-wise world-model framework for multi-agent MBRL that decomposes joint dynamics, uses sequential communication to plan and share intentions, achieves linear communication overhead, and shows state-of-the-art performance in simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the difficulty of modeling joint dynamics in multi-robot systems and to improve sample efficiency and planning, while reducing communication demands and enabling explicit coordination.

Method: Construct independent agent-wise world models arranged sequentially; perform latent rollouts; agents forecast futures and plan actions conditioned on predecessors; share intentions explicitly; achieve linear communication complexity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (model-free and model-based) on Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad; better overall performance and sample efficiency; demonstrates advanced cooperative behaviors; transferred to real robots (quadrupeds); code demos available.

Conclusion: SeqWM provides a scalable, effective framework for cooperative MBRL with real-world applicability; demonstrates both simulation and real-world success; suggests potential for broader tasks and future enhancements.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in
robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However,
extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the
complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World
Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into
model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent,
sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint
dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential
communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its
actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables
explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces
communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated
environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing
state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall
performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative
behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM
has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-layer learning-based control framework combines MPC with a disturbance observer and Bayesian optimization to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms via a soft robotic actuator, validated on a brain phantom; shows large reductions in tracking errors and rapid online learning of ICP-targeting motor trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modulating ICP waveforms is important for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and neurological disorders, but achieving safe, accurate control is challenging due to nonlinear ICP–motor coupling and safety constraints.

Method: A two-layer control scheme: (1) MPC with a disturbance observer for offset-free motor position tracking under safety constraints; (2) Bayesian optimization to learn online a motor trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation despite unknown nonlinear ICP dependence.

Result: Compared to a PID controller, the MPC reduced mean motor position tracking error by 83% and maximum error by 73%. The Bayesian optimization learned a motor trajectory in under 20 iterations that achieves the target ICP waveform mean and amplitude.

Conclusion: The proposed two-layer framework enables safe, data-efficient control of ICP modulation with a soft actuator, achieving accurate motor tracking and rapid, online adaptation to nonlinear ICP dynamics in vitro; promising for CSF dynamics research and related neurological studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic
actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms,
which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological
processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed
to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive
controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking
of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints.
Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor
position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online
learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP
modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a
brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a
previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC
reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and
73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor
position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean
and amplitude.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient differentiable non-holonomic hydroelastic model for passive-compliant tactile sensors that captures path-dependent contact forces and surface-area variation, enabling gradient-based trajectory optimization with tactile feedback; validated in simulation and real experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensor compliance introduces nonlinear, path-dependent dynamics that are not well captured by rigid or naïve models; capturing these effects is crucial for accurate contact reasoning and optimization in manipulation tasks.

Method: Develop a computationally efficient non-holonomic hydroelastic model that explicitly extends the object's state space to include distributed forces from the compliant sensor, and provide a differentiable formulation that supports gradient-based trajectory optimization and integration with high-resolution tactile data.

Result: The approach accurately models path-dependent contact force distributions and surface-area variations, demonstrated across simulated and real-world experiments, improving predictive capability and optimization performance.

Conclusion: Modeling the path dependence of sensor dynamics is essential for tactile-enabled manipulation, and the proposed framework offers a practical, differentiable tool for integrating compliant tactile sensing into planning and control.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities,
offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot
and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of
force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to
capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant
elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic
hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force
distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the
object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated
by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for
path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory
optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and
real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path
dependence of sensor dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Uncertainty-weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT) uses a frozen teacher to estimate per-token entropy and weights the student loss, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous driving in roundabouts via multi-channel BEV grids and transformer sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle the imbalance between common low-risk states and rare high-risk safety decisions in autonomous driving, and to robustly reason over spatial-temporal information under uncertainty.

Method: Integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling. A frozen teacher transformer provides per-token predictive entropy to weight the student model's loss, emphasizing uncertain, high-impact states while stabilizing learning on low-risk transitions.

Result: In a roundabout simulator across varying traffic densities, UWDT outperforms baselines in reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.

Motivation: There is a need for extensive, diverse, safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving. Real-world data collection is costly and dangerous, while simulator data often suffers from sim-to-real gaps. A scalable, geographically aware data synthesis pipeline can bridge this gap and support training and evaluation across the world.

Method: From an arbitrary location, retrieve real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial sources; simulate agent behaviors using naturalistic driving datasets; orchestrate diverse adversities to create corner cases; use street-view information to drive photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via Cosmos-Drive; integrate agent and sensor simulations to generate training/evaluation data for E2E driving.

Conclusion: TeraSim-World bridges agent and sensor simulations to deliver a scalable, globally applicable data synthesis platform, helping to reduce sim-to-real gaps and facilitate safer, broader E2E autonomous driving development.

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires
extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data
are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or
collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents
TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and
geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at
anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World
retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources.
Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and
orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street
views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical and safety barriers limit real data collection; realistic training/test environments and autonomy algorithms require realistic imaging and feedback; ROOM enables scalable, diverse data generation for bronchoscopy.

Method: A pipeline that uses patient CT scans to render photorealistic bronchoscopy scenes and produce multi-modal sensor data—RGB (with realistic noise and specularities), depth maps, surface normals, optical flow, and point clouds—at medically relevant scales, suitable for multi-view and monocular tasks.

Result: Validated on two canonical medical robotics tasks: multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation; demonstrates challenges that current methods must overcome to transfer to bronchoscopy; shows that ROOM data can fine-tune depth estimation models and support navigation and other downstream applications.

Conclusion: ROOM enables large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and procedural scenarios, facilitating training, evaluation, and development of autonomous bronchoscopy. Code and data are available at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Continuum robots are advancing bronchoscopy procedures by accessing complex
lung airways and enabling targeted interventions. However, their development is
limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is
difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns,
and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical
feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a
comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic
bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline
renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and
light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point
clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in
two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and
monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that
state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings.
Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune
existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling
other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will
enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and
procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings. Code

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: StageACT introduces stage-conditioned imitation learning to address long-horizon, partially observable door-opening tasks in humanoid robots, boosting robustness and success while enabling explicit recovery behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Door opening is a common yet challenging long-horizon task with partial observability (e.g., latch state). Standard behavior cloning often suffers from mode collapse and incorrect sequencing, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Augment low-level policies with task-stage inputs (stage conditioning). This stage information guides action selection across the task, and supports stage prompting for recovery behaviors in real time.

Result: In a real-world office setting, StageACT achieved 55% success on previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline, with shorter completion times. It also enables intentional guidance through stage prompts for recovery behaviors.

Conclusion: Stage conditioning is a lightweight, effective mechanism to improve robustness and performance for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation tasks like door opening.

Abstract: Humanoid robots promise to operate in everyday human environments without
requiring modifications to the surroundings. Among the many skills needed,
opening doors is essential, as doors are the most common gateways in built
spaces and often limit where a robot can go. Door opening, however, poses
unique challenges as it is a long-horizon task under partial observability,
such as reasoning about the door's unobservable latch state that dictates
whether the robot should rotate the handle or push the door. This ambiguity
makes standard behavior cloning prone to mode collapse, yielding blended or
out-of-sequence actions. We introduce StageACT, a stage-conditioned imitation
learning framework that augments low-level policies with task-stage inputs.
This effective addition increases robustness to partial observability, leading
to higher success rates and shorter completion times. On a humanoid operating
in a real-world office environment, StageACT achieves a 55% success rate on
previously unseen doors, more than doubling the best baseline. Moreover, our
method supports intentional behavior guidance through stage prompting, enabling
recovery behaviors. These results highlight stage conditioning as a lightweight
yet powerful mechanism for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Motivation: Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks (P&P) are challenging for RL due to sparse rewards and credit assignment. Achieving efficient training and real-time collaboration between legged manipulators remains underexplored, especially with real-world deployment.

Method: A hierarchical RL pipeline with a dynamic reward curriculum that guides a single policy through payload-centered sub-objectives for long-horizon P&P. Extends to dual-robot settings where each robot attends to different parts of its observation at different task stages to enable coordination. Trained in simulation and validated on ANYmal D in both single- and dual-robot scenarios.

Result: In simulation, 55% improvement in training efficiency and 18.6% reduction in execution time. In dual-robot tests, autonomous attention shifts support effective coordination. Real-world validation on ANYmal D confirms feasibility; claims to be the first RL pipeline covering full collaborative P&P with two legged manipulators.

Conclusion: The approach bridges long-horizon RL and real-world legged manipulation, showing that dynamic curricula and observation-space specialization can enable efficient learning and coordination in multi-robot P&P tasks. This paves the way for robust, real-world collaborative legged manipulation and broader adoption of hierarchical RL in complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: We present a hierarchical RL pipeline for training one-armed legged robots to
perform pick-and-place (P&P) tasks end-to-end -- from approaching the payload
to releasing it at a target area -- in both single-robot and cooperative
dual-robot settings. We introduce a novel dynamic reward curriculum that
enables a single policy to efficiently learn long-horizon P&P operations by
progressively guiding the agents through payload-centered sub-objectives.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches for long-horizon RL tasks, our method
improves training efficiency by 55% and reduces execution time by 18.6% in
simulation experiments. In the dual-robot case, we show that our policy enables
each robot to attend to different components of its observation space at
distinct task stages, promoting effective coordination via autonomous attention
shifts. We validate our method through real-world experiments using ANYmal D
platforms in both single- and dual-robot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is
the first RL pipeline that tackles the full scope of collaborative P&P with two
legged manipulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve drone endurance and energy efficiency by enabling rapid, reliable perching to suspend flight and reduce energy expenditure, even in windy or disturbed environments.

Method: Design of a biomimetic, active flexible perching mechanism inspired by Venus flytrap; development of a cascaded extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control to estimate and compensate external disturbances in real time; experimental validation of perching speed, adaptability, and disturbance rejection.

Result: Perching structure demonstrated high-speed adaptability with perching times under 100 ms; cascaded EHGO effectively resisted wind and perching disturbances, validating improved stability and robustness.

Conclusion: The study presents a viable, energy-efficient perching solution for drones, combining a biomimetic fast-perching mechanism with real-time disturbance rejection for robust operation in realistic environments.

Abstract: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in
their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies
explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by
temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that
utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation
mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The
proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching
targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and
validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system
stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is
developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in
real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the
perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind
and perching disturbances.

*Waseem Akram,Katsuhisa Yamanaka*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: New algorithm enumerates all at most k-out polygons for a set of n points with O(n^2 log n) delay, improving from O(n^3 log n) delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve faster, output-sensitive enumeration of geometric polygons with a bounded number of exterior points in a point set.

Method: A new enumeration algorithm is proposed for the at most k-out polygons of a point set in general position; the abstract does not provide specifics of the technique, but it achieves the claimed delay

Result: All at most k-out polygons can be enumerated with O(n^2 log n) delay, improving over the previous O(n^3 log n) delay.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a faster enumeration method for at most k-out polygons, under the general-position assumption, highlighting a significant improvement in delay and suggesting potential for further optimization or extension to related problems.

Abstract: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in the Euclidean plane and general position
i.e., no three points are collinear. An \emph{at most $k$-out polygon of $S$}
is a simple polygon such that each vertex is a point in $S$ and there are at
most $k$ points outside the polygon. In this paper, we consider the problem of
enumerating all the at most $k$-out polygon of $S$. We propose a new
enumeration algorithm for the at most $k$-out polygons of a point set. Our
algorithm enumerates all the at most $k$-out polygons in $\mathcal{O}(n^2
\log{n})$ delay, while the running time of an existing algorithm is
$\mathcal{O}(n^3 \log{n})$ delay.

TL;DR: Proposes DISPLIB, a standardized problem definition and file format for train re-routing and re-scheduling, with open problem instances and a reference solver to enable reproducible comparisons across solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility and comparability in optimization for railway disruption management; public data/code are scarce and heterogeneously defined, hindering empirical evaluation.

Method: Define a common DISPLIB problem definition and file format; collect real-world industrial instances; implement and publish a reference solver; release materials online.

Result: Openly available problem instances and a reference solver; researchers can perform reproducible empirical comparisons of solvers on standardized instances.

Conclusion: Standardizing problem definitions and releasing datasets/solvers accelerates research in train dispatching by enabling fair, reproducible benchmarking and cross-study comparisons.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

### [261] [InPhyRe Discovers: Large Multimodal Models Struggle in Inductive Physical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12263)
*Gautam Sreekumar,Vishnu Naresh Boddeti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InPhyRe is the first visual QA benchmark to assess inductive physical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) by predicting outcomes of synthetic collision events; findings reveal LMMs heavily rely on parametric knowledge, struggle with unseen physics, and are affected by language bias that undermines visual input usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a key gap: current LMM evaluation focuses on learned, parametric physical laws and ignores inductive reasoning needed to adapt to unseen physical environments, which is crucial for safety-critical applications.

Method: Introduce InPhyRe, a visual question answering benchmark built on algorithmically generated collision videos. Evaluate 13 LMMs on predicting outcomes of collision events, including scenarios where demonstration data violate universal physical laws, and analyze the influence of language priors vs. visual inputs.

Result: Findings indicate (1) LMMs cannot effectively apply limited parametric physical knowledge to reasoning; (2) inductive physical reasoning degrades when demonstrations violate universal laws; (3) inductive reasoning is biased by language priors and largely ignores visual inputs, raising questions about trustworthiness in visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Inductive physical reasoning in LMMs remains weak; InPhyRe provides a first step toward evaluating and improving this capability, highlighting the need for models that integrate robust, law-abiding inductive reasoning with reduced reliance on language priors and enhanced visual grounding.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

### [262] [LLMAP: LLM-Assisted Multi-Objective Route Planning with User Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12273)
*Liangqi Yuan,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton,Sabine Brunswicker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) that uses LLM-as-Parser and a Multi-Step Graph construction with iterative Search (MSGS) to optimize multi-objective routing with user constraints; validated on 1000 prompts across 14 countries and 27 cities, showing superior, constraint-guaranteed performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven route planning falls into two camps (LLM-as-Agent, graph-search) but each has limitations: heavy map data handling for LLMs, poor natural-language preference understanding for graphs, and highly variable user distribution requiring robust, adaptable systems.

Method: LLMAP uses an LLM-as-Parser to extract tasks and user preferences and detect dependencies; MSGS algorithm constructs a graph and performs iterative search; a multi-objective optimization with adaptive objective weights aims to maximize POI quality and task completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to time limits, POI hours, and dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments with 1,000 prompts across 14 countries and 27 cities demonstrate superior performance with guarantees under multiple constraints.

Conclusion: The LLMAP framework effectively marries natural-language understanding with structured graph search and adaptive optimization to handle heterogeneous user needs and real-world constraints in route planning.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IoT-enabled greenhouse platform integrates AI-based disease/drought detection; VGG-19 achieves 92% accuracy; preliminary results show effective monitoring and environmental control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continuous monitoring and smart management of greenhouse conditions to improve crop production by linking IoT data with AI-driven disease/drought analysis.

Method: Developed an IoT-based platform for environmental control and data publishing; built an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3; used intentional inoculation and compared AI results with expert evaluation.

Result: IoT system continuously publishes data (temperature, humidity, water flow, tank charge) and adjusts controls; AI results indicate VGG-19 detects drought stress and rust leaves with up to 92% accuracy, outperforming other models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of integrating IoT and AI in a smart aeroponic greenhouse for real-time monitoring, environmental optimization, and early disease/stress detection; further validation and scaling are needed.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open-source, agentic framework AIssistant for end-to-end, human-in-the-loop scientific workflows, integrating literature synthesis, experiments, citation management, and LaTeX generation; early-stage results show drafting efficiency gains and thematic consistency but require human oversight due to factual, methodological, and ethical considerations, with limitations in hallucinations and multimodal content integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmented AI-assisted research tools and the lack of human-centered, end-to-end workflows in scientific publishing, by providing an integrative, open-source platform that keeps humans in the loop.

Method: Development of modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX generation, evaluated in three layers: Independent Human Review (NeurIPS double-blind), Automated LLM Review (GPT-5 proxy), and Program Chair Oversight in ML perspective/review papers.

Result: AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and thematic consistency; human oversight remains essential for factual accuracy, methodological soundness, and ethics; key limitations include hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic structures, and incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for accelerating scientific workflows with human-in-the-loop governance; open-source nature enables collaboration and extension, but substantial work is needed to mitigate hallucinations, ensure up-to-date structural adaptability, and enhance multimodal content handling.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decomposed approach to UI intent understanding: summarize each user action into structured summaries, then extract intents with a fine-tuned model on the summaries, achieving improved on-device performance and even surpassing large MLLMs in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device, privacy-preserving, low-latency intent inference is challenging for small models due to limited capacity, while large multi-modal LLMs offer better performance but are resource-intensive. The work aims to bridge this gap by tailoring a two-stage pipeline that leverages summarization to boost small model effectiveness.

Method: 1) Structured interaction summarization: extract key information from each user action to create compact, informative summaries. 2) Intent extraction: a fine-tuned model operates on the aggregated summaries to infer user intent.

Result: The proposed decomposed method improves intent understanding for resource-constrained models and even surpasses the base performance of large MLLMs on this task.

Conclusion: A two-stage pipeline—summarizing interactions followed by fine-tuned intent extraction on the summaries—effectively enhances on-device intent understanding and narrows the gap with large MLLMs.

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

### [266] [Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434)
*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ententropy-enhanced, multi-turn preference optimization for tool-assisted LLMs; 
sys improves test-time scaling and achieves SOTA on SWE-bench among open-weight models (e.g., a 30B model ranks 1st on Lite, 4th on Verified).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs tackling software engineering must reason over large codebases and coordinate tool usage. Standard alignment (DPO/KTO) can reduce output diversity, limiting performance when coupled with test-time scaling. Multi-turn, tool-assisted coding requires preserving policy entropy and optimizing across sequences of interactions, not single turns.

Method: Introduce the entropy-enhanced framework 
sys that augments preference objectives to preserve policy entropy and generalizes optimization to multi-turn interactions. Adapt existing preference optimization algorithms to multi-turn, tool-assisted settings. Propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection that combines a learned verifier with model-free approaches. Evaluate by fine-tuning diverse models (up to 106B parameters) and testing on SWE-bench. 

Result: On SWE-bench, 
sys establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B-parameter model trained with 
sys ranks 1st on Lite and 4th on Verified on the open-weight leaderboard, outperforming many larger models (e.g., >350B).

Conclusion: Entropy-aware, multi-turn preference optimization enhances diversity and performance for interactive, tool-assisted coding tasks, enabling strong gains from test-time scaling and improving open-weight model competitiveness on SWE-bench.

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM is a compact physics-informed BEV world model that uses Soft Mask training and Warm Start inference to outperform larger baselines and also boost speed at smaller sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a fundamental size–performance trade-off in world models: large models capture physics well but are resource-intensive, while small models are efficient but struggle with accurate dynamics. A compact, physics-informed BEV model aims to deliver strong predictive performance on edge devices.

Method: Develop PIWM, a small-to-mid sized BEV world model that (1) uses Soft Mask during training to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction, and (2) applies a Warm Start technique at inference to enhance zero-shot performance. Evaluate on scales around 130M and 400M parameters, comparing to baselines.

Result: At the same parameter scale (400M), PIWM improves the weighted overall score by 60.6% over the baseline. The smallest PIWM variant (130M with Soft Mask) outperforms the largest baseline (400M) by 7.4% in weighted overall score and achieves 28% faster inference.

Conclusion: A compact, physics-informed BEV model with Soft Mask training and Warm Start inference can outperform larger baselines while offering faster inference, demonstrating that careful architectural and training choices enable high-quality physics predictions with far fewer parameters.

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

TL;DR: Reasoning-aware compression (RAC) mitigates pruning-induced performance losses in reasoning LLMs by jointly reconstructing input activations and on-policy chain-of-thought traces, improving efficiency and/or accuracy compared to standard input-reconstruction pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pruning often focuses on input reconstruction and token-level metrics, but reasoning tasks are decode-dominated and rely on long chain-of-thought traces. Pruning can degrade performance and even slow inference when it increases thinking tokens without improving results.

Method: Introduce RAC as a drop-in fix during pruning: during compression, jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This integrates with existing pruning workflows (e.g., SparseGPT).

Result: RAC significantly boosts pruning performance for reasoning LLMs, reducing accuracy/latency trade-offs and mitigating cases where pruning makes decoding slower due to longer CoT. Code available at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Reasoning-aware compression is an effective, plug-in improvement to existing pruning pipelines for reasoning LLMs, aligning compression objectives with the decoding-centric nature of chain-of-thought tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of statistical power analysis in clinical research, with deployment across institutions.

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The work ties Soma Cube puzzle complexity to cognitive strategies, showing that chunking, sorting, scaffolding, and inference, plus artifacts, can reduce apparent time complexity, proposing intelligence as a library of algorithms leveraging mind and matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge cognitive science and computational complexity by quantifying task difficulty and showing how strategies transform branching in problem-solving, using a physical puzzle as a testbed.

Method: Analyze the puzzle's branching factor via the search tree outdegree; iteratively refine a trial-and-error search by layering preprocessing (chunking), value ordering (free-sorting), variable ordering (scaffolding), and pruning (inference); discuss role of artifacts and model intelligence as a library of algorithms.

Result: Quantitatively assess how different cognitive strategies modify task complexity; demonstrate reductions in effective time complexity through strategic preprocessing, ordering, and pruning; articulate a framework connecting cognitive strategies to algorithmic reductions and material constraints.

Conclusion: Competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity by exploiting physical constraints; intelligence can be viewed as a library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of mind and matter.

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand heterogeneous crash risk in roundabouts and provide auditable, interpretable insights for safer design and countermeasures in public safety analytics.

Method: Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to uncover co-occurring factors and derive four crash patterns, followed by a tree-based severity model interpreted with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Data: Ohio roundabout crashes, 2017–2021.

Result: Four crash patterns identified; higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds co-occur with fixed-object or angle events; lower severity in clear, low-speed settings. Pattern-specific mechanisms include entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation (improper maneuvers), and slow-downs (rear-end). SHAP quantifies drivers of injury within/between patterns.

Conclusion: The workflow links pattern discovery with case-level explanations, enabling site screening, countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. It contributes a practical IS template for usable XAI in public safety analytics.

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to

queries and 100 documents per query, and was trained end-to-end from
unannotated queries and documents in less than 10,000 H100-hours.

Conclusion: First work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, MT, and text reimposition for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows, demonstrating feasibility of rapid, visually consistent multilingual ads.

Abstract: Adapting advertisements for multilingual audiences requires more than simple
text translation; it demands preservation of visual consistency, spatial
alignment, and stylistic integrity across diverse languages and formats. We
introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human
oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text

TL;DR: Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems for real-time agent support in contact centers (Minerva CQ). Proactively identifies customer intent, triggers workflows, maintains evolving context, and adapts to conversation state, outperforming reactive rule-based or RAG approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce cognitive load on agents and improve CX metrics (AHT, first-call resolution, CSAT) by addressing fragmentation and manual tasks; highlight limitations of existing AI agent-assisted tools that are reactive, rule-based, or retrieval-augmented without deep contextual reasoning.

Method: Proposes an Agentic AI architecture and presents a case study of Minerva CQ. The system integrates real-time transcription, intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval, dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries to enable proactive workflows and continuous context-building in live production deployments.

Result: Reported measurable improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple live deployments.

Conclusion: Agentic AI provides proactive, context-aware support that evolves during conversations, surpassing traditional reactive approaches and enabling scalable real-time agent assistance in contact centers.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical design pattern for deploying high-speed, precise, user-centric agentic AI systems in dynamic environments, highlighting scalability, reliability, and usability as core priorities for live sports info assistants.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural

Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A train-once, adapt-broadly framework (DaSAThco) uses an LLM-guided portfolio of problem-archetype ensembles to map SAT instance features to tailored heuristic ensembles, claiming strong out-of-domain generalization and scalable automated algorithm design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT solvers rely on internal heuristics; problem heterogeneity means no single configuration is optimal across all instances. Prior auto-tuning methods lack generalization and require costly re-optimization for new problem types.

Method: Leverages a Large Language Model guided by well-defined Problem Archetypes to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles, then learns an adaptive selector to map instance features to the appropriate ensemble, enabling a train-once, deploy-anywhere workflow.

Result: Empirical results indicate superior performance and robust out-of-domain generalization compared to non-adaptive baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable, practical approach to automated algorithm design for complex configurable systems by combining LLM-driven ensemble generation with adaptive selection.

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

*Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AD-FCoT is a prompting framework that merges analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought in finance, using only prompts, to improve sentiment analysis of financial news and its correlation with market returns. It claims superior accuracy and interpretability without training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sentiment models struggle to capture complex economic context and provide transparent reasoning, reducing reliability for financial decision-making.

Method: AD-FCoT prompts LLMs to draw analogies between new events and historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding these parallels into a structured step-by-step chain-of-thought for sentiment prediction, with no fine-tuning or additional data required.

Result: On thousands of news articles, AD-FCoT outperformed strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieved higher correlation with market returns; generated explanations aligned with domain expertise.

Conclusion: Combining analogical reasoning with CoT in finance is novel and effective; prompts alone can yield interpretable, finance-relevant reasoning without extra training, aiding real-world analysis.

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GBV-SQL introduces a multi-agent framework that uses SQL-to-text back-translation validation to ensure generated SQL aligns with user intent, exposes widespread Gold Errors in benchmarks, and reports large performance gains on cleaned Spider data after removing flawed examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent semantic gap in Text2SQL where syntactically correct queries misinterpret user intent, compounded by unreliable benchmarks with ground-truth flaws that obscure true model performance.

Method: A multi-agent system (GBV-SQL) uses Guided Generation and SQL2Text Back-translation Validation. A specialized agent translates generated SQL back to natural language to check alignment with the original question. The paper also defines a formal typology of Gold Errors to diagnose benchmark flaws.

Result: On BIRD benchmark, GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy (5.8% absolute improvement). After removing flawed examples, performance on Spider improves to 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test).

Conclusion: The work provides a robust semantic-validation framework and critiques benchmark integrity, underscoring the need for rigorous dataset curation to reveal true model capabilities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

TL;DR: RF outperforms SVR/LSTM for one-month-ahead MB CWG forecasting using herd data with weather and age; RF achieves R^2 0.973, RMSE 0.040, MAE 0.033; automated preprocessing tool released on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing feeding strategies, breeding decisions, and risk management in cattle farming under climate variability and market fluctuations; demand for accurate, data-driven weight-gain forecasts.

Method: Comparative study of RF, SVR, and LSTM using four datasets (756 samples from 108 cattle) with features including weather (rainfall, temperature) and age; evaluation via R^2, RMSE, MAE; development of an automated preprocessing tool to generate a benchmark MB CWG dataset; RF reported as best-performing model.

Result: RF consistently outperformed SVR and LSTM across all datasets, achieving R^2 = 0.973, RMSE = 0.040, MAE = 0.033 when weather and age were included; results highlight the importance of incorporating both weather and age factors for accuracy.

Conclusion: RF is a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight gain under variable conditions; age and climatic factors significantly influence herd weight dynamics; public preprocessing tool aids dataset preparation and supports future research in MB CWG forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

*Yong Xia,Jingxuan Li,YeTeng Sun,Jiarui Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe encodes ECG signals into a universal language for LLMs, enabling model-agnostic fine-tuning, interpretable bidirectional ECG-language mappings, and explicit time-scale encoding, with strong BLEU-4 gains and competitive ROUGE-L/METEOR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome transferability issues across ECG encoders and LLMs, address the loss of time-scale information due to Transformer limitations, and improve interpretability for clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes ECG-aBcDe, which converts ECG signals into a universal ECG language; builds a hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language to allow direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural changes; enables bidirectional ECG↔ECG-language conversion to extract attention heatmaps; explicitly encodes time-scale information to mitigate Transformer limitations.

Result: Achieves competitive ROUGE-L and METEOR scores; notable BLEU-4 gains with improvements of 2.8x in-dataset and 3.9x cross-dataset, reaching 42.58 and 30.76, supporting the feasibility of a model-agnostic ECG-LLM paradigm.

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe introduces a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs, offering transferability across models without architectural changes, enhanced interpretability via attention heatmaps, and explicit time-scale encoding along with strong quantitative gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoCO is a new end-to-end framework that uses LLM-guided constraint relaxation for nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems, coupled with a bidirectional global-local search (Monte Carlo Tree Search for global exploration and Evolutionary Algorithms for local refinement). It outperforms baselines on three NCOP benchmarks.


<details>

Motivation: NCOPs are nonconvex with multi-modal solution spaces, making them hard to solve. Traditional constraint relaxation relies on manual, expert-driven, iterative design and lacks automation and scalable adaptability. While LLMs show potential in optimization, they have mostly been passive validators rather than proactive strategists, especially in handling complex constraint interactions.

Method: AutoCO introduces a fully automated constraint-optimization pipeline using structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint-relaxation strategies. It employs a unified triple-representation scheme to integrate relaxation strategies, executable code, and problem constraints. A bidirectional coevolution mechanism combines Evolutionary Algorithms (for intensive local refinement) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (for systematic global strategy-space exploration), balancing intensification and diversification in fragmented search spaces.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three challenging NCOP benchmarks shows that AutoCO consistently outperforms baselines, demonstrating robust effectiveness and superior performance across diverse problems.

Conclusion: AutoCO represents a first-of-its-kind end-to-end approach that learns to relax constraints with LLMs, tightly integrated with global-local search, enabling automated, scalable, and effective resolution of NCOPs. The framework highlights the potential of marrying LLM-driven strategy generation with principled search to tackle complex, interacting constraints.

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

### [282] [Large Language Models Imitate Logical Reasoning, but at what Cost?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12645)
*Lachlan McGinness,Peter Baumgartner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A longitudinal study shows frontier LLMs improve reasoning over 18 months, aided by hidden Chain-of-Thought prompting and new thinking models; a neuro-symbolic pipeline using small LLMs plus a Z3 SMT solver delivers near-perfect accuracy with substantially reduced compute, with FLOP estimates within 10% of actuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track how LLMs' reasoning capabilities evolve over time and to evaluate prompting strategies (e.g., CoT) and neuro-symbolic methods for efficient, reliable reasoning.

Method: The study evaluates three leading models on PrOntoQA true/false questions from Dec 2023, Sept 2024, and Jun 2025, measuring accuracy and faithfulness to specified reasoning strategies via in-context prompts. It introduces a neuro-symbolic architecture where sub-15B LLMs translate problems into a standardized form, which is then executed as a program in the Z3 SMT solver. The work reports prompt/completion tokens and FLOPs for open-source models and analyzes the accuracy of the common FLOP approximation (active parameters × total tokens).

Result: 2023→2024 performance gains are attributed to hidden Chain-of-Thought prompting; 2024→2025 gains stem from the adoption of thinking models. The neuro-symbolic approach achieves substantially lower computational cost while preserving near-perfect performance, with the standard FLOP approximation falling within ~10% across experiments.

Conclusion: Prompting strategies that reveal reasoning steps and neuro-symbolic architectures combining LLMs with SMT solvers can deliver high accuracy at lower compute, and the FLOP heuristic remains a reasonable predictor of cost for these setups.

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

### [283] [Zero-shot Graph Reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Framework with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12743)
*Hanqing Li,Kiran Sheena Jyothi,Henry Liang,Sharika Mahadevan,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GRRAF is a training-free method that uses retrieval-augmented generation with LLMs to generate executable code queries against a graph database, enabling scalable graph reasoning without fine-tuning; it demonstrates strong accuracy across common graph tasks and scales to graphs with up to 10k nodes, with stable token costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph reasoning methods rely on task-specific algorithms or extensive finetuning of models, which hampers generalization and scalability. A retrieval-augmented strategy using LLMs could provide flexible, coding-based reasoning that adapts to various graph tasks without bespoke training.

Method: Store the target graph in a graph database. Use an LLM prompted to generate executable code queries that retrieve necessary information. Include an error-feedback loop with a time-out to ensure correctness and efficiency. The approach is training-free and evaluated on the GraphInstruct dataset.

Result: GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks (e.g., cycle detection, bipartite checks, shortest path, maximum flow). Subgraph matching is imperfect but still high. Token costs remain constant across graph sizes, and the method scales to graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Conclusion: GRRAF demonstrates that combining retrieval-augmented generation with LLMs can enable robust, training-free graph reasoning at scale, bypassing fine-tuning and predefined algorithms. While highly effective on many tasks, subgraph matching remains a challenge and warrants further exploration.

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

### [284] [H$^2$R: Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection for Multi-Task LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12810)
*Shicheng Ye,Chao Yu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chengdong Xu,Yinqi Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H^2R) for LLM agents, introducing a two-level memory (high-level planning and low-level execution) to enable fine-grained knowledge transfer; shows improved generalization over baselines like Expel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic memory transfer is inefficient for multi-task LLM agents; need decoupled, reusable knowledge at different abstraction levels to improve generalization and decision-making.

Method: Introduce hierarchical memory architecture; Hierarchical Hindsight Reflection (H^2R) distills knowledge from past agent–environment interactions; test-time retrievals separate for high-level and low-level memories to guide planning and execution.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two benchmarks shows improved generalization and decision-making, outperforming prior baselines such as Expel.

Conclusion: Hierarchical memories with H^2R enable fine-grained, reusable knowledge transfer for LLM-based agents in multi-task settings, offering better generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

### [285] [LTA-thinker: Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework for Large Language Models on Complex Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12875)
*Jiaqi Wang,Binquan Ji,Haibo Luo,Yiyang Qi,Ruiting Li,Huiyan Wang,Yuantao Han,Cangyi Yang,jiaxu Zhang,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent Thought-Augmented Training (LTA-Thinker) increases latent-thought variance via a learnable prior and uses a multi-objective co-training objective (Semantic Alignment KL loss and Reasoning Focus contrastive loss) to improve reasoning; achieves state-of-the-art performance and better scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overthinking and bottlenecks in generating high-quality latent thoughts for large language models, leveraging test-time scaling and distributional insights to boost reasoning efficiency and performance.

Method: Propose LTA-Thinker with a learnable-prior Latent Thought generation architecture to raise LT variance, and a distributional directional optimization with multi-objective co-training: standard SFT loss plus Semantic Alignment Loss (KL divergence between LT and question semantics) and Reasoning Focus Loss (contrastive objective emphasizing critical reasoning steps).

Result: Empirical results show LTA-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines, with a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects (due to increased LT variance and improved alignment).

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker effectively enhances latent-thought variance and semantic alignment, improving reasoning performance and scalability in large language models.

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

*Tairan Fu,David Campo-Nazareno,Javier Coronado-Blázquez,Javier Conde,Pedro Reviriego,Fabrizio Lombardi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate plausible European street addresses, but validity and privacy concerns limit their reliability for real-world usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LLMs can handle structured, real-world data generation (addresses) and discuss implications for data quality and privacy.

Method: Prompt LLMs to produce random European addresses across multiple countries; evaluate format validity, linguistic localization, and randomness; check for existence of addresses and potential memorization of real addresses; apply post-processing steps to ensure synthetic data.

Result: Generated outputs are plausible and diverse in format but frequently violate country-specific address conventions or include non-existent street names; randomness is controllable via sampling but requires validation; some prompts yielded near-real addresses, indicating potential memorization risk.

Conclusion: LLMs can generate synthetic addresses with structured formats, but accuracy and safety require validation pipelines and safeguards against memorization; treat outputs as synthetic for testing and development rather than ground truth data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of solving complex math problems or
answer difficult questions on almost any topic, but can they generate random
street addresses for European cities?

*Jai Singla,Peal Jotania,Keivalya Pandya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CNN-ANN pipeline uses 0.3m HR imagery, DEM 0.5m, and vector boundaries to classify buildings and estimate population; achieves high F1 and a Gandhinagar population estimate; aims for scalable urban governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys and censuses are expensive, time-consuming, and manpower-intensive. A high-resolution, AI-driven geospatial approach promises faster, scalable population estimation to support urban planning.

Method: CNN classifies buildings as residential vs non-residential; ANN estimates population using features from HR imagery, DEM, and boundaries. About 48k building footprints in Gandhinagar (residential subset used for population estimation). Evaluation reports F1-score of 0.9936. Population for Gandhinagar estimated at 278,954. Notes on real-time data updates and standardized metrics.

Result: F1-score of 0.9936 for building-type classification; population estimate for Gandhinagar: 278,954; demonstrates effectiveness on a large-scale dataset and potential for scalable, real-time urban analytics.

Conclusion: The approach shows that AI-driven geospatial analytics can enhance data-driven urban governance, offering a scalable, replicable tool to replace or augment census-based population estimation in rapidly urbanizing cities.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides
municipalities with a scalable and replicable tool for optimized resource
management in rapidly urbanizing cities, showcasing the efficiency of AI-driven
geospatial analytics in enhancing data-driven urban governance.

*Xingxing Hong,Yungong Wang,Dexin Jin,Ye Yuan,Ximing Huang,Zijian Wu,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel, 12-scenario MARL benchmark for StarCraft II (HLSMAC) inspired by the Thirty-Six Stratagems, with new multi-dimensional metrics and integration of MARL and LLM-based agents to evaluate high-level strategic decision-making beyond micromanagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks (e.g., SMAC) emphasize micromanagement in StarCraft II and under-assess high-level strategic intelligence, coordination, and deception. There is a need for benchmarks that stress strategic reasoning and planning in cooperative MARL.

Method: Design 12 StarCraft II scenarios, each mapped to a stratagem from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Implement these scenarios to challenge tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception. Propose new metrics (ability utilization, advancement efficiency) alongside traditional win-rate. Integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents, and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate high-level strategic decision-making.

Result: HLSMAC provides a robust, discriminative testbed for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making in MARL. The new metrics capture dimensions beyond win rate, and empirical results demonstrate the benchmark’s utility and the feasibility of integrating MARL and LLM-based agents in this setting.

Conclusion: HLSMAC offers a multidimensional, strategically focused benchmark to advance MARL research on high-level decision-making. It enables systematic evaluation of strategic intelligence and coordination, with opportunities for further refinement of metrics, expansion to additional stratagems, and broader cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

*Jeremias Ferrao,Matthijs van der Lende,Ilija Lichkovski,Clement Neo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSRL introduces a transparent alignment framework: a lightweight adapter steers model behavior by modulating sparse autoencoder features, achieving competitive preference optimization with RLHF and enabling mechanistic insights into alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF yields diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it hard to understand what models internalize; a transparent, diagnosable alignment method is needed.

Method: Train a lightweight adapter to modulate interpretable features extracted from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) via reinforcement learning, enabling feature steering to optimize human preferences.

Result: FSRL is effective for preference optimization and comparable to RLHF methods; mechanistic analysis shows the adapter's policy emphasizes style features over explicit alignment concepts, suggesting preference optimization rewards stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality.

Conclusion: FSRL provides a tool for interpretable model control and diagnosing the internal mechanisms of alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Evo-Merging, a derivative-free black-box model merging framework for massive LLMs using only inference-time API queries, combining sparsity-based denoising and sign-aware scaling to optimally merge models without access to weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Merge multiple models when weights are inaccessible (e.g., LLMs as a service), tackling the limitations of weight-reliant merging methods in a black-box setting.

Method: An evolutionary-algorithm-based framework (Evo-Merging) with two core components: (1) sparsity-based denoising to filter out irrelevant/redundant information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling to dynamically compute optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on performance. The approach is derivative-free and relies solely on inference-time API queries, with formal justification and theoretical analysis for asymmetric sparsification.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art results across a range of tasks, significantly outperforming strong baselines; extensive experiments validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of black-box model merging for massive LLMs using Evo-Merging, backed by theoretical insights on sparsification and practical performance gains, suggesting broad applicability in black-box model integration without access to model weights.

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

*Bihao Zhan,Jie Zhou,Junsong Li,Yutao Yang,Shilian Chen,Qianjun Pan,Xin Li,Wen Wu,Xingjiao Wu,Qin Chen,Hang Yan,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes PeCL: token-level dynamic DP and privacy-guided memory sculpting to balance privacy and continual learning accuracy, by allocating DP budget by token sensitivity and forgetting sensitive info from memory while preserving task-invariant knowledge; shows improved privacy-utility trade-offs vs baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning models gather diverse data over time, creating privacy risks. Uniform Differential Privacy budgets can hurt utility and hinder deployment in privacy-sensitive settings. A selective, adaptive privacy mechanism is needed to protect sensitive content while preserving useful knowledge for continual learning.

Method: Two main components: (1) token-level dynamic Differential Privacy that allocates privacy budgets according to the semantic sensitivity of individual tokens, protecting private entities with more noise for sensitive tokens and less for non-sensitive knowledge; (2) a privacy-guided memory sculpting module that uses the sensitivity analysis to forget sensitive information from the model's memory and parameters, while preserving task-invariant historical knowledge to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments show PeCL achieves a better privacy-utility balance, maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy and outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: Dynamic, token-aware privacy budgeting coupled with memory sculpting can enable privacy-preserving continual learning by selectively protecting sensitive information and retaining core historical knowledge, reducing the typical utility loss of DP in CL.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

*Yarin Benyamin,Argaman Mordoch,Shahaf S. Shperberg,Roni Stern*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A planning-oriented assistant (Planning Copilot) enhances LLMs with external planning tools via MCP, enabling reliable long-horizon planning without domain-specific fine-tuning and outperforming several baselines including GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reliable long-horizon planning and controlled execution. Integrating external planning tools through a standard interface (MCP) could leverage the strengths of LLMs while ensuring robust planning workflows.

Method: Introduce Planning Copilot chatbot that connects LLMs to multiple planning tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It supports syntax checking of planning problems, choosing and invoking planners, validating generated plans, and simulating execution. Evaluation uses three open-source LLMs and a qualitative comparison with GPT-5.

Result: Planning Copilot substantially outperforms the same LLMs when used with planning tools versus without tools. It also significantly outperforms GPT-5 in a limited qualitative comparison, despite relying on a smaller LLM.

Conclusion: Dedicated planning tools coupled with an MCP-based integration can empower LLMs to perform planning tasks more effectively. This approach may reduce the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and highlights the value of tool-based planning for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

TL;DR: Across media, the AKP and variants describe how success hinges on essential conditions; here, success depends on medium-specific structure, with novels showing reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia blending AKP with ordered patterns, academic papers showing reverse AKP in order but noisy in position, and films diverging by genre.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) and its variants across diverse media, revealing how success/failure patterns depend on medium-specific structural constraints.

Method: Represent texts as sequences of functional blocks and assess convergence in transition order and position; compare AKP, reverse AKP, ordered, and noisy patterns across novels, Wikipedia, academic papers, and movies.

Result: Structural principles vary by medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order; Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered patterns; academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in position; movies diverge by genre.

Conclusion: Successful outcomes depend on domain-specific structural constraints; failure patterns vary across domains; the AKP framework yields insight into how structure governs success across media.

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Motivation: Addresses the gap where existing agent-society frameworks lack systematic evaluations for event organization and lack integrated, visually grounded environments, hindering realistic navigation and interaction with items.

Method: Developed MiniAgentPro visualization platform (map editor + simulation player). Built a test suite of eight diverse event scenarios with basic and hard variants. Conducted evaluations using GPT-4o.

Result: GPT-4o achieves strong performance in basic settings but shows coordination challenges in hard variants; the platform enables visualization-based assessment of agents in spatial environments.

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro provides a practical tool for visual, spatial evaluation of agent societies; results indicate current LLM-based agents handle simple tasks well but require improved planning and coordination capabilities for complex, physically grounded coordination tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

### [295] [Reasoning with Preference Constraints: A Benchmark for Language Models in Many-to-One Matching Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13131)
*Marylou Fauchard,Florian Carichon,Margarida Carvalho,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a 369-instance College Admissions Problem benchmark to test LLMs on feasibility, stability, and optimality; finds that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models but no prompting strategy universally wins; iterative prompting with feedback is non-monotonic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap of applying LLMs to matching problems with preferential and structural constraints and evaluate how different prompting strategies affect performance across constraints.

Method: Construct a 369-instance benchmark of the College Admission Problem with student and program preferences. Evaluate open-weight LLMs (e.g., QwQ, GPT-oss, Llama, Qwen, Mistral) under prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning, and role-based prompting, plus iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback.

Result: LLMs can satisfy some constraints but fail to meet all criteria consistently. Reasoning LLMs outperform traditional models. Prompt types influence performance variably, with no single prompt yielding best results across the board. Iterative prompting with feedback is not monotonic and can peak early, then decline.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a new perspective on reasoning in combinatorial optimization with preferential constraints. Prompting strategy choices matter, but more work is needed to achieve reliable feasibility, stability, and optimality across instances.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

*Henrik Axelsen,Valdemar Licht,Jan Damsgaard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An ADR-designed agentic AI system for FCC in fintech, with explainability and auditability, delivering a reference architecture and prototype that reconfigures workflows under regulatory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) and opaque AI solutions; regulatory expectations remain unmet. There is a need for transparent, explainable automation to support governance in high-stakes, regulated environments.

Method: Action Design Research (ADR) with a fintech partner and regulatory stakeholders; artifact-centric modeling; bounded autonomous agents with task-specific model routing and audit logging; design, deployment, and evaluation of a real-world prototype.

Result: A reference architecture, a deployed real-world prototype, and insights into how agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory constraints; demonstrates transparency and institutional trust within accountability structures.

Conclusion: Automation embedded in accountable governance can improve transparency and trust in regulated FCC processes; this work extends IS literature on AI-enabled compliance and informs future design of compliant, explainable AI systems.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

### [297] [G-CSEA: A Graph-Based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm for Identifying Infeasibility in Pseudo-Boolean Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13203)
*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: G-CSEA is a graph-based method for extracting a conflict set from pseudo-Boolean scheduling constraints, inspired by CDCL, producing a set of jointly infeasible constraints; can be minimized with QuickXplain to obtain an IIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify the root causes of infeasibility in rule-based workforce scheduling models with pseudo-Boolean constraints, addressing limitations of existing IIS extraction methods (Additive Deletion, QuickXplain) and dual-ray LP-based approaches which may be inefficient or inapplicable.

Method: Build an implication graph during constraint propagation for the pseudo-Boolean model; when a conflict is detected, backtrace through both decision branches to enumerate all constraints contributing to the conflict, yielding a conflict set; optionally minimize this set with QuickXplain to obtain an IIS.

Result: The approach yields a conflict set of constraints that are jointly infeasible; it can optionally be minimized to form an IIS, potentially reducing the number of solver calls compared to repeated feasibility checks.

Conclusion: G-CSEA offers a CDCL-inspired mechanism for conflict detection in pseudo-Boolean scheduling models, providing a practical and potentially more efficient route to IIS computation by producing a comprehensive conflict set that can be minimized when needed.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

### [298] [Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13234)
*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs can aid diabetic retinopathy screening beyond binary outputs; MedGemma (open-source) shows stronger baseline performance and stability than GPT-4o in DR detection; GPT-4o excels with MedGemma-driven descriptive outputs in collaborative AI-assisted screening, achieving high AUROC; outputs and explainability matter for clinician trust; open models beneficial for low-resource settings; MLLMs can simulate clinical AI assistance across output configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective output formats for AI-assisted DR screening and to assess how multimodal LLMs simulate clinical AI assistance across different configurations, using two models on two datasets.

Method: Baseline evaluation of two MLLMs (GPT-4o and MedGemma) on DR detection (IDRiD, Messidor-2); simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions; real AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o used MedGemma outputs; evaluation of detection metrics (sensitivity, AUROC, specificity) under different scenarios.

Result: MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline with higher sensitivity and AUROC; GPT-4o had near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models altered predictions when given simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o degraded with incorrect inputs while MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong performance guided by MedGemma’s descriptive outputs (AUROC up to 0.96) even without direct image access.

Conclusion: MLLMs can enhance DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying AI-assisted clinical workflows across output types. Open, lightweight models like MedGemma are particularly valuable in low-resource settings, and descriptive outputs may improve explainability and clinician trust.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces COLMA, a scenario-driven memory architecture for AI that aims to support lifelong learning and human-like reasoning as a step toward AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI memory systems exhibit limited adaptability, poor multimodal integration, and lack of continuous learning. There is a need for a robust, human-like memory framework to enable lifelong learning and more general intelligent behavior, aligning with progress toward AGI.

Method: Proposes a scenario-driven methodology to extract essential functional requirements from representative cognitive scenarios, derive a unified set of design principles for memory, and instantiate them in the Cognitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA) that integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms.

Result: A cohesive architectural framework and design principles for AI memory that supports lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, providing a structured foundation for developing AI systems closer to pragmatic AGI.

Conclusion: COLMA offers a structured, principled foundation for next-generation AI memory, potentially accelerating practical progress toward AGI by enabling robust, adaptable, and multimodal memory capabilities.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

### [300] [RepIt: Representing Isolated Targets to Steer Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13281)
*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt introduces a simple, data-efficient framework to isolate concept-specific representations in LLMs, enabling targeted interventions (e.g., suppressing refusals for certain concepts) with minimal neurons and data across five frontier models, but it highlights potential misuse and benchmark evasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable granular, concept-level control of LLM behavior by isolating and manipulating pure concept vectors, reducing overgeneralization while preserving overall safety.

Method: A data-efficient framework that isolates concept-specific representations (concept vectors). It enables targeted interventions by suppressing refusals on specific concepts while preserving refusals elsewhere. The corrective signal localizes to 100–200 neurons. Robust target representations can be extracted from as few as ~12 examples on a single A6000. Evaluated across five frontier LLMs.

Result: The framework can selectively suppress refusals for targeted concepts (e.g., enabling WMD-related Qs) while maintaining safety on standard benchmarks. The corrective signal localizes to a small neuron set, and data efficiency allows extraction from few examples.

Conclusion: RepIt demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization and enable granular control of model behavior, but it also raises dual concerns about manipulation of underrepresented topics and evading benchmarks.

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

### [301] [Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13288)
*Marjorie McShane,Sergei Nirenburg,Sanjay Oruganti,Jesse English*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces 'Shapes of cognition' as a concrete paradigm for computational cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are remembered multi-modal knowledge constellations that reduce cognitive load, enabling typical reasoning, pattern recognition, and habit-based action, with recovery methods for atypical outcomes. Emphasizes specificity within cognitive architectures to ensure explainability, extensibility, and trust, and argues for broader applicability beyond LEIAs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle cognitive complexity in language-enabled agents and create explainable, trustworthy, and robust AI systems. Provide mechanisms to handle atypical events via learning-on-the-fly, human-in-the-loop assistance, or actionable situational understanding.

Method: Define 'shapes' as remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge implemented within a concrete cognitive architecture. Establish shapes-based objectives, hypotheses, modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and models. Include recovery strategies for atypical outcomes, such as on-the-fly learning, human guidance, or actionable but imperfect understanding.

Result: Proposes a cohesive framework and methodological blueprint for shapes-based cognitive modeling, with explicit components and objectives. Argues that this approach enhances explainability, extensibility, and trust in LEIAs and has potential applicability to knowledge-based and hybrid AI beyond LEIAs.

Conclusion: Shapes-based modeling provides a codified, architecture-grounded paradigm for cognitive AI. It offers practical pathways to building explainable, adaptable LEIA systems and can invigorate broader knowledge-based and hybrid AI research.

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.
