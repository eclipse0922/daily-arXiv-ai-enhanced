By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D\nvoxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature\nmatching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables\nadaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding\nmore faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and\nenhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks\nincluding RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent\nGaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach\nestablishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with\ndenser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in\nwider communities.

For this, diffusion and\nflow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a\nlearned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that\nignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence\nrequired to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the\ndemand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow\nMatching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,\nthe target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow\nshortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training\nin practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the\neffects of CAR.
