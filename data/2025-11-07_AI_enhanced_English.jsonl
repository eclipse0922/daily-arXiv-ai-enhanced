We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks.

Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases.
