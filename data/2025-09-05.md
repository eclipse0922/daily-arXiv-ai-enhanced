### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFP is a generalized feature prediction framework for masked skeleton modeling that replaces raw coordinate reconstruction with high-level feature prediction, enabling faster training and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAE-style reconstruction on 3D joints yields computational redundancy and limited semantic representation; there is a need for efficient, diverse supervision signals that capture hierarchical spatial-temporal features without relying on precomputed offline features.

Method: Introduce a collaborative learning framework with a lightweight target generation network that dynamically produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies for masked skeleton modeling; use constrained optimization to promote feature diversity and prevent model collapse, avoiding offline feature precomputation.

Result: Achieves 6.2x faster training than standard masked skeleton modeling methods and delivers state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks across NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: GFP provides an efficient, high-level feature prediction paradigm for skeleton-based self-supervised learning, improving both representation quality and training efficiency across large-scale action recognition benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Dimitri Androutsos,Susan Done,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNet-based mitosis detector with domain generalization and teacher-student pseudo-labeling to address domain shift and data imbalance; achieves F1 0.7660 (Track 1) and balanced accuracy 0.8414 (Track 2) on preliminary testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counting mitotic figures is time-consuming and variable; AI can improve consistency but must be robust to domain shift (morphology across organs/species, staining) and class imbalance (mitoses vs normal nuclei).

Method: Pixel-level segmentation with a UNet backbone incorporating contrastive representation learning and domain-adversarial training for domain generalization; a teacher-student strategy generates pixel-level pseudo-masks for annotated mitoses, hard negatives, and normal nuclei; multi-scale CNN classifier for Track 2 using segmentation features in a multi-task framework.

Result: On a preliminary test set, achieved F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 in Track 2.

Conclusion: A unified segmentation-and-classification framework that leverages domain-generalization and pseudo-labeling improves robustness to domain shift and data imbalance, showing promise for robust mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework called GMBM mitigates multiple biases in vision models by (1) identifying known shortcuts during training (ABIL) and (2) suppressing their gradient directions at test time (Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning), plus a test-time bias metric SBA. It achieves stronger worst-group accuracy, reduces multi-attribute bias amplification by about half, and lowers SBA under distribution shifts on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO, offering an end-to-end multibias solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images exhibit multiple overlapping biases (textures, watermarks, makeup, scene-object pairings) that jointly degrade robustness and fairness; mitigating biases individually is insufficient as reducing one can amplify others. A unified, training-plus-test time approach is needed to handle multiple biases.

Method: A lean two-stage framework: (1) ABIL trains encoders for each attribute to reveal known shortcuts and integrates them with the main backbone so the classifier explicitly recognizes these biases; (2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning removes those bias directions from the backbone's gradients, yielding a compact network that ignores the learned shortcuts. A new test-time metric, Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA), separates model-induced bias amplification from distributional shifts.

Result: Empirically validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO, GMBM increases worst-group accuracy, halves multi-attribute bias amplification, and achieves a new low in SBA under increasing bias complexity and distribution shifts.

Conclusion: GMBM provides the first practical, end-to-end solution for multi-bias mitigation in visual recognition by combining training-time bias identification with test-time gradient suppression, complemented by SBA for robust evaluation under distributional changes.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 2M-parameter U-Net matches nnU-Net for left-ventricle segmentation in echocardiography with real-time speed, using simple affine augmentations and deep supervision; large models and complex augmentations offer diminishing returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time LV segmentation in echocardiography is valuable but nnU-Net-based models are bulky and slow; there is a need for a compact, fast model without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: An ablation study over data augmentation schemes, architectural changes (including deep supervision), loss functions, and post-processing to identify effective components; development of a lightweight U-Net (~2M parameters vs ~33M); evaluation on CAMUS (N=500) and an internal dataset (N=311) with Dice metrics.

Result: The lightweight 2M-parameter U-Net achieved Dice scores on CAMUS of LV 0.93, MYO 0.85, LA 0.89, statistically equivalent to nnU-Net (0.93, 0.86, 0.89; p>0.05); it is 16x smaller and 4x faster per frame (1.35 ms vs 5.40 ms). Cross-dataset evaluation on the internal dataset shows comparable generalization.

Conclusion: Affine augmentations and deep supervision are key performance drivers; more complex augmentations and larger model capacities yield diminishing returns; a compact model can deliver real-time performance with equivalent accuracy and robust generalization.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A revised, unsupervised treeX algorithm provides a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning for forest stand segmentation from close-range LiDAR, with presets for ground-based and UAV data. It improves runtime and accuracy over the original treeX, achieves meaningful F1 gains on ground-based data, and enables semi-automatic labeling; it's released as open-source in the pointtree package.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources, limiting practical deployment. There is a need for a lightweight, unsupervised approach that can deliver competitive accuracy and facilitate label generation.

Method: An updated version of the unsupervised treeX algorithm that fuses clustering-based stem detection with region-growing crown delineation. The authors provide two parameter presets for data types: ground-based TLS/PLS and UAV-based ULS. Evaluation spans six public datasets and compares against six open-source methods, highlighting runtime and accuracy improvements.

Result: Compared to the original treeX, the revised method shows F1-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. For ULS data, the preset achieves an F1 of 0.58 while the original fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS, accuracy is on par with recent open-source methods, including deep learning approaches. The approach reduces runtime and is validated on multiple datasets; an open-source Python implementation is provided in the pointtree package.

Conclusion: The method offers a viable resource-efficient alternative to deep learning in suitable data conditions and can be used for semi-automatic labeling to train DL models. It broadens applicability through presets for different data types and an accessible open-source implementation.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D leverages reconstructive geometry supervision in a dual-encoder setup to impart spatial reasoning for 3D multimodal models, achieving notable gains on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D scene understanding with large multimodal models is hindered by text-only supervision lacking geometric constraints; there is a need for geometry-aware learning that enforces spatial structure understanding.

Method: A dual-supervision Reg3D framework with object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks, using a dual-encoder architecture to enforce geometric consistency by making geometry both input and learning targets.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D show substantial performance improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models.

Conclusion: Dual reconstruction-based geometry supervision effectively enhances 3D spatial reasoning, suggesting Reg3D as a promising direction for geometry-informed 3D LMMs and a shift from input-only 3D information.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

### [7] [QuantV2X: A Fully Quantized Multi-Agent System for Cooperative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03704)
*Seth Z. Zhao,Huizhi Zhang,Zhaowei Li,Juntong Peng,Anthony Chui,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Hao Xiang,Zhiyu Huang,Fujia Wang,Ran Tian,Chenfeng Xu,Bolei Zhou,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X proposes a fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception, achieving near full-precision accuracy with significantly lower latency and bandwidth, enabling deployable, scalable operation in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2X cooperative perception relies on full-precision models that incur high computation and transmission costs, creating bottlenecks for real-time deployment. There is a need for efficient, deployable, scalable multi-agent perception with reduced compute and comms.

Method: An end-to-end quantization framework that jointly quantizes neural networks and transmitted message representations for multi-modal, multi-agent fusion, enabling low-bit computation and communication while preserving accuracy.

Result: QuantV2X achieves deployment-oriented gains: 3.2x reduction in system-level latency and +9.5 mAP30 over full-precision baselines, with accuracy comparable to full-precision, and better memory scalability for larger models; code will be released.

Conclusion: A fully quantized, efficient multi-agent V2X perception system is viable for real-world deployment, addressing efficiency and deployability gaps in prior work.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

### [8] [Transfer Learning-Based CNN Models for Plant Species Identification Using Leaf Venation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03729)
*Bandita Bharadwaj,Ankur Mishra,Saurav Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientNetB0 provides the best generalization for leaf venation-based plant species classification among three tested CNNs, with MobileNetV2 offering good lightweight performance and ResNet50 showing overfitting; on a 1,125-image Swedish Leaf Dataset across 15 species, EfficientNetB0 achieved the highest test accuracy and robust metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated plant taxonomy based on leaf venation is important for scalable biodiversity assessment; evaluating standard CNN architectures assesses suitability for real-world deployment and real-time apps.

Method: Compared ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 on Swedish Leaf Dataset (15 species, 75 images per species, 1,125 total). Assessed training/testing accuracy and F1, precision, recall; reported overfitting in ResNet50; measured generalization. No mention of data split or augmentation in abstract; we infer standard DL training/validation testing metrics.

Result: ResNet50: train 94.11%, test 88.45%, F1 87.82% (overfitting). MobileNetV2: test 93.34%, F1 93.23% (good generalization). EfficientNetB0: test 94.67%, precision, recall, F1 > 94.6% (best overall).

Conclusion: EfficientNetB0 is robust and scalable for venation-based plant taxonomy; the study highlights potential for accurate automated taxonomy tools, with MobileNetV2 providing a lightweight alternative for real-time applications, while ResNet50 may underperform due to overfitting.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient graph comparison for floor-plan layouts by LayoutGKN using a final-stage differentiable graph kernel on learned node embeddings, achieving accuracy comparable to graph matching networks with faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph matching networks rely on costly cross-graph node interactions, hindering speed for graph-structured floor plans in search/visualization tasks.

Method: LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph interactions to the end of a joint embedding pipeline; uses a differentiable graph kernel as the distance function on final node embeddings to compute similarity.

Result: Empirically achieves similarity scores comparable to or better than graph matching networks while significantly speeding up inference; open-source code/data available.

Conclusion: LayoutGKN is a viable, more efficient alternative for graph comparison of floor plans, balancing accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD: a parameter-efficient, SVD-based fine-tuning of CLIP that tunes only singular values, enabling 0.04% parameter updates to achieve state-of-the-art few-shot performance across 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, with interpretability via NL analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language models to fine-grained domains is challenging due to dependence on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation methods add prompts or adapters, which can reduce performance, destabilize models, and erode pretrained knowledge. A lightweight, parameter-efficient approach is needed to preserve generalization while enabling domain adaptation.

Method: Apply singular value decomposition to the CLIP parameter matrices and fine-tune only the singular values. This modulates the basis vectors for domain adaptation without introducing extra modules, enabling multi-modal adaptation with minimal parameter updates (0.04% of total parameters).

Result: CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. A natural-language-based analysis framework is also used to interpret the adaptation dynamics.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD offers a lightweight yet effective solution for multi-modal domain adaptation in CLIP, preserving pretrained knowledge while delivering strong few-shot performance and interpretability; it demonstrates the practicality of SVD-based parameter-space modulation for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight edge-efficient plant-disease classifier STA-Net uses DeepMAD NAS backbone and a Shape-Texture Attention Module to improve accuracy on subtle plant lesions, achieving 89.0% accuracy with few params and FLOPs on CCMT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment for precision agriculture with high accuracy; traditional lightweight attention struggles with irregular lesion shapes and textures; need for domain-specific, training-free NAS and attention that captures shape/texture.

Method: Twofold: (1) training-free neural architecture search DeepMAD to design an efficient backbone for edge devices. (2) Shape-Texture Attention Module STAM with two branches: deformable convs for shape, Gabor filter bank for texture.

Result: On CCMT plant disease dataset, STA-Net achieves 89.00% accuracy and F1 88.96%; model has 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs; ablations show STAM improves over baseline and standard attention; code released.

Conclusion: Decoupled, domain-informed attention and NAS-optimized backbones offer promising path for edge-deployed plant-disease AI, enabling efficient high-precision inference.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

### [12] [SLENet: A Guidance-Enhanced Network for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03786)
*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UCOD task, a DeepCamo dataset, and SLENet, a network with GAE and LGB that improves localization-guided, multi-scale detection for underwater camouflaged objects; shows superior performance and generality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection is critical for marine ecology but is underexplored due to optical distortions, turbidity, and subtle camouflage; existing COD methods perform poorly in underwater conditions.

Method: Define UCOD task; present DeepCamo dataset; propose SLENet with Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and Localization Guidance Branch (LGB); uses Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) guided by a location map with global semantic info to produce predictions.

Result: SLENet achieves superior performance over SOTA COD methods on DeepCamo and three COD datasets; demonstrates high generality for broader COD tasks.

Conclusion: SLENet addresses underwater camouflage challenges via semantic localization and enhancement; the DeepCamo dataset provides a benchmark; the approach improves multi-scale feature representation and localization-driven decoding for UCOD and COD more generally.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

*Serhii Svystun,Pavlo Radiuk,Oleksandr Melnychenko,Oleg Savenko,Anatoliy Sachenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ensemble of YOLO-based models leveraging visible and thermal imagery improves wind turbine defect detection, surpassing a single YOLOv8 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliable monitoring of wind power plants requires high-resolution, multimodal data processing to detect both visual and thermal defects; current single-model approaches may underperform on multispectral data.

Method: An ensemble that combines a general YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, integrated via a bounding box fusion algorithm to fuse predictions from multispectral channels.

Result: mAP@.5 = 0.93 and F1 = 0.90, outperforming standalone YOLOv8 which achieved mAP@.5 = 0.91.

Conclusion: Multispectral fusion and model ensembling provide a more robust solution for defect detection in wind turbines, enhancing reliability for blades, towers, and components.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

### [14] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple, architecture-agnostic temporal regularization strategy leverages video frame continuity to improve diffusion training, yielding faster convergence, better distributional coverage, and higher generative diversity, with lower gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models trained on static images miss temporal information, leading to slower convergence and limited temporal generalization. Exploiting temporal coherence from videos can provide stronger inductive bias without changing model architecture.

Method: Introduce a lightweight training strategy that incorporates temporal cues from continuous video frames into standard diffusion training. The approach requires no architectural changes and integrates into existing pipelines, leveraging temporal coherence as a regularizer. An optimization analysis links the method to reduced gradient variance.

Result: Empirically on HandCo hand-object interaction data, the method achieves more than 2x faster convergence and lower FID on both training and validation distributions. It also enhances generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations.

Conclusion: Temporal inductive bias from continuous video frames is effective for diffusion training, enabling faster convergence and improved generalization without changing model architecture. The regularization reduces gradient variance, contributing to the observed gains, and suggests broader applicability to temporally coherent data.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D is a 3D vision-language pretraining framework that enables joint local and global reasoning with semantics-aware report matching, achieving SOTA in 3D radiology tasks and transferable to segmentation and prognosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic errors persist due to missed local findings, lack of global context, and inconsistent radiology reports; 3D CTs amplify these issues; a model that aligns local regions with detailed reports and full-volume context is needed.

Method: Multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining for 3D CTs; local and global image-text alignment; full-volume context; language model rewrites; Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical VQA; strong transfer to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction; code and datasets to be released.

Conclusion: MedVista3D advances joint disease detection and holistic interpretation in 3D radiology by integrating local-global reasoning and semantically consistent reporting; addresses under-reading, inattentional blindness, and communication variability; paves the way for robust, scalable 3D vision-language radiology systems.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [16] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL is a causality-guided text prompt learning framework for CLIP that uses visual granulation to create discriminative prompts for fine-grained recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP prompt-learning methods struggle with fine-grained datasets; there is a need for causal-aware, granular prompt design that can distinguish subtle class differences.

Method: Two modules: (1) attribute disentanglement via Brownian Bridge Diffusion to separate shared (non-individualized) vs. class-specific ( individualized) attributes; (2) granule learning to construct visual granules by integrating the attributes under two causal inference strategies to produce more discriminative prompts.

Result: Achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt learning methods on 15 datasets, with especially strong gains on fine-grained tasks.

Conclusion: The combination of visual granulation and causal inference yields more discriminative prompts for CLIP, enhancing performance on fine-grained recognition.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [17] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel event-based turbulence mitigation (EGTM) framework leveraging event cameras to perform temporal lucky fusion, introducing an "event-lucky insight" and a real-world turbulence dataset; claims substantial efficiency gains and state-of-the-art restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limitations of frame-based turbulence mitigation (TM) methods: require high-capacity networks to learn coarse turbulence dynamics from degraded frames at limited frame rates, leading to inefficiency in computation and storage. Event cameras offer microsecond-level temporal resolution and sparse, asynchronous data that could address these bottlenecks.

Method: 1) Propose the "event-lucky insight" linking turbulence distortions to the inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. 2) Develop an EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable, turbulence-free guidance from noisy turbulent events to enable temporal lucky fusion. 3) Build the first turbulence data acquisition system and a real-world event-driven TM dataset.

Result: On their dataset, the method surpasses the existing SOTA TM method by 710x in model size, 214x in inference latency, and 224x in model complexity; achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality with +0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM.

Conclusion: Introducing the event modality yields strong efficiency advantages for TM, evidencing practical benefits of event-driven TM; a real-world event-driven TM dataset is introduced and will be released, along with demo code/data.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

### [18] [Focus Through Motion: RGB-Event Collaborative Token Sparsification for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03872)
*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba introduces adaptive sparseification for RGB-Event multimodal data to improve efficiency and accuracy. It uses Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to selectively discard low-information regions based on scene changes from the event camera, and a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to fuse complementary features. It shows state-of-the-art performance on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD with better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event methods spend equal effort on low-information regions in both image and event modalities, causing high computation and suboptimal performance. Fixed token sparsification fails to adapt to varying sample complexity, harming tokens selection for different scenes.

Method: Proposes FocusMamba with adaptive collaborative sparsification and fusion. An Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) identifies and discards low-information regions in each modality by leveraging scene changes detected by the event camera. A Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) then fuses the remaining informative features from both modalities to capture complementary information.

Result: On DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets, FocusMamba achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, demonstrating a better accuracy–efficiency balance. Code will be released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Adaptive, collaboratively sparse multimodal feature processing with effective cross-modal fusion yields improved detection performance while reducing computations, validating FocusMamba as a practical and scalable solution for RGB-Event detection.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

### [19] [SalientFusion: Context-Aware Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03873)
*Jiajun Song,Xiaoou Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SalientFusion is a context-aware learning framework for Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR) that tackles background distractions, role confusion between staple and side dishes, and semantic bias. It introduces two components—SalientFormer to suppress background and use depth features for role resolution, and DebiasAT to align prompts with visual features—along with two benchmarks (CZSFood-90/164). It achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks and general CZSL datasets, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of new dishes makes it necessary to recognize unseen food categories. CZSFR aligns with Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by treating cuisines and ingredients as attributes and objects. However, practical challenges impede performance: (1) background redundancy distracts feature learning, (2) misclassification due to role confusion between staples and sides, and (3) semantic bias in a single attribute causing understanding confusion.

Method: Propose SalientFusion with two components. SalientFormer removes background redundancy and leverages depth features to resolve role confusion between staple and side dishes. DebiasAT reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features, mitigating bias-driven misclassifications. The approach is evaluated on new benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, and on general CZSL datasets.

Result: SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed CZSFood-90/164 benchmarks and on popular general CZSL datasets, outperforming existing methods. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of background suppression, depth-enabled role resolution, and prompt-visual alignment in reducing biases and improving recognition of unseen food categories.

Conclusion: SalientFusion advances Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition by addressing core challenges and providing dedicated benchmarks for evaluation. The approach and code contribute to more robust unseen-food recognition and facilitate progress in CZSL research.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of human motion video generation that frames the process into five phases (input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, output) and across three modalities (vision, text, audio), reviewing 200+ papers and highlighting the emerging role of large language models, with a public model repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fills the gap left by surveys that focus on isolated methods by offering an end-to-end overview of the generative process and by exploring how large language models can enhance the field.

Method: Literature survey covering more than 200 papers, structured around five generation phases and about ten sub-tasks; cross-modal analysis (vision/text/audio); synthesis of milestones and trends; resource compilation via a public repository of examined models.

Result: Delivers a holistic framework for human motion video generation, summarizes the state-of-the-art across modalities and stages, identifies key milestones and trends, and provides a centralized repository for reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: Introduces a unified, end-to-end perspective for the field and outlines future directions, notably the integration of large language models to boost capabilities of digital humans and the need for consolidated resources and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has garnered significant research interest due
to its broad applications, enabling innovations such as photorealistic singing
heads or dynamic avatars that seamlessly dance to music. However, existing
surveys in this field focus on individual methods, lacking a comprehensive
overview of the entire generative process. This paper addresses this gap by
providing an in-depth survey of human motion video generation, encompassing
over ten sub-tasks, and detailing the five key phases of the generation
process: input, motion planning, motion video generation, refinement, and
output. Notably, this is the first survey that discusses the potential of large
language models in enhancing human motion video generation. Our survey reviews
the latest developments and technological trends in human motion video
generation across three primary modalities: vision, text, and audio. By
covering over two hundred papers, we offer a thorough overview of the field and
highlight milestone works that have driven significant technological
breakthroughs. Our goal for this survey is to unveil the prospects of human
motion video generation and serve as a valuable resource for advancing the

*Bu Jin,Songen Gu,Xiaotao Hu,Yupeng Zheng,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiaoxiao Long,Wei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS: a scalable, controllable occupancy world model that uses temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) with a TensFormer to generate high-fidelity long-term 3D occupancy efficiently, addressing inefficiency, long-term degradation, and lack of controllability in autoregressive approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The occupancy world model must capture fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic evolution, which is challenging for generative models. Existing autoregressive methods are inefficient, suffer from temporal degradation in long-term generation, and lack controllability.

Method: Reformulate occupancy modeling as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task that decomposes modeling into scale-by-scale spatial generation and scene-by-scene temporal prediction. Introduce TensFormer to handle temporal causality and spatial relationships, and propose a holistic pose aggregation strategy for unified occupancy and ego-motion sequence modeling.

Result: OccTENS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on occupancy quality and inference speed, demonstrating higher quality occupancy generation with faster inference time.

Conclusion: The TENS-based approach with TensFormer and pose aggregation offers an efficient, controllable framework for long-term occupancy generation, addressing inefficiency, temporal degradation, and lack of controllability found in autoregressive methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly-supervised dense functional correspondence across categories using vision-language pseudo-labels of functional parts and dense pixel-level contrastive learning; outperforms baselines on synthetic and real benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Across-category dense correspondence is hard; functional parts tied to an object's function often share shape/appearance, suggesting functional cues can guide correspondences for tasks like shape reconstruction and manipulation.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label functional parts from multi-view images and combine this with dense contrastive learning on pixel correspondences to distill functional and spatial knowledge into a model capable of dense functional correspondence; curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets.

Result: Approach demonstrates advantages over baseline solutions using off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision-language models on curated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Weakly-supervised, cross-modal learning of dense functional correspondences is feasible and beneficial, enabling better cross-category matching and enhancing downstream tasks such as reconstruction and manipulation.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attn-Adapter is an online few-shot learning framework for CLIP that uses dual attention (Memory Attn-Adapter and Local-Global Attn-Adapter) to adapt with few labeled examples without retraining, improving cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while keeping inference efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of offline fine-tuning in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP for few-shot tasks, which are computationally heavy and prone to overfitting, by enabling data-efficient, online adaptation.

Method: Introduce a dual-attention architecture added on top of CLIP. Memory Attn-Adapter refines category embeddings using support examples; Local-Global Attn-Adapter enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features. The adapters enable dynamic adaptation from a few labels without retraining the base model and are designed to leverage dataset-specific information. The approach is scalable across CLIP backbones.

Result: Claims that Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization, while maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter provides a practical solution for online few-shot adaptation for CLIP, enabling dynamic, data-efficient improvement without re-training the base model and enhancing generalization across categories and datasets.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but
face challenges in few-shot scenarios due to computationally intensive offline
fine-tuning using prompt learning, which risks overfitting. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning
framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our
design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the
Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,
and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by
integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic
adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model.
Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and
cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling
across CLIP backbones.

*Xiaofu Chen,Israfel Salazar,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPECS is a specificity-enhanced, reference-free RS metric for long image captioning based on CLIP, achieving competitive correlation with human judgments as LLM-based metrics but with far lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional n-gram metrics struggle with semantic correctness for long captions; Representational Similarity (RS) metrics are costly and poorly correlated with human judgments; LLM-based metrics correlate well but are expensive for iterative development.

Method: SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity, rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones, tailored for long image captions and reference-free evaluation.

Result: SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments while being far more efficient, enabling practical iterative checkpoint evaluation during model development.

Conclusion: SPECS offers a practical, efficient RS metric for long image captioning that correlates with human judgments comparable to LLM-based approaches, facilitating faster development cycles.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

TL;DR: ChexGen is a vision-language generative model for chest radiographs that supports text-, mask-, and bounding-box-guided synthesis. It is pretrained on 960k radiograph–report pairs and enables data augmentation, supervised pretraining, and fairness improvements across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images limits reliable AI in healthcare. A unified generative framework can improve data efficiency and equity by producing high-quality, controllable radiographs for training and bias mitigation.

Method: A latent diffusion transformer architecture enabling unified text, mask, and bounding-box guided synthesis. Pretrained on a large chest X-ray dataset (960k radiograph–report pairs). Evaluation relies on expert judgments and quantitative metrics.

Result: ChexGen achieves accurate radiograph synthesis and demonstrates utility in training data augmentation and supervised pretraining, improving disease classification, detection, and segmentation with limited data. It also supports creating diverse cohorts to detect and mitigate demographic biases, enhancing fairness.

Conclusion: Generative foundation models can transform medical AI by delivering accurate, data-efficient, and equitable systems; ChexGen showcases a scalable approach for synthesis, pretraining, and bias mitigation in chest radiography.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable
medical AI systems.

### [26] [LMVC: An End-to-End Learned Multiview Video Coding Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03922)
*Xihua Sheng,Yingwen Zhang,Long Xu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework leveraging independent-view motion and content to improve dependent-view compression, with feature-based MV prediction, inter-view entropy models, and disparity-free inter-view context prediction. Outperforms MV-HEVC reference software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview videos enable volumetric scene reconstruction but entail massive data; existing DL coding largely targets single-view or stereo, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. Aims to achieve efficient, random-access, backward-compatible multiview coding.

Method: LMVC framework with two core components: (1) inter-view motion handling via feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction conditioned on decoded independent-view motion features, plus an inter-view motion entropy model learning priors; (2) inter-view content handling via a disparity-free inter-view context predictor that derives contexts from decoded independent-view content features, plus an inter-view contextual entropy model capturing priors. Designed to maintain random access and backward compatibility in an end-to-end learned setting.

Result: Experimental results show substantial compression efficiency gains over the reference MV-HEVC software, establishing a strong baseline for multiview learning-based video coding.

Conclusion: LMVC demonstrates the efficacy of jointly modeling inter-view motion and content correlations in an end-to-end learned framework, and is a promising foundation for future multiview video coding research.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

### [27] [TopoSculpt: Betti-Steered Topological Sculpting of 3D Fine-grained Tubular Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03938)
*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt refines 3D tubular structures via holistic region modeling, introducing a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint and curriculum persistent homology to achieve global topology preservation and geometry refinement, greatly reducing beta0 errors on airway and Circle of Willis datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction of tubular anatomies (airways, cerebral arteries) requires both geometric fidelity and topological correctness. Existing voxel-wise overlaps and patch-wise topology losses fail to guarantee global integrity, leading to persistent topological errors at inference.

Method: TopoSculpt adopts a holistic whole-region modeling strategy, introduces the Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and uses a curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Significant improvements in geometry and topology: beta0 errors reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on the Circle of Willis (CoW) dataset; tree length and branch detection rates improved by ~10%; validated on challenging pulmonary airway and CoW datasets.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy, outperforming patch-based and localized topology approaches by leveraging global context and a progressive, topology-aware refinement.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

### [28] [Chest X-ray Pneumothorax Segmentation Using EfficientNet-B4 Transfer Learning in a U-Net Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03950)
*Alvaro Aranibar Roque,Helga Sebastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep-learning segmentation of pneumothorax in chest X-rays using a U-Net with EfficientNet-B4 encoder; IoU 0.7008 and Dice 0.8241 on an independent test, indicating effective localization to aid radiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumothorax can be life-threatening and subtle on chest X-rays; automated segmentation could improve detection and localization for radiologists.

Method: A U-Net architecture with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder was trained on the SIIM-ACR pneumothorax dataset with data augmentation; loss combined binary cross-entropy and Dice; evaluated on the independent PTX-498 dataset.

Result: IoU = 0.7008 and Dice score = 0.8241 on PTX-498, demonstrating accurate localization of pneumothorax regions.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support radiologists in detecting subtle cases, potentially improving diagnostic workflow.

Abstract: Pneumothorax, the abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space, can be
life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning
pipeline using a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B4 encoder to segment pneumothorax
regions. Trained on the SIIM-ACR dataset with data augmentation and a combined
binary cross-entropy plus Dice loss, the model achieved an IoU of 0.7008 and
Dice score of 0.8241 on the independent PTX-498 dataset. These results
demonstrate that the model can accurately localize pneumothoraces and support
radiologists.

### [29] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) that uses multimodal LLMs to generate expressive negative descriptions for OOD detection, improving near- and far-OOD performance without training. Achieves state-of-the-art FPR95 on ImageNet (−4.2%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detectors suffer from weak negative space and false negatives. The authors aim to leverage MLLMs to create targeted, expressive negative descriptions that better capture the OOD distribution, addressing both far-OOD and near-OOD scenarios and removing the need for task-specific priors.

Method: 1) Identify images likely to be OOD and prompt an MLLM to describe them, producing negative sentences that characterize OOD. 2) For near-OOD, find ID classes visually similar to negatives and have the MLLM generate visually similar negative labels tailored to that subset, reducing false negatives. 3) Use an adaptive weighted score to balance near- and far-OOD negative spaces, enabling open-environment applicability. 4) The approach is training-free and zero-shot.

Result: On ImageNet, ANTS reduces FPR95 by 4.2 percentage points and establishes a new state-of-the-art. The method is training-free and zero-shot, suggesting strong scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: ANTS offers a flexible, adaptive negative textual space that improves both far- and near-OOD detection without task-specific priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet and high scalability.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

*Yijun Zhou,Yikui Zhai,Zilu Ying,Tingfeng Xian,Wenlve Zhou,Zhiheng Zhou,Xiaolin Tian,Xudong Jia,Hongsheng Zhang,C. L. Philip Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange is a multimodal RSCD framework combining image and text to improve change detection via IFR, TDE, ITFF, outperforming current methods on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, SYSUCD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-only RSCD struggles with illumination, noise, and limited feature representation; integrating textual semantic cues from a vision–language model can provide complementary information and improve robustness.

Method: Introduce Image Feature Refinement (IFR) to highlight key regions; use a vision-language model to generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images; Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) to capture fine-grained semantic shifts; Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) for deep cross-modal fusion; evaluate on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, SYSUCD; code available.

Result: MMChange consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, SYSUCD, demonstrating strong effectiveness and robustness for multimodal RSCD.

Conclusion: Multimodal RSCD with refined image features and semantic textual cues improves accuracy and robustness over image-only approaches; the proposed IFR, TDE, and ITFF modules effectively address modality heterogeneity and environmental disturbances; code released.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

*Yu Bai,Zitong Yu,Haowen Tian,Xijing Wang,Shuo Yan,Lin Wang,Honglin Li,Xitong Ling,Bo Zhang,Zheng Zhang,Wufan Wang,Hui Gao,Xiangyang Gong,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAC-MIL: Spatial-Aware Correlated MIL for WSI classification using a positional encoding module and an MLP-based SAC block to model full instance correlations in linear time, achieving state-of-the-art on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC; handles length extrapolation and avoids heavy CUDA-optimized Transformers; code to be released after acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI classification requires capturing rich spatial relationships and correlations among a very large number of tissue instances. Traditional MIL methods often ignore spatial context or struggle with variable-length, long sequences; a scalable, deployment-friendly approach is needed.

Method: A positional encoding module encodes spatial relationships using instance coordinates (not input order) and supports length extrapolation. The SAC block is an MLP-based full-correlation mechanism with linear time complexity in sequence length, offering full instance interactions without Transformer CUDA complexity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL provides an effective, scalable, and deployment-friendly approach for spatial-aware MIL in WSI classification, combining spatial encoding with an efficient all-pairs correlation mechanism; code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [32] [Improving Vessel Segmentation with Multi-Task Learning and Auxiliary Data Available Only During Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03975)
*Daniel Sobotka,Alexander Herold,Matthias Perkonigg,Lucian Beer,Nina Bastati,Alina Sablatnig,Ahmed Ba-Ssalamah,Georg Langs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task learning framework trains on paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI (with/without vessel annotations) to segment liver vessels in non-contrast MRI, reducing annotated data needs; auxiliary data improves accuracy, especially with scarce labels, and transfers to other domains such as brain tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vessel segmentation in non-contrast liver MRI is challenging and data-hungry; contrast-enhanced scans offer better vessel delineation but are not universally available. The paper aims to leverage auxiliary contrast data during training to improve segmentation without requiring it at inference time.

Method: A multi-task learning setup that uses paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data, with and without vessel annotations, to learn shared representations. Auxiliary contrast data act as a training-time auxiliary task to guide feature learning, improving vessel segmentation on non-contrast images.

Result: Auxiliary, training-only contrast data improved segmentation accuracy on non-contrast liver MRI, with larger gains when annotated data are scarce. The approach also generalizes to other domains, as demonstrated on a brain tumor segmentation task.

Conclusion: An auxiliary, informative imaging modality available only during training can augment expert annotations and improve performance for segmentation tasks on non-contrast images across domains.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

*Mohamed Insaf Ismithdeen,Muhammad Uzair Khattak,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design profoundly affects LMM MCQA accuracy; minor phrasing changes can swing results by up to ~15%, highlighting evaluation fairness issues. The authors introduce Promptception, a framework with 61 prompt types (15 categories, 6 supercategories) to assess prompt sensitivity across 10 LMMs on 3 MCQA benchmarks, finding proprietary models more prompt-sensitive and open-source models steadier but challenged by nuanced phrasing. They propose Prompting Principles for robust, fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability in LMM performance due to prompt design, which threatens transparent, fair evaluation and reproducibility in MCQA tasks.

Method: Develop Promptception: 61 prompt types spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories. Evaluate 10 LMMs (ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro) on 3 MCQA benchmarks (MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench). Analyze sensitivity of model accuracy to prompt variations.

Result: Finding: accuracy deviations up to 15% due to prompt phrasing for certain prompts/models. Proprietary models show greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing; open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced/complex phrasing. The framework enables systematic evaluation of prompt sensitivity across model types and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Promptception enables robust, fair evaluation of LMMs by highlighting prompt sensitivity. The authors propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary vs. open-source models to improve evaluation practices and reliability.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

### [34] [SliceSemOcc: Vertical Slice Based Multimodal 3D Semantic Occupancy Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03999)
*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SliceSemOcc, a height-aware 3D occupancy method using vertical slices and SEAttention3D to boost mean IoU, especially for small objects on nuScenes datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of height-axis information and uniform height-wise channel attention in existing 3D occupancy methods, which hampers vertical feature modeling.

Method: Extract voxel features along the height axis via global and local vertical slices; apply a global-local fusion module to integrate fine-grained details with holistic context; introduce SEAttention3D to preserve height-wise resolution and assign dynamic attention weights per height layer.

Result: Significant improvement in mean IoU on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy, with pronounced gains on small-object categories; ablation studies corroborate the effectiveness of SliceSemOcc and its components.

Conclusion: Height-aware vertical-slice representation with dynamic height-wise attention enhances 3D semantic occupancy; SliceSemOcc effectively leverages height information and generalizes across datasets.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

*Solha Kang,Esla Timothy Anzaku,Wesley De Neve,Arnout Van Messem,Joris Vankerschaver,Francois Rameau,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect spurious correlations in vision transformers, showing training regime affects reliance on unintended cues, identifying easily detectable spurious signals in ImageNet classes, and including a real-world case study in invasive breast mass classification with a call for caution and robust model design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spurious correlations can cause models to rely on unintended, non-generalizable cues, undermining trustworthiness and robustness. The work targets vision transformers and large-scale datasets to understand and mitigate these signals, with implications for real-world tasks such as medical imaging.

Method: Large-scale experiments using supervised and self-supervised vision transformers on ImageNet to identify spurious cues. Analysis of class-level spurious signals, curation of affected images, and a case study on invasive breast mass classification to ground findings in real-world data.

Result: The method detects spurious correlations and shows that training methodology significantly influences reliance on such signals. Some ImageNet classes contain easily detectable spurious cues. The authors provide an exhaustive list of problematic images and discuss underlying causes, illustrating the practical relevance through a medical imaging case study.

Conclusion: Detecting and mitigating spurious correlations is crucial for trustworthy models. The findings urge caution in using certain images in future research, motivate methods to reduce reliance on unintended signals, and highlight the importance of considering training procedures and dataset design to promote generalization.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

### [36] [Learning from Majority Label: A Novel Problem in Multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04023)
*Shiku Kaito,Shinnosuke Matsuo,Daiki Suehiro,Ryoma Bise*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Learning from Majority Label (LML) framework for multi-class MIL is proposed. It introduces a Counting Network to infer bag-level majority labels and a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) to boost learning by removing minority instances. Empirical results on four datasets show improvements over conventional MIL methods, with ablations validating each component; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem tackles scenarios where bag labels are determined by the majority class, but downstream tasks require per-instance classification. This is common in fields like pathology image analysis, political voting prediction, sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring, motivating a method that leverages majority-label supervision to infer instance-level labels.

Method: Introduce Counting Network to estimate bag-level majority by counting per-class instances; propose MPEM to increase the majority proportion by pruning minority-class instances within bags; conduct analyses on LML characteristics showing efficacy when the majority is abundant; validate on four datasets with ablation studies; provide code link.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance compared with conventional MIL methods across four datasets; ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the Counting Network and MPEM modules.

Conclusion: LML provides a viable path to infer instance-level labels from majority-only bag supervision. The Counting Network and MPEM contribute to robust learning in MIL with majority labels, and code availability supports reproducibility. Future work could address scenarios with weaker majority signals and explore broader applications.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video
stream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over
98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an
innovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.

### [38] [A Re-ranking Method using K-nearest Weighted Fusion for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04050)
*Quang-Huy Che,Le-Chuong Nguyen,Gia-Nghia Tran,Dinh-Duy Phan,Vinh-Tiep Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient, unsupervised multi-view re-ranking for person re-ID using K-nearest weighted feature fusion (KWF) to mitigate view bias and improve accuracy without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: View bias and variations in pose/viewpoint/occlusion limit single-view features; leveraging multi-view representation without fine-tuning can boost re-ID performance on large datasets.

Method: Generate multi-view features by selecting K nearest neighbor features in an unsupervised manner and aggregating them with weights (KWF). Investigate weight selection strategies; no model fine-tuning or annotations required.

Result: Notable performance gains on Market1501, MSMT17, Occluded-DukeMTMC; 9.8% vs 22.0% Rank@1 improvement on MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC respectively; improved mAP; faster than other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: KWF-based re-ranking is effective, scalable, and practical for large-scale re-ID without additional supervision.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

### [39] [TEn-CATS: Text-Enriched Audio-Visual Video Parsing with Multi-Scale Category-Aware Temporal Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04086)
*Yaru Chen,Faegheh Sardari,Peiliang Zhang,Ruohao Guo,Yang Xiang,Zhenbo Li,Wenwu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised AVVP method that combines Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) and Category-Aware Temporal Graphs (CATS) to purify semantic cues and enable precise temporal propagation, yielding SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised AVVP suffers from two main issues: (a) unreliable pseudo-labels when using enhanced attention, and (b) indiscriminate spread of attention across frames when generating pseudo-labels, which amplifies early errors. There is a need to both purify semantic cues and propagate them accurately over time.

Method: Introduce BiT module for semantic injection and dynamic calibration of audio-visual features to locate richer semantic cues, followed by a CATS module for semantic propagation across time to connect and disseminate information precisely.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, LLP and UnAV-100, across multiple key indicators.

Conclusion: Combining semantic purification (BiT) with principled temporal semantic propagation (CATS) effectively addresses training-time error amplification in weakly supervised AVVP and yields SOTA performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

### [40] [TriLiteNet: Lightweight Model for Multi-Task Visual Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04092)
*Quang-Huy Che,Duc-Khai Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriLiteNet is a lightweight, multitask perception model for panoramic driving that achieves competitive accuracy on vehicle detection, drivable-area segmentation, and lane-line segmentation with very low compute costs (2.35M parameters, 7.72 GFLOPs) on BDD100k, including a tiny 0.14M-parameter config, suitable for embedded ADAS deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for real-time, energy-efficient perception in ADAS to ensure safety and responsiveness in diverse real-world environments. The work targets reducing computational demands while maintaining multi-task accuracy.

Method: A multi-task network (TriLiteNet) optimized for low computational cost and embedded deployment. The model supports three perception tasks (vehicle detection, drivable-area segmentation, lane-line segmentation) and is evaluated on the BDD100k dataset. A tiny configuration with 0.14M parameters is also proposed. Performance and efficiency are measured in terms of parameters, GFLOPs, latency, and power on embedded devices.

Result: On BDD100k, TriLiteNet_base achieves 85.6% recall for vehicle detection, 92.4% mIoU for drivable-area segmentation, and 82.3% accuracy for lane-line segmentation, with 2.35M parameters and 7.72 GFLOPs. A tiny 0.14M-parameter configuration offers a multi-task solution with even lower computational demand. The study also reports favorable latency and power characteristics on embedded devices, and provides code at the given GitHub URL.

Conclusion: TriLiteNet offers a practical, deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving by balancing perception performance with computational efficiency and scalability across multiple perception tasks.

Abstract: Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to
ensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the
real-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the
TriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related
to panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance
while maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k
dataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across
three key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line
segmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of
85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for
drivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with
only 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed
model includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides
a multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency
and power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations
shows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing
performance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a
practical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/TriLiteNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-source neuromorphic dataset, DVS-PedX, for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention analysis, combining synthetic CARLA event streams with real JAAD videos converted to DVS, with paired RGB, 33 ms DVS event frames, labels, and raw AEDAT/video data to enable sim-to-real assessment and multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety-critical pedestrian perception for event-based sensors, enabling robust detection and intention prediction under varying weather and lighting, while investigating sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation needs.

Method: Two data pipelines: (1) synthetic CARLA-generated event streams for controlled 'approach-cross' scenes with varied weather/lighting; (2) real JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using v2e, preserving background and natural behavior. Each sequence provides paired RGB frames, per-frame DVS event frames (33 ms), and frame-level labels (crossing vs. not crossing). Also released raw AEDAT 2.0/4.0 event files, AVI DVS video, and metadata. Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented with SpikingJelly to illustrate usability and to reveal sim-to-real gaps, motivating domain adaptation and multimodal fusion.

Result: The dataset demonstrates practical usability for event-based pedestrian tasks and highlights a sim-to-real gap between synthetic and real event streams. It supports benchmarking and encourages domain adaptation and fusion research.

Conclusion: DVS-PedX is positioned to accelerate research in event-based pedestrian safety, crossing-intention understanding, and neuromorphic perception, offering a versatile resource across simulated and real-world conditions.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion generates consistent multi-character story visuals from text by using an LLM-driven per-frame description workflow and a set of attention-based mechanisms with postprocessing to ensure dialogue and character consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of maintaining character consistency across frames and accurate dialogue rendering in text-to-story visualization, which leads to artifacts and disjoint storytelling.

Method: An iterative diffusion-based pipeline: (1) use a pre-trained LLM with in-context learning to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues; (2) apply a bounded attention-based per-box mask to control interactions and reduce artifacts; (3) employ identity-consistent self-attention to maintain cross-frame character consistency; (4) use region-aware cross-attention for precise object placement; (5) render dialogues as bubbles and assign them to characters via CLIPSeg.

Result: Experimental results show TaleDiffusion outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering.

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion demonstrates that combining LLM-driven content with specialized attention mechanisms and postprocessing yields coherent, dialogue-accurate multi-character storytelling visuals.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

### [43] [MEPG:Multi-Expert Planning and Generation for Compositionally-Rich Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04126)
*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEPG combines a Position-Style-Aware LLM-driven prompt decomposition with a Multi-Expert Diffusion module that routes generation across spatial regions using gated experts to enhance image quality and style diversity, with real-time spatial editing and modular extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models deliver high image quality but struggle with complex, multi-element prompts and limited stylistic diversity; there is a need for spatial-aware control and modular expert models to enable per-region styling and composition.

Method: Two components: (1) Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module using a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decompose prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style-encoded semantic instructions; (2) Multi-Expert Diffusion (MED) module that performs cross-region generation via dynamic expert routing across local regions and global areas, activating specialized models (e.g., realism, stylization) for each region through attention-based gating. Lightweight integration; extensible architecture with replaceable experts; interactive interface for real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection.

Result: MEPG significantly outperforms baseline models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: The framework provides strong extensibility and interactive control, demonstrating that integrating LLM-driven spatial-semantic prompts with region-specific expert models can improve diffusion-based image generation in both quality and stylistic variety.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tuned baseline detector using pretrained vision backbones achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, beating its own previously reported baseline by 18% and rivaling commercial detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accessible, generalizable deepfake detectors and realistic benchmarks. Prior results on in-the-wild data suggested open-source baselines lag behind commercial detectors, motivating a re-examination of simple architectures with better tuning.

Method: Revisit and fine-tune the Ojha et al. baseline that adapts standard pretrained vision backbones to generalizable deepfake detection. Evaluate on Deepfake-Eval-2024 and compare to reported baselines and commercial detectors; provide code release.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024, a notable 18% improvement over the previously reported baseline accuracy, and competitive with commercial detectors.

Conclusion: A simple, well-tuned baseline can achieve strong performance in deepfake detection on in-the-wild benchmarks. The work discusses tradeoffs among accuracy, computational cost, and interpretability, highlighting practical considerations for real-world deployment; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

*Safouane El Ghazouali,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web-based image-annotation tool that uses AI-assisted automation to dramatically reduce manual labeling effort (up to ~90%) while supporting offline operation, multiple export formats, and interactive refinement of boxes, orientated boxes, and polygons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation bottlenecks for large datasets drive the need for scalable, AI-assisted labeling interfaces that can reduce manual work without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: A hybrid AI-assisted labeling pipeline: CLIP for general cues + pre-trained detectors (e.g., Ultralytics) for common classes + zero-shot Grounding DINO for custom labels; initial low-threshold predictions to maximize recall; interactive tools for bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons; on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated via WebGPU for browser-side processing; offline operation after model caching; supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV); deduplication and disambiguation via clustering of CLIP-based components and IoU-graph-based suppression.

Result: Benchmarks on COCO-type class sets show initial predictions are largely correct and can be refined with minimal effort; VisioFirm reports up to 90% reduction in manual labeling effort while maintaining high annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: VisioFirm demonstrates an effective, scalable AI-assisted labeling workflow that combines foundation models with an efficient, offline-capable browser interface, offering flexible exports and interactive annotation tooling.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUDE is a UCIR method that disentangles object features from domain-specific styles via a text-to-image generative model and aligns these disentangled features progressively using mutual neighbors, achieving state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning 13 domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval struggles because domain styles are entangled with object features; a robust, object-centric representation is needed to bridge domain gaps.

Method: Disentangle object semantics from domain styles using a text-to-image generative model; progressively align the disentangled object features by matching mutual neighbor relationships within and across domains.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets across 13 domains; code will be released.

Conclusion: Disentangling object features with a generative-model-based approach and progressively aligning them yields strong UCIR performance, highlighting the potential of object-style disentanglement for cross-domain retrieval; future work may explore generator dependence and alignment scalability.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER is a self-evolving framework that equips Vision-Language Models with multi-step perception and precise coordinate prediction for GUI grounding. It combines Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality to generate diverse, high-quality region-focused data and adapt reasoning steps to task complexity. It shows consistent gains on ScreenSpot Pro/v2 benchmarks and achieves 55.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro after fine-tuning 7B (GTA1-7B), setting a new SoTA for 7B-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The core challenge is enabling VLMs to reason over the correct image regions in high-resolution GUI scenes with complex multi-element interactions, where existing zoom-in/active perception methods may struggle to balance accuracy and region relevance.

Method: LASER progressively endows VLMs with multi-step perception through a self-evolving loop. It integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation to jointly optimize accuracy and diversity in constructed preference data. The approach guides the model to focus on instruction-relevant key regions and adaptively allocate reasoning steps according to task complexity.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 show consistent performance gains, validating LASER. Fine-tuning LASER on GTA1-7B yields 55.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro, establishing a new state-of-the-art among 7B-scale models.

Conclusion: LASER effectively enables instruction-focused regional reasoning with adaptive multi-step perception, achieving strong gains on GUI-grounding benchmarks and setting a new SoTA for 7B-scale models.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

### [48] [Differential Morphological Profile Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04268)
*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid DMP-based dual-stream segmentation improves performance on iSAID; direct-input DMP is weaker; non-DMP baselines sometimes beat direct-input, but hybrid DMP can surpass them on mIoU, F1, Recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overhead remote sensing segmentation faces extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and very large image sizes. DMP (differential morphological profile) provides multi-scale shape cues that can enhance geometric reasoning beyond RGB features, motivating its integration into segmentation models. This work extends DMP usage from classification/detection to segmentation.

Method: Integrate DMP features into three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures via (i) direct-input: append DMP channels to network input, and (ii) hybrid dual-stream: fuse RGB and DMP encoders. Evaluate multiple DMP differentials and structuring element shapes. Experiments conducted on the iSAID remote sensing dataset.

Result: Across experiments, non-DMP models generally outperform direct-input variants, but hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and can surpass non-DMP models in mIoU, F1, and Recall.

Conclusion: A hybrid RGB+DMP dual-stream approach is a robust way to inject shape information into high-performing segmentation models for overhead imagery; direct-input DMP is less effective, though tuning DMP differentials and elements offers some gains.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

TL;DR: Text-guided 3D diffusion model synthesizes tau PET from MRI anatomy and plasma p-tau217 prompts, enabling realistic tau PET generation for disease staging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET is costly and not widely available. MRI and plasma biomarkers are more accessible and provide complementary information. A text-guided diffusion model can synthesize tau PET images conditioned on anatomy and biomarker-related text to enable augmentation and non-invasive visualization.

Method: A 3D diffusion model conditioned on MRI-derived anatomical structure and a textual prompt derived from plasma p-tau217 levels. Trained on AV1451 tau PET data from ADNI, enabling multimodal conditioning for 3D tau PET synthesis.

Result: The model generates realistic and clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across different disease stages, suitable for data augmentation, non-invasive visualization, and simulation of disease progression under varying biomarker levels.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a cost-effective alternative to tau PET visualization and may broaden tau pathology research by enabling progression simulations and augmented datasets using accessible MRI and plasma biomarkers.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

### [50] [Dual-Scale Volume Priors with Wasserstein-Based Consistency for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04273)
*Junying Meng,Gangxuan Zhou,Jun Liu,Weihong Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation method that embeds explicit image-scale volume priors and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization into the network, and enforces both per-image and dataset-wide volume consistency using Wasserstein distance constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited guidance for feature extraction and lack of robust priors in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, by integrating principled volume priors (image-scale and dataset-scale) with spatial regularization to improve segmentation consistency on unlabeled data.

Method: Incorporate an explicit image-scale volume prior and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization derived from variational models into the backbone network. Use a regression network to estimate target region volumes for unlabeled images and apply an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint so segmentation class ratios match regression predictions. Add a dataset-scale Wasserstein-distance loss based on a weak implicit volume prior to align the unlabeled data's predicted volume distribution with that of labeled data.

Result: Experimental results on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12, and thigh muscle MR images show the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to baselines (specific metrics not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: Combining explicit volume priors, variationally motivated spatial regularization, and Wasserstein-based volume-consistency losses yields state-of-the-art or superior semi-supervised segmentation performance on multiple MRI datasets.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

### [51] [PAOLI: Pose-free Articulated Object Learning from Sparse-view Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04276)
*Jianning Deng,Kartic Subr,Hakan Bilen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework learns articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images by per-articulation 3D reconstruction, a deformation field for dense pose correspondences, progressive disentanglement of static/moving parts, and joint optimization of geometry, appearance, and kinematics with cross-view/cross-pose consistency, achieving accurate representations with minimal input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing articulation-learning methods rely on dense multi-view data and ground-truth camera poses, limiting applicability. There is a need for methods that can learn from few views and no camera supervision while still capturing articulated geometry and motion.

Method: 1) Independently reconstruct each articulation using sparse-view 3D reconstruction. 2) Learn a deformation field to establish dense correspondences across poses. 3) Use progressive disentanglement to separate static vs moving parts. 4) Jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with self-supervised losses enforcing cross-view and cross-pose consistency.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and real-world data show accurate, detailed articulated representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches. The method demonstrates robustness and competitive performance with respect to baselines requiring more supervision.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective articulation learning from sparse, unposed views, reducing reliance on camera supervision and dense multi-view data, and broadening applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

### [52] [Noisy Label Refinement with Semantically Reliable Synthetic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04298)
*Yingxuan Li,Jiafeng Mao,Yusuke Matsui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using synthetic images as reliable references to identify and correct mislabeled samples in semantic-noise datasets, yielding substantial accuracy gains and complementary to existing noise-robust methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic label noise degrades supervised learning; while synthetic images provide clean labels, domain gaps limit direct use; propose leveraging them as reference points to detect and rectify mislabeled data.

Method: Generate high-quality synthetic images for each class; use them as anchors to identify mislabeled samples via similarity/prototype comparisons; relabel or discard uncertain samples; integrate with existing noise-robust training to further boost performance.

Result: Significant accuracy gains across benchmarks under semantic and real-world noise; CIFAR-10 up to +30%, CIFAR-100 up to +11% under 70% semantic noise; ImageNet-100 up to +24% under real-world noise; method is orthogonal to prior robust methods and improves when combined.

Conclusion: Synthetic-reference-based data cleaning effectively mitigates semantic noise and is compatible with state-of-the-art noise-robust training, offering substantial improvements in real-world noisy labels.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient DINO-based odd-one-out detector with ~33% fewer parameters and ~3x faster training, achieving competitive performance; plus a Multimodal LLM baseline to probe structured visual reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial and relational reasoning challenges in multi-object odd-one-out tasks while prioritizing efficiency.

Method: Develop a DINO-based model that reduces parameters by one third and training time by a factor of three; compare to state-of-the-art; introduce a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline to assess current limitations in structured visual reasoning; provide a project page for reproducibility.

Result: Maintains competitive performance despite substantial efficiency gains; the Multimodal LLM baseline yields insights into current limitations for structured visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Efficiency-focused architectures can tackle complex structured visual reasoning tasks; multimodal baselines indicate remaining gaps; further work and resources available on the project page.

Abstract: The recently introduced odd-one-out anomaly detection task involves
identifying the odd-looking instances within a multi-object scene. This problem
presents several challenges for modern deep learning models, demanding spatial
reasoning across multiple views and relational reasoning to understand context
and generalize across varying object categories and layouts. We argue that
these challenges must be addressed with efficiency in mind. To this end, we
propose a DINO-based model that reduces the number of parameters by one third
and shortens training time by a factor of three compared to the current
state-of-the-art, while maintaining competitive performance. Our experimental
evaluation also introduces a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline,
providing insights into its current limitations in structured visual reasoning
tasks. The project page can be found at

### [54] [GeoArena: An Open Platform for Benchmarking Large Vision-language Models on WorldWide Image Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04334)
*Pengyue Jia,Yingyi Zhang,Xiangyu Zhao,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open platform GeoArena evaluates LVLMs on image geolocalization using in-the-wild images and pairwise human judgments, mitigating data leakage and privacy issues, with a public leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geolocalization evaluation suffers from data leakage (pretraining on test data) and coordinate-centric metrics that reveal user location; there is a need for a realistic, privacy-preserving, human-aligned benchmark.

Method: GeoArena enables user-uploaded in-the-wild images, uses pairwise human judgments to compare model outputs, collects thousands of votes online, and provides a leaderboard for LVLMs; open, worldwide benchmarking.

Result: Launched online for two months, collected thousands of voting records, performed analysis, and established a leaderboard of LVLMs for image geolocalization.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a practical, privacy-conscious framework for fair LVLM geolocalization evaluation and promotes more trustworthy cross-model comparisons and progress in the field.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

### [55] [From Editor to Dense Geometry Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04338)
*JiYuan Wang,Chunyu Lin,Lei Sun,Rongying Liu,Lang Nie,Mingxing Li,Kang Liao,Xiangxiang Chu,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FE2E shows editing models outperform T2I generators for dense geometry estimation, by adapting a Diffusion Transformer editor for depth and normals and introducing a consistent velocity training objective and log-quantization, enabling zero-shot improvements without extra data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task; pre-trained text-to-image generators may not provide optimal priors for geometry tasks. Editing models have intrinsic structural priors that can facilitate stable convergence and superior performance when fine-tuned for deterministic geometry estimation.

Method: Introduce FE2E, adapting a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) editor for dense geometry. Replace the editor's flow matching loss with a consistent velocity objective. Apply logarithmic quantization to reconcile BFloat16 precision with high-precision tasks. Utilize DiT's global attention for joint depth and normals estimation in a single forward pass, allowing mutual supervisory signals.

Result: FE2E achieves strong zero-shot performance for monocular depth and normal estimation across datasets, including >35% gains on ETH3D and surpassing DepthAnything, which is trained on 100x more data.

Conclusion: Editing-based foundations are effective for dense geometry estimation; FE2E demonstrates that adapting an editing model with task-tailored loss and precision handling yields substantial gains, and joint depth-normal estimation benefits from global attention and mutual supervision.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

### [56] [MICACL: Multi-Instance Category-Aware Contrastive Learning for Long-Tailed Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04344)
*Feng-Qi Cui,Zhen Lin,Xinlong Rao,Anyang Tong,Shiyao Li,Fei Wang,Changlin Chen,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MICACL, a multi-instance learning framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that tackles long-tailed category distributions and complex spatio-temporal modeling using GEIIM, WIAN, MCCL, achieving state-of-the-art results on DFEW and FERV39k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFER suffers from long-tailed distributions and challenging spatio-temporal feature modeling, leading to model bias and limited generalization; existing methods do not adequately address these issues.

Method: Proposes MICACL with GEIIM for adaptive spatio-temporal interactions using adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions; WIAN for weighted instance aggregation; MCCL for multiscale category-aware contrastive learning to balance training across major/minor categories.

Result: Experiments on in-the-wild datasets DFEW and FERV39k show MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively mitigates bias due to data imbalance and modeling complexity, offering a robust, generalizable solution for dynamic facial expression recognition.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: Transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic summaries using monocular SLAM to map trajectory, cluster key viewpoints, and stitch representative frames into panoramas for quick situational awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders accumulate lengthy videos; fast, reliable summaries are needed for rapid understanding and decision-making during incidents.

Method: Apply monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectory and reconstruct scene; cluster poses along the trajectory to identify key viewpoints; select representative frames from each cluster; fuse selected frames into spatially coherent panoramas via multi-frame stitching.

Result: Abstract claims the summaries enable rapid understanding and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review; no quantitative results provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: A practical pipeline that yields concise panoramic summaries from body-worn footage to improve situational awareness in time-critical scenarios.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM introduces a coarse-to-fine LMM-based framework for text-based person anomaly search with a zero-shot adaptation recipe, achieving modest gains on PAB and providing interpretable alignment between text and actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle fine-grained cross-modal alignment for textual anomaly descriptions with visual behaviors and address data scarcity by leveraging LMMs, while mitigating domain gap and deployment efficiency.

Method: A coarse-to-fine pipeline that leverages large multi-modal models to fuse generative world knowledge with retrieval; a training-free adaptation cookbook: masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking for zero-shot anomaly cues.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines by +0.96% Recall@1 on the PAB dataset; qualitative analysis shows interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors.

Conclusion: First study to explore LMMs for text-based person anomaly search; offers an efficient deployment path and will release code and models to support future research.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASE-MLLM introduces an end-to-end framework that injects image aesthetic saliency into Multimodal LLMs for Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) via the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) and IAS-ViT, achieving state-of-the-art results on AIC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in AIC where prior work focuses on predicting aesthetic ratings or uses generic MLLMs without tailoring to aesthetic content; aims to align caption content with image aesthetics by modeling aesthetic saliency.

Method: Propose ASE-MLLM with Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic saliency features; use IAS-ViT as image encoder; fuse aesthetic saliency with image features via a cross-attention mechanism; train end-to-end for AIC.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements over traditional methods and generic MLLMs on mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: First framework to explicitly incorporate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs for AIC tasks; demonstrates the effectiveness of saliency-guided multimodal fusion in generating aesthetically descriptive captions.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-prior guided 3D style transfer pipeline that stylizes key views and transfers to 3D representations, using cross-view attention and instance-level transfer to ensure style fidelity, consistency, and structured 3D outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle to extract high-level style semantics from reference images and often produce results with weak structural separation across objects, especially in complex or 360-degree scenes. Leveraging pretrained 2D diffusion priors aims to capture richer style semantics and enforce multi-view consistency.

Method: 1) Use diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints. 2) Transfer these stylized key views onto the 3D representation. 3) Cross-view style alignment by inserting cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of the UNet to enable feature interactions across multiple key views. 4) Instance-level style transfer by leveraging instance-level consistency across stylized key views and transferring it to the 3D model.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree environments.

Conclusion: Integrating diffusion priors with cross-view attention and instance-level transfer yields more structured, coherent, and artistically rich stylizations in 3D scenes and demonstrates strong generalization across viewpoints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

*Tingyou Li,Zixin Xu,Zirui Gao,Hanfei Yan,Xiaojing Huang,Jizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised implicit neural representation framework (PtyINR) jointly recovers unknown X-ray ptychography object and probe from raw diffraction data without probe pre-characterization, achieving high-quality, robust reconstructions under low-signal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unkown-probe ptychography presents a major challenge for accurate reconstruction; conventional iterative methods and deep learning struggles under low-signal, low-dose, or high-speed imaging, hindering widespread adoption.

Method: Propose PtyINR, parameterizing object and probe as continuous implicit neural representations; perform end-to-end, self-supervised reconstruction directly from diffraction patterns without prior probe characterization.

Result: Demonstrates superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data; shows strong robustness in low-signal conditions; offers a generalizable, physics-informed approach for probe-dependent inverse problems in computational microscopy.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a generalizable framework for simultaneous object-probe recovery in ptychography, enabling more accurate, robust reconstructions without probe pre-characterization and extending to other probe-dependent inverse problems in microscopy.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-first, self-adaptive dataset construction approach for RMS in multimodal LLMs, producing 35k image-text-guide pairs and a standardized safety evaluation metric via a fine-tuned safety judge; claims scalable effectiveness demonstrated by extensive experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented datasets do not capture the complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS) and lack a unified evaluation metric, hindering reliable assessment and safety improvements for MLLMs.

Method: Image-oriented pipeline: start from images, automatically generate paired text and guidance responses; create RMS dataset with 35k image-text-guidance pairs. Propose a standardized evaluation metric by fine-tuning a safety judge model and testing on diverse safety datasets.

Result: Experimental results across various tasks show the method is scalable and effective, validating the image-oriented approach for RMS data construction and evaluation.

Conclusion: Image-oriented self-adaptive RMS dataset construction, combined with a standardized safety evaluation metric, offers a scalable path to realistic multimodal safety data and consistent assessment of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

### [63] [Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406)
*Zanwei Zhou,Taoran Yi,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Lingxi Xie,Xinggang Wang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDT-dist introduces few-step 3D flow distillation via Velocity Matching and Velocity Distillation to learn Marginal-Data Transport, achieving 1–2 steps with substantial speedups on TRELLIS while maintaining fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D flow models suffer from long inference due to many sampling steps; while few-step diffusion distillation (notably Consistency Models) has advanced 2D generation, it remains under-explored for 3D tasks. Directly optimizing Marginal-Data Transport is intractable, motivating proxy objectives that enable efficient few-step distillation.

Method: Propose MDT-dist framework that distills a pretrained model to learn Marginal-Data Transport. Introduce two optimizable objectives: Velocity Matching (VM) to align velocity fields between teacher and student; Velocity Distillation (VD) to perform probability density distillation using the learned velocities. This converts the transport-level objective into velocity- and distribution-level optimizations, enabling efficient few-step 3D flow distillation. Evaluated by applying to TRELLIS, a pioneer 3D generation framework.

Result: Reducing sampling steps per flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2; latency of 0.68s (1 step × 2) and 0.94s (2 steps × 2) on A800; 9.0× and 6.5× speedups; high visual and geometric fidelity preserved; MDT-dist significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior few-step 3D generation.

Conclusion: MDT-dist enables efficient few-step 3D flow distillation and yields substantial speedups without sacrificing quality, suggesting broad applicability to fast, high-fidelity 3D generation with flow-based models and potential extension beyond TRELLIS.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

### [64] [Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434)
*Hyunsoo Cha,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Durian presents zero-shot portrait animation with dual reference networks for attribute transfer in a diffusion framework, training via self-reconstruction, and keypoint-based mask expansion; enables robust, multi-attribute, single-pass composition achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity, spatially-consistent attribute transfer across video frames in portrait animation without explicit triplet supervision, robust to misalignment and varying attribute extents.

Method: Dual reference networks inject spatial features from portrait and attribute into diffusion denoising; self-reconstruction training using two frames from the same portrait video; mask expansion via keypoint-conditioned image generation; data augmentations for robustness; no explicit triplet supervision.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer; dual-reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.

Conclusion: The approach generalizes across diverse attributes and in-the-wild references, offering robust, flexible, and efficient portrait animation with attribute transfer in a single pass.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

*Benjamin El-Zein,Dominik Eckert,Andreas Fieselmann,Christopher Syben,Ludwig Ritschl,Steffen Kappler,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-constrained deep learning method uses a differentiable Hough-transform to segment polygonal collimation shadows in X-ray images, producing refined line-constrained ROI masks with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3–5.0 mm on real data; scalable to more than four borders by leveraging the polygonal prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To robustly detect and segment collimation shadows in radiographs despite edge obscuration from scatter, leveraging the prior that collimation produces polygonal shadows to improve ROI localization and radiation dose control.

Method: A deep learning segmentation model constrained by geometry via a differentiable Hough-transform network that detects collimation borders and refines the ROI center. During inference, border detection and ROI information are fused to yield line-constrained segmentation masks. The approach is designed to handle up to four borders, without being fundamentally limited to that number.

Result: Median Hausdorff distance of 4.3–5.0 mm on diverse real X-ray test sets, demonstrating robust reconstruction of collimated regions.

Conclusion: A geometry-aware, differentiable Hough-transform-based segmentation framework can robustly reconstruct polygonal collimation shadows in X-ray imaging and provide reliable ROI delineation, not fundamentally limited by the number of edges.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Jun-Kun Chen,Aayush Bansal,Minh Phuoc Vo,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A long-video generative model for virtual try-on (VFR) that autoregressively generates videos segment-by-segment, ensuring local smoothness via a prefix condition and global temporal consistency via a 360° anchor video, enabling arbitrarily long, minute-scale virtual try-on videos without data-heavy or resource-intensive generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable arbitrarily long, realistic virtual try-on videos efficiently, addressing the challenges of local smoothness and global temporal coherence without requiring massive video datasets or heavy computation.

Method: Autoregressive, segment-by-segment video generation with a prefix video condition to ensure local smoothness; uses an anchor 360-degree video to enforce global consistency of the wearer’s appearance across segments; supports generation of arbitrarily long videos with minute-scale duration.

Result: Demonstrates capability to produce minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, enabling long-form VTON video generation and reducing data/computation requirements.

Conclusion: A pioneering framework for long virtual try-on video generation that offers flexible-length outputs and coherence across segments; future work could address more complex clothing dynamics, improved evaluation, and real-world deployment considerations.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

### [67] [The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04438)
*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM) to evaluate cross-modal learning stability in vision-language models via cyclic I2T/T2I generations, introducing metrics MCD, SDR, MGG and a new ND400 benchmark; reveals semantic drift and the need for cyclic consistency in evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in standard single-pass I2T/T2I evaluations; need to measure semantic drift and cross-modal stability across cycles, to ensure unified models truly share representations.

Method: Introduce UCF-UM cyclic evaluation protocol alternating I2T and T2I over multiple generations; define three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG); create ND400 benchmark sourced from NoCaps and DOCCI; evaluate seven recent models including BAGEL and Vila-u; release code.

Result: Found substantial variation in cross-modal stability across models; some models maintain semantics (BAGEL) over many alternations, others drift quickly (Vila-u); cyclic consistency is a necessary complement to standard evaluations.

Conclusion: Cyclic evaluation reveals cross-modal stability and shared representation quality not captured by single-pass metrics; provides practical metrics to assess unified models' cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations; extends generalization beyond COCO via ND400; encourages robust evaluation of unified vision-language models.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of panoramic vision focusing on perspective-to-panorama adaptation, outlining projection-related challenges, surveying 20+ tasks, and offering guidelines and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) offer a 360° field of view for spatial intelligence in VR, autonomous driving, and robotics, but their geometric differences from perspective images make direct domain transfer difficult; a dedicated survey is needed to summarize methods and chart future paths.

Method: Review the panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods; identify three core adaptation challenges (pole distortions, non-uniform ERP sampling, and periodic boundary continuity); curate 20+ tasks from 300+ papers; perform cross-method and cross-task analyses; classify tasks into four categories (visual quality, understanding, multimodal understanding, visual generation); discuss data, models, and applications and outline future directions; provide a project page.

Result: Identification of three dominant challenges in panoramic vision (geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform sampling in ERP, and boundary continuity); synthesis of 20+ tasks into four overarching categories; cross-method and cross-task analyses that highlight strategies tailored to panoramic-specific challenges; discussion of data, model, and application directions and open challenges; provision of a forward-looking agenda for data, models, and applications with a project page for reference.

Conclusion: The survey consolidates panoramic vision knowledge, clarifies its unique challenges, and offers structured guidance for future work across data, models, and applications, aiming to accelerate progress in panoramic perception and generation.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

TL;DR: Plot'n Polish enables zero-shot, cross-frame consistent story visuals with multi-level detail control in diffusion-based image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As text-to-image diffusion models are used for storytelling, creators need flexible edits and post-generation refinements that preserve narrative and visual coherence across frames.

Method: A zero-shot framework, Plot'n Polish, that provides consistent story generation and fine-grained control over story visualizations at varying detail levels, enabling edits and refinements across a sequence without retraining.

Result: Demonstrates improved consistency and controllability of story visuals across frames, enabling narrative-coherent edits without retraining.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish offers a practical, zero-shot solution for controlled, coherent story visualization in diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

*Zehong Yan,Peng Qi,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST-VL is a unified vision-language model for multimodal misinformation detection across textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions. It uses a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier to extract task-specific visual features and is trained with TRUST-Instruct (198K samples with structured reasoning aligned to fact-check workflows). It achieves state-of-the-art results in both in-domain and zero-shot settings, with strong generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spans multiple modalities and distortion types; existing detectors typically target a single distortion and fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. A unified, explainable approach that enables knowledge sharing across distortion types is needed.

Method: Jointly train TRUST-VL across distortion types; incorporate a Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module to extract task-specific visual features; build TRUST-Instruct, a 198K-sample instruction dataset with structured reasoning aligned to human fact-checking workflows; evaluate on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks; demonstrates strong generalization across distortion types; provides improved interpretability through reasoning chains and the visual amplifier.

Conclusion: A unified, explainable model can effectively detect multimodal misinformation by sharing knowledge across distortion types and leveraging task-specific visual features, powered by large-scale instruction data.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

TL;DR: Converts GUI episode sequences into graph-structured page representations, leverages retrieval-augmented generation to guide perception, and introduces PG-Agent for better generalization with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents rely on sequential episodes and fail to capture the complex transition relationships between GUI pages. Representing pages as a graph can improve environment perception and generalization to new scenarios.

Method: Transform sequential episodes into page graphs that model page transitions; apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve reliable GUI perception guidelines from the graphs; propose a multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition and inject the guidelines to enable generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PG-Agent, achieving improvements even when the page graph is constructed from limited episodes.

Conclusion: Modeling GUI environments as page graphs and guiding agents with RAG-derived guidelines within a multi-agent decomposition framework enhances generalization and performance, especially with scarce training episodes.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

*João P. Arroyo,João G. Rodrigues,Daniel Lawand,Denis D. Mauá,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Alex Gray,Eduardo R. Laurentino,Fabio G. Cozman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work studies partially identifiable queries in quasi-Markovian acyclic SCMs with observed endogenous variables and uncertain exogenous confounders, and introduces optimization-based methods (including column generation) to compute tight probability bounds, achieving polynomial-size exogenous representations for single interventions and showing empirically superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In causal inference, when exogenous confounders are not fully specified, many probabilities cannot be exactly computed. The paper aims to obtain tight probability bounds under partial identifiability, leveraging available endogenous distributions.

Method: Model the system as a Bayesian network with non-unique root distributions due to unknown exogenous variables. Formulate bound computation as multilinear programming; simplify the construction of programs by exploiting known endogenous probabilities. For a single intervention, apply column generation to solve a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, enabling a polynomial-size representation of exogenous variables.

Result: The proposed column-generation approach yields tighter and more scalable bounds than existing methods and demonstrates that a polynomial-size exogenous-variable representation suffices for single-intervention scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates feasible and scalable tight-bounding of probabilities in partially identifiable quasi-Markovian acyclic SCMs, introducing a practical algorithmic framework (column generation) to exploit endogenous probabilities and achieve polynomial-size representations for single interventions.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, multimodal policy (Diffusion-AC) for conflict detection/resolution in air traffic management, augmented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum; achieves higher success and substantially fewer NMACs in high-density scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL-based CD&R policies suffer from unimodal bias and decision deadlocks under dynamic, safety-critical constraints; a diffusion approach with multimodal outputs offers flexible, safety-oriented planning.

Method: Model policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function; use diffusion probabilistic models; introduce Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC) to train from sparse to dense traffic; compare to state-of-the-art DRL baselines via simulations.

Result: Outperforms baselines; in high-density scenarios, 94.1% success and ~59% reduction in NMACs relative to next-best baseline; multimodal decisions enable switching to alternative maneuvers.

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC provides safer, more flexible CD&R with better safety margins; the curriculum aids stable learning; diffusion-based approach mitigates unimodal bias in DRL for air traffic management.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces dynamic planning for LLM agents to allocate test-time compute adaptively; a two-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning on synthetic data, then RL) improves sample efficiency and enables steering by human plans, demonstrated in Crafter; first work to tackle dynamic compute allocation in sequential decision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and degraded long-horizon performance of always-planning approaches and enable flexible, controllable planning that can be allocated at test time.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework for dynamic planning and a two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime dynamic planning, and (2) reinforcement learning to refine this capability in long-horizon environments; empirical evaluation in Crafter showing improved efficiency and objective complexity; demonstration that human-written plans can steer agents.

Result: Dynamic planning agents are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives; they can be steered by human plans, surpassing their independent capabilities.

Conclusion: First exploration of training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making, paving the way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

*Zahra Zehtabi Sabeti Moghaddam,Zeinab Dehghani,Maneeha Rani,Koorosh Aslansefat,Bhupesh Kumar Mishra,Rameez Raja Kureshi,Dhavalkumar Thakker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-SMILE is a perturbation-based, method-agnostic framework that explains Graph RAG by identifying influential KG entities/relations, yielding stable, human-aligned explanations and improving transparency and trust without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can hallucinate and rely on opaque grounding. RAG helps ground outputs but remains a black box and data-dependent. There is a need for token- and component-level interpretability in Graph RAG to improve reliability in sensitive domains.

Method: Apply controlled perturbations to the Graph RAG pipeline, compute similarities, and train weighted linear surrogates (KG-SMILE) to quantify which graph entities/relations most influence outputs; provide token- and component-level explanations using SMILE.

Result: KG-SMILE yields stable, human-aligned explanations with strong fidelity/faithfulness/consistency/stability and accuracy, indicating a balance between model performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: A method-agnostic framework that enhances Graph RAG transparency, fostering greater trust in ML systems, particularly in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

### [76] [CausalARC: Abstract Reasoning with Causal World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03636)
*Jacqueline Maasch,John Kalantari,Kia Khezeli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduce CausalARC, a causal-world testbed for AI reasoning under low data and distribution shift; uses structural causal models and principled data augmentations to supply observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback; evaluates LM reasoning across four settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning performance degrades with limited data and distribution shift. A controlled, causally grounded testbed is needed to study generalization and to compare reasoning abilities. CausalARC uses explicit world-models and data-augmentation feedback to probe abstractions and reasoning.

Method: Tasks are sampled from a fully specified structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational, interventional, and counterfactual feedback via few-shot in-context demonstrations. Proof-of-concept evaluates four LM settings: (1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with logical reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and versatility of CausalARC as a testing ground for LM reasoning under low data and distribution shifts; provides a structured framework and evaluation settings, rather than reporting final performance metrics.

Conclusion: CausalARC offers a controlled experimental platform for evaluating AI reasoning under data scarcity and distribution shift, enabling systematic study of causal-world modeling and data augmentation strategies and guiding future LM evaluations in abstract, counterfactual, programmatic, and causal-discovery tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

### [77] [Towards a Neurosymbolic Reasoning System Grounded in Schematic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03644)
*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic image-schema representations derived from sensorimotor experience, and uses declarative spatial reasoning in Answer Set Programming to guide LLMs and render executable, interpretable programs for logical deduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at pattern recognition but struggle with robust, human-like logical reasoning due to fragile mental representations. Grounding reasoning in embodied, schematic structures (image schemas) and providing executable, symbolic representations can enhance interpretability and reliability of reasoning.

Method: Propose Embodied-LM, which encodes spatial cognitive structures (image schemas) as declarative spatial rules, implemented in Answer Set Programming. The LLM is guided to interpret scenarios through these embodied schemas, with the structured schemas formalized as executable ASP programs that can perform logical deduction, enabling interpretable reasoning.

Result: Shows that LLMs can be steered to interpret scenarios via embodied cognitive structures; these structures can be formalized as executable programs; the resulting representations support effective, interpretable logical reasoning. The evaluation focuses on spatial primitives and establishes a computational foundation for incorporating more complex, dynamic representations.

Conclusion: Embodied-LM demonstrates that grounding reasoning in image-schema based, executable, spatial representations can improve interpretability and reliability of logical reasoning in LLMs. While currently focused on spatial primitives, the approach lays groundwork for richer, dynamic cognitive representations and broader neurosymbolic integration.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

### [78] [Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646)
*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-enabled LLM reasoning follows a hierarchical two-phase dynamic, with a bottleneck at high-level strategic planning. The paper introduces HICRA, a credit-assignment method that concentrates updates on planning tokens, achieving strong gains over baselines, and shows semantic entropy outperforms token entropy as a measure of strategic exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the mechanisms by which reinforcement learning boosts LLM reasoning and to address inefficiencies in existing methods by targeting the strategic bottleneck in planning.

Method: Empirical analysis of phenomena (aha moments, length-scaling, entropy dynamics) to reveal a two-phase hierarchy; proposal of HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA) that focuses optimization on high-impact planning tokens; validation against strong baselines (e.g., GRPO) and evaluation of semantic entropy as a metric for strategic exploration.

Result: HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, confirming that targeting the strategic bottleneck improves reasoning. Semantic entropy provides a superior signal for guiding exploration over token-level entropy.

Conclusion: Reasoning in RL-enabled LLMs follows a hierarchical, two-phase process with a critical planning bottleneck. Addressing this bottleneck via targeted credit assignment yields substantial gains, and semantic entropy serves as a better compass for strategic exploration than token entropy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

### [79] [An Empirical Evaluation of Factors Affecting SHAP Explanation of Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03649)
*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Eight time series segmentation methods were evaluated for SHAP-based attribution in time series classification. Equal-length segmentation often outperforms bespoke segmentation strategies, and a length-weighted normalization improves attribution quality. The number of segments is more influential than the specific segmentation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XAI for Time Series Classification (TSC) aims to explain predictions efficiently. SHAP is accurate but computationally expensive for long series; segmentation-based aggregation can accelerate SHAP, but optimal segmentation strategy is unclear. This work investigates how segment composition affects explanation quality and seeks a robust, efficient approach.

Method: Evaluate eight segmentation algorithms on both multivariate (MTS) and univariate (UTS) time series. Use SHAP-based attribution aggregated over segments, with two evaluation frameworks: InterpretTime and AUC Difference. Propose a normalization technique that weights segments by their length and assess its impact.

Result: Number of segments has a larger impact on explanation quality than the segmentation method. Equal-length segmentation consistently outperforms most custom methods. A novel length-weighted attribution normalization improves attribution quality across experiments.

Conclusion: For SHAP-based explanations in TSC, using equal-length segmentation is robust and often superior; segment-length weighting improves attribution quality, offering a practical, scalable approach without heavily tuning the segmentation method.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

### [80] [PersonaTeaming: Exploring How Introducing Personas Can Improve Automated AI Red-Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03728)
*Wesley Hanwen Deng,Sunnie S. Y. Kim,Akshita Jha,Ken Holstein,Motahhare Eslami,Lauren Wilcox,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaTeaming introduces persona-based mutations to automated red-teaming, using red-teaming expert and regular user personas, plus a dynamic persona generator and mutation-distance metrics, achieving up to 144.1% attack-rate gains over RainbowPlus while preserving diversity, and discusses integration with human red-teaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated red-teaming currently ignores the influence of human identities and backgrounds on risk discovery. The paper argues that incorporating personas can broaden the spectrum of adversarial strategies and surface risks that automated methods might miss, enabling a closer alignment with human red-teaming practices.

Method: Mutate prompts using red-teaming expert and regular user personas; develop a dynamic algorithm to generate diverse persona types adaptive to seed prompts; introduce mutation-distance metrics to quantify how far generated prompts deviate from seeds; compare performance against RainbowPlus.

Result: Empirical results show up to 144.1% improvement in attack success rates of adversarial prompts with persona mutations while maintaining prompt diversity; provides a qualitative assessment of strengths/limitations of different persona types and mutation strategies; discusses opportunities for combining automated and human red-teaming.

Conclusion: PersonaTeaming can complement both automated and human red-teaming by broadening the attack surface through identity-informed prompt mutations, though careful consideration of biases and limitations is needed; outlines future directions to explore collaborations between automated and human adversarial methods.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

### [81] [The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03730)
*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show evolving trait-like expressions that respond to training and alignment but self-reports poorly predict actual behavior; persona tweaks alter self-perception more than behavior; surface traits differ from behavioral consistency, challenging current assumptions about LLM personality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to rigorously evaluate LLM personality beyond self-reports by examining trait emergence, predictive validity, and intervention effects, thereby informing alignment and interpretability.

Method: systematic analysis across three aspects: (1) tracking trait profiles over training stages; (2) testing predictive validity of self-reported traits on behavioral tasks; (3) applying interventions (e.g., persona injection, RLHF, instruction tuning) and assessing effects on self-reports and behavior.

Result: instructional alignment stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways resembling human data; self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior and often diverge from human patterns; persona injection shifts self-reports toward the intended direction but has limited or inconsistent impact on actual behavior.

Conclusion: distinguish surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency; current assumptions about LLM personality may be overstated; emphasize deeper behavioral validation, more robust alignment, and careful interpretation of self-reports in LLMs.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show internal inconsistencies across models and sizes, undermining their use as substitutes for real participants in human-subject research, despite sometimes producing human-like outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address whether LLM-based agents maintain stable internal states across different experimental settings, a core assumption behind substituting human participants with AI in experiments.

Method: Design a study to reveal agents' internal state and observe behavior in basic dialogue; formulate behavioral hypotheses about alignment between revealed state and conversation; test across model families and sizes.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies across model families and sizes; while agents can generate responses similar to humans, their internal state is not stable or coherent across settings.

Conclusion: Internal inconsistency is a critical limitation for substituting real participants; need to account for this and consider more robust evaluation; code/data are publicly available.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

*Connor Walker,Koorosh Aslansefat,Mohammad Naveed Akram,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAGuard enhances RAG with dual retrieval and a safety-focused extension to boost safety recall while maintaining technical depth in Offshore Wind maintenance decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical offshore maintenance demands strong safety assurance in LLM-enabled guidance. Conventional LLMs can fail in specialized or unexpected scenarios, risking safety and reliability.

Method: Parallel queries to two indices with separate budgets for knowledge and safety; introduce SafetyClamp to fetch a larger candidate pool and enforce hard-slot safety guarantees; evaluate across sparse (BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval), and hybrid retrieval, measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K.

Result: Safety Recall@K rises from near 0% in standard RAG to over 50% with RAGuard, while Technical Recall@K remains above ~60% across retrieval paradigms.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp can establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) built on large language models to understand domain knowledge, plan, adapt, and produce evidence-based reports; deployed at JD.com, reducing labor and improving planning metrics such as accuracy and stock availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain planning is highly complex, involving demand forecasting, inventory, operations, and replenishment across multiple stakeholders. Challenges include collecting data from e-commerce platforms, formulating long-term plans, adapting to environmental changes, and maintaining interpretability, efficiency, and reliability. Advances in AI and large language models offer new capabilities to reason, decompose tasks, and orchestrate tools for practical SCM planning.

Method: Develop a Supply Chain Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge, infer operator needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create tools, and generate evidence-based planning reports. The approach is validated in a real-world setting at JD.com to demonstrate feasibility and benefits of LLM-driven agents for SCM.

Result: The SCPA framework effectively reduces labor and improves key metrics such as accuracy and stock availability, among others, in a real-world JD.com deployment.

Conclusion: LLM-enabled agents for supply chain planning are feasible and beneficial. The SCPA demonstrates how domain understanding, task decomposition, tool orchestration, and evidence-based reporting can support long-term planning and dynamic adaptation in supply chains.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decentralized meta-cognitive policy framework for multi-agent LLMs (MPDF) that learns adaptive strategies using three high-level actions (Persist, Refine, Concede); paired with a novel RL method SoftRankPO to stabilize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-agent LLM systems rely on fixed collaboration protocols and treat agents as passive executors, ignoring internal cognitive states like uncertainty and confidence. This meta-cognitive blindspot motivates learning adaptive, deliberative policies to improve reasoning.

Method: MPDF trains distributed policies over meta-cognitive actions (Persist, Refine, Concede) in a decentralized manner. To stabilize policy gradient learning, SoftRankPO reshapes advantages using the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making optimization robust to reward variance.

Result: MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves ~4–5% absolute improvement in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: The work proposes a shift from fixed collaboration protocols to learned, dynamic, meta-cognitive strategies for multi-agent LLM systems, highlighting the promise of adaptive deliberation in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

TL;DR: Novel benchmark and automated pipeline use LLMs to inform homelessness policy across four geographies, integrating Capability Approach concepts and agent-based modeling; shows potential for scalable policy insights with guardrails and expert collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can process vast unstructured data and explore scenarios, but alignment with domain experts and local context is critical for high-stakes policy areas like homelessness.

Method: Construct a decision-scenario benchmark across four cities, grounded in the Capability Approach; automate linking benchmark policies to an agent-based model; run simulated social scenarios to assess impact of policies; compare LLM outputs to expert judgments (and among themselves).

Result: Initial findings indicate LLMs can offer policy alternatives at scale and have promising potential for informing social policymaking when used with guardrails and expert collaboration.

Conclusion: Responsible guardrails and local contextual calibration with domain experts are essential for leveraging LLMs to provide valuable policy insights at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OMOP mapping is labor-intensive and error-prone; LLMs risk hallucinations; need safe, scalable approach to leverage LLMs for clinical terminology mapping.

Method: Developed MCP-based framework enabling LLMs to interact with external resources; zero-training approach; provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs; ensures explainability and secure interactions.

Result: Significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort; real-time lookups and structured outputs suitable for exploratory and production use.

Conclusion: MCP-based, zero-training LLM mapping system can safely deploy LLMs for OMOP CDM terminology mapping with reduced hallucinations and improved explainability, bridging development and production environments.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Method: A multidimensional AI-powered framework combining: (1) focal point extraction from tourist photos via a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model to identify visual attention areas; (2) color theme analysis using clustering to derive dominant colors and map their spatial distribution; (3) comparison of color themes between social media images and real-world street views to detect shifts; (4) hybrid sentiment analysis on tourist reviews using a rule-based approach plus a multi-task BERT model, assessing satisfaction across four dimensions: tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business formats.

Result: The approach reveals spatial variation in aesthetic appeal and emotional responses, with notable shifts between social media visuals and real-world views. Divergence suggests gaps between visitor expectations and the built environment, reflecting stylistic preferences and perceptual biases, and demonstrates the framework’s ability to decode tourist perception for informed decision-making in tourism, heritage conservation, and public-space design.

Conclusion: This integrated, data-driven framework provides a holistic tool to decode tourist perception in historic quarters, enabling sustainable preservation and more aesthetically engaging, human-centered urban spaces through evidence-based planning.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

### [89] [Continuous Monitoring of Large-Scale Generative AI via Deterministic Knowledge Graph Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03857)
*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Hasmot Ali,Marufa Kamal,Syed Bahauddin Alam,Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework to monitor and evaluate GEN AI reliability by comparing a deterministic KG (rule-based) with a real-time, LLM-generated KG derived from streams like live news, using structural/semantic metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) and dynamic anomaly thresholds to detect hallucinations and drift in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEN AI evaluation relies heavily on subjective human judgments and can be biased and non-scalable. Black-box models and semantic drift (hallucinations, biases) necessitate transparent, scalable metrics. Real-time KGs from live data provide an objective, up-to-date benchmark that is less susceptible to training data memorization.

Method: Construct two parallel KGs: (1) deterministic KG built with explicit rules, ontologies, dictionaries, and extracted relations; (2) LLM-generated KG built from real-time textual streams (e.g., live news). Compute KG metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) to quantify deviations. Implement automated real-time monitoring that flags anomalies when deviations exceed thresholds derived from historical metric distributions, enabling proactive detection of semantic anomalies/hallucinations.

Result: No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the paper proposes a framework. The stated outcome is a robust, scalable evaluation approach that enables real-time, metric-driven comparisons between a deterministic KG and an LLM-generated KG to detect semantic deviations.

Conclusion: The authors present a dynamic KG-based evaluation framework that leverages deterministic and real-time LLM-derived graphs to monitor GEN AI reliability, offering objective, scalable anomaly detection in place of subjective human assessments.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

### [90] [Expedition & Expansion: Leveraging Semantic Representations for Goal-Directed Exploration in Continuous Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03863)
*Sina Khajehabdollahi,Gautier Hamon,Marko Cvjetko,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,Clément Moulin-Frier,Cédric Colas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid exploration method for continuous cellular automata that alternates local novelty-based expansions with goal-directed expeditions using a Vision-Language Model to generate linguistic goals. This approach improves diversity and interpretability of discovered patterns beyond traditional novelty search, with expeditions driving long-term exploration and revealing new behavioral niches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of exploring vast, high-dimensional CA behavior spaces where traditional novelty search often stalls due to local novelty plateaus and redundancy, and to enhance interpretability by aligning exploration with human-understandable concepts.

Method: Iteratively alternate between local novelty-driven expansions and expeditions. During expeditions, use a Vision-Language Model to produce linguistic goals describing interesting yet hypothetical patterns, steering exploration toward uncharted regions in semantic space. Evaluate on Flow Lenia and perform genealogical analysis to assess influence of expedition-born solutions on long-term search.

Result: E&E discovers more diverse CA solutions than existing exploration methods. Genealogical analysis shows expedition-origin solutions disproportionately shape long-term exploration, uncovering new behavioral niches that act as stepping stones for ongoing search.

Conclusion: E&E effectively breaks local novelty boundaries and enables human-aligned, interpretable, open-ended exploration in artificial life, offering a robust template that could generalize to other domains beyond Flow Lenia.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

*Yineng Yan,Xidong Wang,Jin Seng Cheng,Ran Hu,Wentao Guan,Nahid Farahmand,Hengte Lin,Yue Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-powered agentic assistant (FaMA) reframes marketplace interactions as conversational tasks, improving efficiency by replacing GUI-heavy workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce friction in C2C e-commerce by moving from complex GUIs to an agentic, natural-language interface that can plan, remember, and act on tasks like listing updates, bulk messaging, and product discovery.

Method: Proposes FaMA architecture; uses an LLM-based agent to interpret natural language commands, automate high-friction workflows for sellers and buyers; treats the agent as a conversational entry point to the marketplace and evaluates the system via experiments.

Result: FaMA achieves 98% task success on marketplace tasks and up to 2× speedup in interaction time.

Conclusion: An agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight, accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, enabling more efficient marketplace management.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

*Qika Lin,Yifan Zhu,Bin Pu,Ling Huang,Haoran Luo,Jingying Ma,Zhen Peng,Tianzhe Zhao,Fangzhi Xu,Jian Zhang,Kai He,Zhonghong Ou,Swapnil Mishra,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1 is a chest X-ray medical foundation model that generates answers with localized reasoning tied to image regions, trained in a staged pipeline and reinforced online; it shows superior performance over several baselines in report generation and VQA and is evaluated with a new Report Arena benchmark and expert interpretability assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models are often black-boxes and lack transparent, locally grounded interpretability, hindering clinical deployment. There is a need for holistic, interpretable, and clinically actionable CXR interpretation models.

Method: A sequential training pipeline: (1) fine-tuning on curated CXR instruction data to establish basic CXR interpretation capabilities; (2) exposing the model to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start reasoning; (3) online reinforcement learning to enhance grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. The model outputs both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image regions. Evaluation uses Report Arena benchmarking and expert reviews comparing interpretability and plausibility against baselines.

Result: Quantitative gains include 14.54% and 31.32% improvements in report generation over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma, and 57.75% and 23.06% improvements in visual question answering over MedGemma and CheXagent. Expert reviews show greater interpretability and clinical plausibility of DeepMedix-R1's reasoning steps (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference against Qwen2.5-VL-7B).

Conclusion: This work advances medical foundation model development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable CXR interpretation, with explicit emphasis on local-grounded reasoning and evaluation through expert feedback and a dedicated benchmarking framework.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

### [93] [Handling Infinite Domain Parameters in Planning Through Best-First Search with Delayed Partial Expansions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03953)
*Ángel Aso-Mollar,Diego Aineto,Enrico Scala,Eva Onaindia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A best-first heuristic search over infinite control-parameter decision spaces with delayed partial expansion achieves completeness in the limit and is competitive with existing planning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control parameters are often treated as embedded constraints rather than true decision points, which can limit search effectiveness and completeness. Explicitly handling control parameters as decision variables in the search space aims to improve planning performance and theoretical guarantees.

Method: Develop a best-first heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters, using delayed partial expansion to incrementally explore successors. Provide a completeness-in-the-limit analysis under certain conditions.

Result: The proposed algorithm offers a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art approaches for planning problems with control parameters and establishes a completeness-in-the-limit property under specified conditions.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling control parameters as decision points within a best-first search is a viable and effective approach for planning with numeric control parameters, with theoretical guarantees and practical competitive performance.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

*Minjong Yoo,Jinwoo Jang,Sihyung Yoon,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WorMI implants domain-specific world models into an LLM-powered embodied agent at test time, enabling cross-domain adaptation with minimal retraining; it uses prototype-based model retrieval and a world-wise attention mechanism to fuse knowledge, achieving superior zero-shot and few-shot performance on VirtualHome and ALFWorld.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust, data-efficient adaptation of embodied agents to unseen domains without extensive data collection or retraining, addressing the brittleness of single-model policies.

Method: WorMI integrates independently learned world models with an LLM-based policy via test-time composition. It uses (1) a prototype-based retrieval of relevant world models through trajectory-based abstract representation matching, and (2) a world-wise compound attention mechanism that aligns and fuses intermediate representations from retrieved models with the reasoning model within the policy.

Result: Empirical evaluation on VirtualHome and ALFWorld shows superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based baselines, demonstrating cross-domain adaptability and data efficiency.

Conclusion: WorMI demonstrates scalable, robust cross-domain adaptability for embodied agents by fusing multiple domain-specific world models with a reasoning LLM, with strong potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

### [95] [Meta-Policy Reflexion: Reusable Reflective Memory and Rule Admissibility for Resource-Efficient LLM Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03990)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MPR unifies LLM reflections into a reusable Meta-Policy Memory and uses soft-guided decoding plus hard admissibility checks to improve task performance and safety without weight updates, demonstrated in AlfWorld-style experiments with gains over Reflexion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents currently struggle with repeated failures, ineffecient exploration, and poor cross-task adaptability. Reflections are often ephemeral and task-specific, while RL-based approaches require heavy weight updates. The work aims to create a reusable, safe, weight-free memory that preserves reflection-based adaptability.

Method: Introduce Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) as a predicate-like representation built from LLM-generated reflections. Apply inference-time via two mechanisms: (i) soft memory-guided decoding, and (ii) hard rule admissibility checks (HAC). Formalize MPM, provide update and decoding algorithms, and validate in a text-based AlfWorld-style environment. Compare against Reflexion baselines and analyze scalability and failure modes.

Result: Empirical results show consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness over Reflexion baselines; enabling HAC further improves stability.

Conclusion: MPM externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model weight updates, enforces domain constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and retains the adaptability of language-based reflection. The work discusses scalability, failure modes, and future directions including multimodal and multi-agent extensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and
multi?agent extensions.

*Jinyuan Li,Yi Chu,Yiwen Sun,Mengchuan Zou,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoPBO is an LLM-powered framework that automatically improves pseudo-Boolean (PB) local search solvers, achieving significant gains over existing local search methods and performing competitively with strong PB/MIP solvers across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBO is a powerful way to model combinatorial problems via PB constraints, and local search solvers rely on handcrafted heuristics that require expert tuning. Automating heuristic design with LLMs could reduce manual effort and improve performance, addressing a gap in current solver development.

Method: Introduce AutoPBO, an LLM-powered framework that automatically enhances PBO local search solvers. The evaluation spans four benchmarks (a real-world PB benchmark, a PB competition benchmark, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark) and compares against six baselines: NuPBO, OraSLS (local search PBO solvers); PBO-IHS, RoundingSat (complete PB solvers); Gurobi and SCIP (MIP solvers).

Result: AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over prior local search approaches and maintains competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating the design of local search solvers for PBO, suggesting LLMs can effectively automate heuristic development and yield robust performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Space reframes LLM reasoning as optimization in a continuous semantic space, linking CoT length to underfitting-overfitting trade-offs; the framework explains phenomena like overthinking and is empirically validated, offering a theoretical basis for better reasoning agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: addresses a theoretical gap: token-level RL aligns poorly with reasoning-level, multi-step Chain-of-Thought processes in LLMs; seeks a framework that captures reasoning dynamics beyond token prediction.

Method: proposes CoT-Space, a continuous reasoning-space framework that treats reasoning as an optimization process rather than token prediction; analyzes this process from both noise and risk perspectives and derives convergence properties for the optimal CoT length; supports claims with extensive experiments.

Result: theory aligns with empirical observations, such as overthinking, and demonstrates strong empirical validation across tasks, supporting the proposed trade-off-driven view and the convergence to optimal CoT length.

Conclusion: provides a coherent theoretical foundation for reasoning agent design and guides future improvements toward more generalizable and effective reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

TL;DR: Oruga is an implementation of Representational Systems Theory (RST) featuring core data structures, a communication language, and a structure-transfer engine to enable flexible cross-domain transformations of representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to endow machines with flexible representation manipulation like humans, enabling diagrams, creative analogies across domains, and improved human–machine compatibility.

Method: develop Oruga: a core data-structure suite mapping to RST concepts, a language to interact with the core, and a structure-transfer engine that executes transformations; the paper provides an overview of the core and language and a brief example of a transformation.

Result: the paper presents an overview of the core structures and the interacting language, plus a short example illustrating what a structure-transfer transformation can do, demonstrating feasibility.

Conclusion: Oruga demonstrates a concrete implementation of aspects of RST, offering a path toward flexible, human-aligned representational manipulation in machines and outlining future directions for refining the core components and their interactions.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

### [99] [Intermediate Languages Matter: Formal Languages and LLMs affect Neurosymbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04083)
*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The intermediate formal language choice is a key, previously overlooked, determinant of neurosymbolic LLM reasoning performance; comparing four formal languages across three datasets and seven LLMs shows that language choice affects both syntactic and semantic reasoning and interacts with model type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite progress in LLMs, formal reasoning lags; neurosymbolic reasoning (LLMs translating to a formal language followed by symbolic solving) depends on more than prompts and solvers. The formal language itself may be a critical design factor.

Method: Empirical comparison of four formal languages across three datasets and seven LLMs, assessing syntactic (translation integrity, rule conformance) and semantic (correct outcomes) reasoning; analysis of how language choice interacts with different LLMs.

Result: Formal language choice significantly affects both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. The impact varies across LLMs, with some languages benefiting certain models more than others.

Conclusion: Selecting an appropriate formal language is a critical design knob in neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. The findings motivate systematic evaluation of language choices and suggest future work to map model-language pairs or develop adaptive language selection strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [100] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-guided constrained path planning speeds up flight path optimization with minimal fuel deviation, achieving up to 50% speedup; global optimality not guaranteed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency or time-critical rerouting requires fast computation. Reducing the solver's search space can dramatically speed up route optimization while aiming to maintain fuel efficiency.

Method: Train a reinforcement learning agent to pre-compute near-optimal paths using location and atmospheric data. At runtime, use these paths to constrain the underlying path-planning solver, finding solutions within a fixed distance from the initial guess (i.e., a restricted search space). Evaluate with Airbus performance models.

Result: Fuel consumption remains nearly identical to an unconstrained solver, with deviations typically within 1%. Computation speed can be improved by up to 50% compared to a conventional solver.

Conclusion: The approach accelerates route optimization while preserving near-optimal fuel efficiency; global optimality is not guaranteed, but empirical results show meaningful speedups with minimal impact on fuel use.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

### [101] [Analysis of Bluffing by DQN and CFR in Leduc Hold'em Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04125)
*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Both DQN and CFR bluff in Leduc Hold'em; bluffing rates differ by method, but the success rate of bluffs is similar, implying bluffing is a fundamental aspect of poker rather than tied to a single algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bluffing is central to poker but underexplored in computer-poker; comparing a learning-based agent (DQN) with a game-theoretic agent (CFR) to understand bluffing behavior.

Method: Head-to-head experiments where DQN and CFR agents play against each other; actions are logged to identify bluffing instances and to measure their frequency and success (opponent folding).

Result: Both agents exhibit bluffing; they bluff at different frequencies, but the percentage of successful bluffs is roughly the same across agents.

Conclusion: Bluffing seems to be an essential aspect of poker across algorithms, not an artifact of a particular method; future work should investigate different bluffing styles and the full (multi-round) game of poker.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

### [102] [The human biological advantage over AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04130)
*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI may excel at many tasks, but a biologically grown CNS and DNA-based embodiment provide irreplaceable emotional understanding and ethical grounding; leadership of the universe should remain rooted in biology, not silicon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess what truly differentiates humans from AI and whether a 'digital species' could legitimately lead, by emphasizing embodied experience and emotion as core ethical drivers.

Method: Conceptual/analytical argument comparing the CNS to AI capabilities, arguing that emotional understanding and the non-manufacturability of the CNS are central to ethical leadership.

Result: Emotional understanding of the consequences of actions, encoded via the CNS, is essential for sustainable ethical systems. The CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated. AI may surpass humans in many domains, but DNA-based biology remains the strongest foundation for leadership.

Conclusion: Ultimately, DNA—not silicon—should serve as the foundation for leadership of the universe, since CNS embodiment and embodied ethics cannot be replicated by AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

TL;DR: An extensible DSL for cooking encodes recipes as directed action graphs to capture processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and composition; early manual evaluation shows expressiveness and potential for automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooking procedures are complex and ambiguous; a formal model and ontology are needed to enable precise interpretation and scalable automation in homes and professional kitchens.

Method: Propose a domain-specific language that represents recipes as directed action graphs, modeling processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure; extensible for future analysis and automated execution.

inherent complexity and ambiguity. We introduce an extensible domain-specific
language for representing recipes as directed action graphs, capturing
processes, transfers, environments, concurrency, and compositional structure.
Our approach enables precise, modular modeling of complex culinary workflows.
Initial manual evaluation on a full English breakfast recipe demonstrates the
DSL's expressiveness and suitability for future automated recipe analysis and

ontology for cooking, using temporal graphs to enable structured machine
understanding, precise interpretation, and scalable automation of culinary
processes - both in home kitchens and professional culinary settings.

### [104] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: As domain size grows, MLNs exhibit diverse limiting behaviours depending on the soft constraints; full limit-characterization is possible for a simple 1-ary, quantifier-free case; MLNs that penalize triangles yield a δ-approximate 0-1 law; MLNs that constrain degrees have limit behaviour strongly dependent on constraint weights; quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks are asymptotically incomparable; eventually MLN mass concentrates away from the uniform distribution on large domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Markov Logic Networks behave asymptotically as the domain becomes large, clarifying what kinds of limit distributions arise, how soft constraints influence these limits, and how MLNs relate to other probabilistic-logical formalisms.

Method: Analyze three concrete MLN families under growing domain sizes: (1) quantifier-free MLNs with a single unary relation, (2) MLNs favoring graphs with few triangles (or k-cliques), deriving a δ-approximate 0-1 law, and (3) MLNs favoring graphs with bounded degree, examining how limit behaviour depends on weights. Additionally compare quantifier-free MLNs with lifted Bayesian networks and study concentration of measure vs. uniform distribution.

Result: (1) For the unary, quantifier-free case, the authors provide a pretty complete characterization of possible limiting structures as the domain tends to infinity. (2) For MLNs penalizing triangles, they obtain a δ-approximate 0-1 law for first-order logic. (3) For MLNs penalizing high-degree vertices, the limit behaviour depends on which soft constraints dominate; weights may or may not affect the limit. The paper also shows asymptotic incomparability between quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks, and demonstrates that, on large domains, MLN distributions concentrate on a region of possible worlds very different from the uniform distribution.

Conclusion: MLNs exhibit highly constraint-structured asymptotics: limit behaviour is highly sensitive to the chosen soft constraints, and no single MLN family dominates all others as domain grows. Quantifier-free MLNs and lifted BNs can define non-overlapping asymptotic distributions, and MLN mass concentrates away from uniform, highlighting the need to tailor model choice and parameterization to the target large-domain behaviour.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Motivation: To provide a structured method for evaluating and prioritizing narrative quality aspects in AI-assisted game design, aiming to improve player satisfaction and facilitate co-creation.

Method: A Delphi study with narrative-design experts, synthesizing literature-derived quality dimensions and mapping them into the Kano model to assess their impact on player satisfaction.

Result: A structured methodology that links narrative quality factors to Kano-based satisfaction, enabling developers to prioritize quality aspects in AI-assisted narrative creation.

Conclusion: This approach helps developers allocate resources effectively by focusing on quality dimensions with the greatest impact on player satisfaction in AI-generated game narratives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structured methodology to evaluate AI-generated game

### [106] [EvoEmo: Towards Evolved Emotional Policies for LLM Agents in Multi-Turn Negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04310)
*Yunbo Long,Liming Xu,Lukas Beckenbauer,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo introduces an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework to optimize dynamic emotional expression in multi-turn negotiations by modeling emotional transitions as an MDP and evolving emotion policies via population-based genetics, outperforming vanilla and fixed-emotion baselines in terms of success, efficiency, and buyer savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM negotiation agents rely on passive, fixed emotional responses that are vulnerable to manipulation. There is a need for adaptive, craftable emotional policies to improve performance and resilience in complex negotiations.

Method: Treat emotion states as a Markov Decision Process and apply population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. Build an evaluation framework with two baselines (vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies) and conduct extensive experiments and ablations to assess performance and robustness.

Result: EvoEmo outperforms both baselines across multiple metrics, achieving higher success rates, greater efficiency, and increased buyer savings. Ablation studies indicate the benefits of adaptive emotional expression in negotiation.

Conclusion: Adaptive, policy-driven emotional expression is beneficial for LLM agents in multi-turn negotiations, highlighting the importance of integrating dynamic emotions into agent design to resist manipulation and improve negotiation outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

### [107] [Improving Robustness of AlphaZero Algorithms to Test-Time Environment Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04317)
*Isidoro Tamassia,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A few straightforward tweaks to AlphaZero enable better performance when test-time environments change, even with tight planning budgets; code is available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes a stationary environment, which limits applicability in real-world scenarios where the test distribution may shift. This work seeks to improve robustness and adaptability of AlphaZero under distribution changes with minimal planning resources.

Method: The authors analyze deployment in changed test environments and propose a set of simple modifications to the standard AlphaZero framework, combining them to boost performance under limited planning budgets. They evaluate the approach and make the code publicly available.

Result: The combined simple modifications significantly boost AlphaZero’s performance in changed test environments, even when the planner budget is low.

Conclusion: Simple, easy-to-apply modifications can extend AlphaZero’s applicability to non-stationary environments and improve robustness under limited planning resources; the approach is publicly available for replication on GitHub.

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts is a prompt-based personality-conditioning framework for LLM agents that imprints MBTI-style traits to steer cognition and affect, enabling task-specific biases without fine-tuning and verifiable via 16Personalities, with generalization to other personality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge psychological theory and AI agent behavior design to improve controllability, interpretability, and cooperation in multi-agent settings, without requiring costly model fine-tuning.

Method: Prompt engineering primes LLMs with MBTI archetypes along two cognitive axes (cognition and affect), enables structured multi-agent communication, and includes a pre-interaction self-reflection step. Trait persistence is verified using the 16Personalities test. The approach claims generalization to other frameworks (Big Five, HEXACO, Enneagram) and applies to narrative generation and game-theoretic tasks without fine-tuning.

Result: Personality priming yields consistent and interpretable biases: emotionally expressive agents excel at narrative generation, analytically primed agents adopt more stable game strategies. Self-reflection before interaction improves cooperation and reasoning quality. Trait persistence is verifiable via 16Personalities. The approach generalizes to other psychological frameworks.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents without fine-tuning, bridging psychology and LLM design, and applicable across multiple personality models.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

*Matthew Ho,Chen Si,Zhaoxiang Feng,Fangxu Yu,Zhijian Liu,Zhiting Hu,Lianhui Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes concept-level external memory for LLMs that stores reusable, language-based abstractions from reasoning traces, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates; dynamic memory updates outperform fixed memory; shows 7.5% relative gain on ARC-AGI that scales with compute; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference traces from reasoning are discarded when the context window resets, wasting valuable insights. A memory system that persists and reuses conceptual takeaways can improve performance on reasoning tasks and support test-time continual learning without changing model weights.

Method: Abstracts rollouts into reusable, modular concepts stored in natural language; retrieves relevant concepts for new queries and integrates them into prompts at test time; compares dynamic vs fixed memory, and evaluates on ARC-AGI across varying inference compute; shows benefits increase with more compute.

Result: On ARC-AGI, achieves 7.5% relative improvement over a strong no-memory baseline; concept-level memory consistently outperforms baselines across tested compute scales; dynamic (test-time) memory updates outperform an identically configured fixed memory with extra attempts.

Conclusion: Concept-level, dynamically updated external memory can enable test-time continual learning and self-improvement in LLM reasoning, with performance gains that scale with inference compute and without parameter updates.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

*Quan Quan,Jiwen Xu,Runxiao Liu,Yi Ding,Jiaxing Che,Kai-Yuan Cai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized, physics-inspired swarm control for cooperative aerial transport that uses a dissipative, table-leg-like load-sharing mechanism. It enables autonomous stabilization and adaptive load distribution without explicit communication, with proven stability and robust performance in simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability, communication dependency, and robustness challenges in existing cooperative aerial transport methods, enabling reliable logistics and disaster-response operations with robot swarms.

Method: Develop a decentralized dissipative force model inspired by table-leg load distribution. Robots rely on local neighbor information and the suspended payload to adjust their positions, achieving energy-dissipative stability without explicit inter-robot communication. The approach includes a theoretical stability proof and validation through simulations and outdoor experiments.

Result: Simulation results show tracking errors reduced to 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches under capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and payload variation, respectively. Real-world experiments with six drones achieved a 94% success rate under single-robot failure, disconnections, 25% payload variation, and 40% cable length uncertainty, with robustness to outdoor winds up to Beaufort scale 4.

Conclusion: The physics-inspired dissipative-load approach bridges swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to perform complex transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Abstract: In comparison with existing approaches, which struggle with scalability,
communication dependency, and robustness against dynamic failures, cooperative
aerial transportation via robot swarms holds transformative potential for
logistics and disaster response. Here, we present a physics-inspired
cooperative transportation approach for flying robot swarms that imitates the
dissipative mechanics of table-leg load distribution. By developing a
decentralized dissipative force model, our approach enables autonomous
formation stabilization and adaptive load allocation without the requirement of
explicit communication. Based on local neighbor robots and the suspended
payload, each robot dynamically adjusts its position. This is similar to
energy-dissipating table leg reactions. The stability of the resultant control
system is rigorously proved. Simulations demonstrate that the tracking errors
of the proposed approach are 20%, 68%, 55.5%, and 21.9% of existing approaches
under the cases of capability variation, cable uncertainty, limited vision, and
payload variation, respectively. In real-world experiments with six flying
robots, the cooperative aerial transportation system achieved a 94% success
rate under single-robot failure, disconnection events, 25% payload variation,
and 40% cable length uncertainty, demonstrating strong robustness under outdoor
winds up to Beaufort scale 4. Overall, this physics-inspired approach bridges
swarm intelligence and mechanical stability principles, offering a scalable
framework for heterogeneous aerial systems to collectively handle complex
transportation tasks in communication-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-driven conditional embedding framework for two-robot cooperative grasping that uses dual neural networks to map grasp configurations into an embedding space, enabling identification of feasible grasp configurations across diverse environments and object shapes; validated in simulation and on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable two-robot cooperative grasping in constrained environments with strong generalization across object geometries and scene layouts; address the need for a learnable representation to distinguish feasible vs infeasible grasps.

Method: A conditional embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. Embeddings are used to identify feasible grasp configurations for two-robot transport. Training is supervised with negative sampling on a dataset spanning diverse environment maps and object shapes to promote generalizable discrimination between feasible and infeasible grasps.

Result: In simulations across many environments and objects, the model reliably identifies feasible grasp configurations. Physical robot experiments validate the framework's practical applicability.

Conclusion: The CE framework offers a generalizable, practical approach for cooperative grasping in constrained settings, demonstrated by successful simulation and real-world experiments, with potential applicability to broader multi-robot manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decision-making in cooperative grasping for
two-robot object transport in constrained environments. The core of the
framework is a Conditional Embedding (CE) model consisting of two neural
networks that map grasp configuration information into an embedding space. The
resulting embedding vectors are then used to identify feasible grasp
configurations that allow two robots to collaboratively transport an object. To
ensure generalizability across diverse environments and object geometries, the
neural networks are trained on a dataset comprising a range of environment maps
and object shapes. We employ a supervised learning approach with negative
sampling to ensure that the learned embeddings effectively distinguish between
feasible and infeasible grasp configurations. Evaluation results across a wide
range of environments and objects in simulations demonstrate the model's
ability to reliably identify feasible grasp configurations. We further validate
the framework through experiments on a physical robotic platform, confirming
its practical applicability.

*Antonio Guillen-Perez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient Virtuoso: a conditional latent diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning that uses a two-stage normalization, PCA latent space, and an MLP denoiser guided by a Transformer StateEncoder to achieve state-of-the-art minADE on Waymo Open Motion; highlights that multi-step sparse routes are crucial for high-fidelity tactical execution beyond single-endpoint goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles require diverse, plausible, and controllable future trajectories that balance fidelity, sampling efficiency, and computational cost. Existing generative models often trade off precision, speed, or control granularity, limiting real-time planning and nuanced behavior.

Method: The approach introduces a two-stage normalization: first scale trajectories to preserve geometric aspect ratio, then normalize the resulting PCA latent space to stabilize training targets. Denoising occurs in a low-dimensional latent space via a simple MLP denoiser conditioned on rich scene context. Scene context is fused by a Transformer-based StateEncoder. The model is conditioned on goals for trajectory planning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset with minADE = 0.25. An ablation study on goal representation shows that while a single endpoint can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is essential for precise, high-fidelity tactical execution resembling human driving behavior.

Conclusion: The proposed Efficient Virtuoso delivers efficient, high-fidelity trajectory generation by combining thoughtful normalization, latent-diffusion in a compact latent space, and strong context conditioning. The findings underscore the importance of richer, multi-step goal representations for achieving nuanced tactical driving.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

TL;DR: Real-time buoyancy via convex-hull submerged volume; geometry-driven approach enabling Isaac Sim integration without precomputed hydrodynamics; robust to orientation and modest wave fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, real-time buoyancy is crucial for high-fidelity AUV simulations; NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a native buoyancy system, necessitating external or approximate methods.

Method: Extract the AUV mesh from the simulation, compute the hull portion submerged by intersecting with the water surface along the z-axis; apply a cross-sectional-area extension to reduce computation, updating buoyant forces as orientation, depth, and waves change (±0.3 m).

Result: Demonstrates real-time performance and scalability on a custom AUV for SAUVC 2025, with improved fidelity over geometric approximations and without relying on precomputed hydrodynamics.

Conclusion: A convex-hull submerged-volume approach is a practical, scalable solution for real-time buoyancy in AUV simulations, with potential for broader adoption though further validation across diverse geometries and more extreme wave conditions may be needed.

Abstract: Accurate real-time buoyancy modeling is essential for high-fidelity
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulations, yet NVIDIA Isaac Sim lacks a
native buoyancy system, requiring external solutions for precise underwater
physics. This paper presents a novel convex hull-based approach to dynamically
compute the submerged volume of an AUV in real time. By extracting mesh
geometry from the simulation environment and calculating the hull portion
intersecting the water level along the z-axis, our method enhances accuracy
over traditional geometric approximations. A cross-sectional area extension
reduces computational overhead, enabling efficient buoyant force updates that
adapt to orientation, depth, and sinusoidal wave fluctuations (+-0.3 m). Tested
on a custom AUV design for SAUVC 2025, this approach delivers real-time
performance and scalability, improving simulation fidelity for underwater
robotics research without precomputed hydrodynamic models.

*Guanglu Jia,Ceng Zhang,Gregory S. Chirikjian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: INGRID automates the design of parallel robotic mechanisms by integrating reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis with four design tasks (constraint analysis, joint generation, chain construction, complete design). It can generate novel configurations, including variable mobility, validated by three case studies, and aims to decouple AI progress from hardware constraints by enabling non-specialists to design task-specific parallel robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serial robotic architectures and hardware constraints limit the scope of robotic intelligence; bridging mechanism theory with machine learning enables AI systems to influence hardware design and realize mechanism intelligence, potentially transforming embodied AI.

Method: Decompose design into four tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. Integrate reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis to automatically generate parallel mechanisms with fixed or variable mobility. Validate by three case studies showing design assistance for task-specific robots and the discovery of configurations not previously documented.

Result: INGRID can generate novel parallel mechanisms and discover previously undocumented kinematic configurations, including both fixed and variable mobility. It provides three case studies demonstrating how it helps users design task-specific parallel robots based on mobility requirements, and shows coupling of mechanism theory with machine learning to enable researchers without robotics training to design custom hardware.

Conclusion: This work lays the foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming embodied AI research by decoupling advancements in AI from hardware limitations.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic
Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic
mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,
potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

*Haichao Zhang,Haonan Yu,Le Zhao,Andrew Choi,Qinxun Bai,Yiqing Yang,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sim-to-real trained visuo-motor policy enables a quadruped robot to perform a multi-stage pick-and-place task with ~80% real-world success; emergent behaviors (re-grasping, task chaining) and broad indoor/outdoor deployment demonstrated, with ablation studies clarifying training-transfer techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation is challenging due to skill diversity, long task horizons, and partial observability. A scalable, end-to-end learning approach that transfers from simulation to the real world is needed to achieve robust real-world performance.

Method: Train a visuomotor policy entirely in simulation for a multi-stage pick-and-place task. The policy handles search, approach, grasp, transport, and drop, with emergent behaviors like re-grasping and task chaining. Extensive real-world experiments with ablations identify techniques for efficient training and sim-to-real transfer, and deployment across varied indoor/outdoor environments. Demo resources are provided on the project page.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of end-to-end sim-to-real visuo-motor policies for complex quadruped manipulation, showing robustness and transferability across tasks and environments, and contributing practical insights for efficient training and deployment.

Abstract: Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in
robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon,
and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task
as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for
quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a
visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in
the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp,
transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping
and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with
ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and
effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment

*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm visuotactile system for garment manipulation using confidence-aware dense visual correspondences and tactile-guided grasp affordances, trained in high-fidelity simulation, which defers action under low confidence and demonstrates folding/hanging with reusable dense descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, material dynamics, and occlusion; prior work often flattens garments or assumes visibility of key features.

Method: Two main components: (i) a visual correspondence model trained with a distributional loss on a high-fidelity simulated dataset to produce per-location correspondences and confidence estimates that account for cloth symmetry; (ii) a visuotactile grasp affordance network trained self-supervised on high-resolution tactile data, used for real-time grasp validation. A reactive state machine uses confidence to adapt folding strategies; the tactile classifier is also used during execution; dense descriptors serve as a reusable intermediate representation for other planners, e.g., extracting grasp targets from human demonstrations.

Result: Demonstrates task-agnostic grasp selection in folding and hanging tasks; handles highly occluded and in-air garment configurations; shows that the dense descriptors can support other planning modalities.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust, generalizable garment manipulation by integrating perception and tactile sensing, with a reusable dense descriptor as a versatile planning primitive and a perception-driven, uncertainty-aware execution strategy.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

*Branimir Ćaran,Vladimir Milić,Marko Švaco,Bojan Jerbić*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multimodal EKF/UKF pose estimator for a wall-climbing 4WIS4WID robot using wheel odometry, visual odometry, and IMU, with comprehensive parameter calibration, validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In wall-climbing environments traditional localization sensors are infeasible due to facade geometry and electromagnetic interference; GPS is unreliable, and odometry drifts, necessitating robust fusion-based pose estimation.

Method: Fusion of wheel odometry, visual odometry, and IMU using EKF and UKF. Parameter calibration via nonlinear optimization (Levenberg–Marquardt/Newton–Gauss and gradient-based methods) and stochastic methods (Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm). Experimental validation on a wall-climbing robot.

Result: Calibration methods and the proposed pose estimators were validated in detail through experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot, demonstrating feasibility and improved pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion approach provides a viable, experimentally validated solution for accurate pose estimation in wall-climbing robots, compensating for odometry drift when traditional sensors are unavailable.

Abstract: This paper presents the design of a pose estimator for a four wheel
independent steer four wheel independent drive (4WIS4WID) wall climbing mobile
robot, based on the fusion of multimodal measurements, including wheel
odometry, visual odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The pose
estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their
operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and
maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the
building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material
properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors
such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing
robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these
environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and
electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary
source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift
caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the
robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and
Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting
methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as
stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and
results of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail
with experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.

*Yifan Yang,Zhixiang Duan,Tianshi Xie,Fuyu Cao,Pinxi Shen,Peili Song,Piaopiao Jin,Guokang Sun,Shaoqing Xu,Yangwei You,Jingtai Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-model FPC-VLA blends Vision-Language-Action with a failure-predicting supervisor to improve robustness and generalization in robotic manipulation. It uses concise keyframe supervision and a similarity-guided fusion module trained without manual labels, achieving superior performance in simulation and real-robot experiments with minimal runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional planning pipelines struggle with open-ended tasks, and single end-to-end VLA systems lack mechanisms to anticipate and recover from failures. There is a need for a framework that can predict action viability and propose corrective strategies to enhance reliability in long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Method: Integrate VLA with a supervisor that assesses action viability via vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks are detected. The supervisor is trained efficiently without manual labeling. A similarity-guided fusion module refines actions by leveraging past predictions. The supervisor is activated only at keyframes to reduce overhead. Demonstrated across multiple simulators (SIMPLER, LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka).

Result: FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. It increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm strong generalization and practical utility for reliable autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The proposed FPC-VLA offers a robust, generalizable framework that combines proactive failure prediction and correction with learning-driven action refinement, enabling more reliable autonomous manipulation across varied platforms and tasks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However,
traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks
due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial
mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these
challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with
a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates
action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective
strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A
similarity-guided fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past
predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and
LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
By activating the supervisor only at keyframes, our approach significantly
increases task success rates with minimal impact on execution time. Successful
real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong
generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous
systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Publish-subscribe data transmission for integrated wheel sensors on ESP32; achieves low data loss (~0.1%) and reduced transmission volume across 1 Hz–32 kHz sampling, enabling real-time insights into tire–road interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current onboard state estimation lacks direct insight into tire–road interactions; need efficient, high-volume, reliable data transmission from wheel sensors to support real-time analytics and improved interpretation of tire dynamics.

Method: Implemented a publish-subscribe communication architecture on an ESP32 with prototype wheel sensors; evaluated on a drum tire test rig using sample frequencies 1 Hz to 32 kHz; measured transmission volume and data loss.

Result: The system achieved minimal data loss (~0.1% of samples) and outperformed comparable literature solutions in data transmission volume, demonstrating reliable, efficient real-time data acquisition.

Conclusion: The approach advances real-time wheel sensor data acquisition and communication, enabling better analysis of tire–road interaction and offering a path toward optimized integrated wheel sensor networks.

Abstract: While current onboard state estimation methods are adequate for most driving

interaction between tires and road surfaces. This paper explores a novel
communication concept for efficiently transmitting integrated wheel sensor data
from an ESP32 microcontroller. Our proposed approach utilizes a
publish-subscribe system, surpassing comparable solutions in the literature
regarding data transmission volume. We tested this approach on a drum tire test
rig with our prototype sensors system utilizing a diverse selection of sample
frequencies between 1 Hz and 32 000 Hz to demonstrate the efficacy of our
communication concept. The implemented prototype sensor showcases minimal data
loss, approximately 0.1 % of the sampled data, validating the reliability of
our developed communication system. This work contributes to advancing
real-time data acquisition, providing insights into optimizing integrated wheel

### [121] [Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063)
*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an offline RL post-training objective for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) flow models and an adaptive fine-tuning algorithm (ARFM) that uses a dynamically scaled loss to balance RL signals with flow loss variance. Demonstrates improved action accuracy, generalization, and sample efficiency on complex tasks through simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivates addressing the limitation that VLA flow models rely on imitation learning, which poorly exploits data quality distributions that RL can leverage. Offline RL can better understand data distribution and improve action precision in complex tasks.

Method: Theoretically formulate an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and introduce Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM), an offline RL fine-tuning algorithm that adaptively scales the RL signal in the flow-model loss. This creates a bias-variance trade-off to preserve RL advantages while controlling gradient variance, enabling stable, efficient fine-tuning.

Result: ARFM demonstrates strong generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning in both simulations and real-world experiments, outperforming baseline post-training approaches.

Conclusion: ARFM provides a principled, stable offline RL fine-tuning framework for VLA flow models, achieving improved action accuracy on complex tasks by balancing RL benefits with flow-gradient stability, and showing strong generalization and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

### [122] [Solving Robotics Tasks with Prior Demonstration via Exploration-Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04069)
*Chengyandan Shen,Christoffer Sloth*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRLR introduces an exploration-efficient reinforcement learning framework for robotics by embedding a calibrated Q-value action selector within IBRL and replacing TD3 with SAC, achieving robust sim-to-real performance across tasks with varying complexity and demonstration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bootstrapping errors and inefficient exploration in imitation-bootstrapped RL hinder sample efficiency and policy quality in robotics, especially under varying demonstration quality and high-dimensional state-action spaces. A calibrated Q-value approach combined with a stable policy (SAC) can improve exploration and generalization.

Method: The action selection module is enhanced to produce calibrated Q-values to mitigate bootstrapping error. SAC replaces TD3 as the RL policy within the IBRL-based DRLR framework. The framework is evaluated on two robotics tasks (bucket loading and open drawer) in simulation, with varying state-action dimensions and demonstration quality, and is deployed to a real wheel loader for bucket loading to validate sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Calibrated Q-values reduce bootstrapping error and overfitting, enabling more efficient exploration. The DRLR framework demonstrates robustness across tasks with different dimensionality and demonstration quality and achieves successful sim-to-real deployment on a wheel loader.

Conclusion: DRLR with calibrated Q-value action selection and SAC-based policy offers improved exploration efficiency, robustness to demonstration quality, and practical real-world applicability in robotic tasks, evidenced by both simulation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

*Lennart Clasmeier,Jan-Gerrit Habekost,Connor Gäde,Philipp Allgeuer,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning achieves faster runtimes and competitive success rates; dataset biases and ablation on point-cloud conditioning improve results; non-conditioning version still outperforms traditional planners by an order of magnitude, with up to 90% collision-free success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the runtime bottlenecks of classical numerical planners in motion planning by leveraging data-driven diffusion models trained on planner-generated datasets, including conditioning on point-cloud representations.

Method: Introduce a diffusion-based action model that predicts keypoint-based joint sequences from inputs including point-cloud embeddings; train on datasets generated by numerical planners; conduct ablation study on point-cloud conditioning; refine dataset biases to improve conditioning.

Result: Runtime dramatically reduced (order of magnitude faster) than numerical models; collision-free success up to ~90% on test set; model performs well even without point-cloud conditioning.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based action models can substantially accelerate robotic motion planning with competitive success; challenges in conditioning on point-cloud data can be mitigated by dataset refinement; potential for practical deployment given strong speedups and high success rate.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

*Fatih Dursun,Bruno Vilhena Adorno,Simon Watson,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A fast, focus-point-based view path planning approach for object reconstruction that maintains a point of interest in view along the path and integrates with mobile manipulator control; achieves ~9x time speedup with comparable coverage and entropy to a sampling-based baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient view planning for object reconstruction is hindered by costly sampling-based methods that evaluate many candidate views; a real-time capable solution is needed that preserves information gain.

Method: Compute a focus point in the most informative (unknown) region and keep the camera pointed at it along the trajectory; integrate this visibility constraint into the whole-body control of an 8-DoF mobile manipulator, without an additional path planner; evaluate on a large simulated dataset of 114 objects across 57 categories and on real-world experiments; compare to a sampling-based baseline evaluated via Bayesian data analysis.

Result: No significant difference in object coverage and entropy between the proposed method and the baseline; however, the proposed method is about nine times faster on average in terms of the time the robot spends between views.

Conclusion: The focus-point, visibility-constrained approach delivers comparable reconstruction performance to sampling-based planning while substantially reducing computational time, enabling faster view-path planning for object reconstruction on mobile manipulators.

Abstract: Object reconstruction and inspection tasks play a crucial role in various
robotics applications. Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of
the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects
efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.
Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating
potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,
these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several
candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally
efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most
informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the
camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the
whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint
without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and
realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying
sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning
strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world
experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed
method's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no
significant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method
is approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in
terms of the average time the robot spends between views.

TL;DR: A scalable, containerized framework to test cloud/edge robotics using a bidirectional UDP tunnel between a containerized cloud cluster and a robot-simulation environment, with Linux traffic control to emulate latency and jitter for cloud-assisted aerial-robot remote control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud robotics promises computation offloading, data sharing, and coordinated control, but evaluating performance under realistic network conditions remains challenging; a dedicated testing framework is needed to study cloud-edge robotic interactions.

Method: Two containerized components are used: (a) a containerized cloud cluster and (b) a containerized robot simulation environment, connected via a bidirectional UDP tunnel. Realistic network conditions are simulated using Linux traffic control (e.g., tc/netem) to inject delay and jitter. The application scenario focuses on cloud-assisted remote control of aerial robots.

Result: The paper proposes a scalable and intuitive testing framework; the abstract does not report empirical results but outlines the system design and integration.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical tool to evaluate cloud-edge robotics deployments under varying network conditions, supporting development and assessment of cloud-enabled robotic systems.

Abstract: Cloud robotics has emerged as a promising technology for robotics
applications due to its advantages of offloading computationally intensive
tasks, facilitating data sharing, and enhancing robot coordination. However,
integrating cloud computing with robotics remains a complex challenge due to
network latency, security concerns, and the need for efficient resource
management. In this work, we present a scalable and intuitive framework for
testing cloud and edge robotic systems. The framework consists of two main
components enabled by containerized technology: (a) a containerized cloud
cluster and (b) the containerized robot simulation environment. The system
incorporates two endpoints of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) tunnel, enabling
bidirectional communication between the cloud cluster container and the robot
simulation environment, while simulating realistic network conditions. To
achieve this, we consider the use case of cloud-assisted remote control for
aerial robots, while utilizing Linux-based traffic control to introduce
artificial delay and jitter, replicating variable network conditions
encountered in practical cloud-robot deployments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces LASEM, a lightweight actuation-space energy model for cable-driven continuum robots that yields an analytical forward model and efficient inverse kinematics, unifying kinematic and static formulations while avoiding explicit cable-contact modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum robots offer high dexterity and intrinsic compliance but are challenging to model due to their continuously deformable morphology. There is a need for accurate yet lightweight models suitable for real-time planning and control.

Method: Formulate actuation potential energy directly in actuation space. Derive an analytical forward model from geometrically nonlinear beam/rod theories using Hamilton's principle, without explicit cable-backbone contact modeling. Accommodates both force and displacement inputs, unifying kinematic and static formulations. Under frictionless assumption, generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings, distributed loading, and axial extensibility. Provides a semi-analytical iterative scheme for inverse kinematics. For discretized robots, reformulates the problem as numerical optimization, naturally incorporating cable potential energy.

Result: Numerical simulations validate the model’s accuracy. The forward model is analytical and the inverse kinematics can be solved with a semi-analytical iterative scheme. Discretization is handled via numerical optimization, which also includes cable energy without explicit contact modeling.

Conclusion: LASEM delivers a computationally efficient, unified framework for the kinematic and static analysis of cable-driven continuum robots, enabling real-time control and planning by avoiding explicit cable-backbone contact modeling and accommodating a range of geometries and loading conditions.

Abstract: Continuum robots, inspired by octopus arms and elephant trunks, combine
dexterity with intrinsic compliance, making them well suited for unstructured
and confined environments. Yet their continuously deformable morphology poses
challenges for motion planning and control, calling for accurate but
lightweight models. We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling
(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation
potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical
forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via
Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone
contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying
kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the
framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,
distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally
efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a
semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To
address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the
functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally
incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.

TL;DR: OVGrasp introduces a multimodal, open-vocabulary grasping framework for soft exoskeletons, achieving 87% GAS across 15 objects in 3 grasp types with 10 participants; it fuses RGB-D vision, language prompts, and voice commands via a vision-language foundation model and a multimodal decision-maker, enabling zero-shot detection and improved kinematic alignment; promising for generalizable grasp assistance but real-world variability and long-term validation remain areas for exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restore autonomy for individuals with motor impairments in unstructured environments where object categories and user intents are diverse and unpredictable; current systems struggle with unseen objects and flexible human intent; open-vocabulary and multimodal interfaces can enhance generalization and user control.

Method: Hierarchical control framework OVGrasp for soft exoskeleton grasp assistance. It integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice commands. Uses a vision-language foundation model with open-vocabulary mechanism for zero-shot object detection. A multimodal decision-maker fuses spatial and linguistic cues to infer user intent (grasp vs release) in multi-object scenarios. Deployed on a custom egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton. Evaluated across 15 objects, 3 grasp types, with 10 participants.

Result: GAS of 87.00%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and showing improved kinematic alignment with natural hand motion.

Conclusion: Demonstrates robust, generalizable grasp assistance in open environments through multimodal fusion and open-vocabulary perception. Useful for daily living activities but further validation is needed in more diverse real-world conditions and long-term use.

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with
motor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object
categories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present
OVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp
assistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice
commands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in
open environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with
an open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen
objects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial
and linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in
multi-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom
egocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15
objects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants
demonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic
alignment with natural hand motion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Perioperation via DEXOP: a passive hand exoskeleton that mirrors and provides proprioceptive feedback to collect high-quality, transferable dexterous manipulation data at scale, yielding faster, better-performing policies than teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable, transferable human demonstrations for dexterous manipulation in natural environments. Teleoperation often yields less natural data and poorer transfer to real robots, so a data collection paradigm that enhances realism and transferability is valuable.

Method: Introduce and implement DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton that mechanically couples human fingers to robot fingers, provides proprioceptive feedback, and mirrors hand pose to the robot. This perioperation paradigm enables natural demonstrations with rich vision and tactile data. The approach is evaluated on diverse, contact-rich tasks and compared against teleoperation for data efficiency and policy learning.

Result: DEXOP enables high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned from DEXOP data show significantly better task performance per unit time of data collection than those learned from teleoperation, and demonstrations are more natural and accurate, generalizing across dexterous tasks.

Conclusion: DEXOP demonstrates the effectiveness of perioperation for scalable, transferable robotic dexterity data collection, making naturalistic human demonstrations more efficient and transferable to real robots. Project page: https://dex-op.github.io.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EMMA enables scalable end-to-end mobile manipulation learning by fusing human full-body motion data with static robot data, matching teleoperation-based baselines and improving with more human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulation learning is bottlenecked by the need for teleoperation data; leveraging human motion and static robot data can scale data collection and learning in real-world settings.

Method: Train end-to-end policies by co-training human full-body motion data with static robot data, eliminating the need for mobile teleoperation; evaluate on three real-world tasks and compare to Mobile ALOHA; test generalization to new configurations and scenes; analyze data scaling with hours of human data.

Result: EMMA achieves comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data, with equal or higher task success; it generalizes to new spatial configurations and scenes and shows positive performance scaling as more human data are used.

Conclusion: Reducing reliance on teleoperation, EMMA enables scalable learning for mobile manipulation in real-world environments, with strong generalization and data-efficiency potential; further work could expand tasks and data diversity.

Abstract: Scaling mobile manipulation imitation learning is bottlenecked by expensive
mobile robot teleoperation. We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA),
an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile
manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To
accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot
data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates
comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data
(Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task
success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations
and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the
hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in
real-world environments. Details of this project can be found at

*Joseph Rich,Conrad Oakes,Lior Pachter*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Formulates two optimization problems for ordering and coloring partitions in alluvial plots; adapts NeighborNet from phylogenetics to solve them, delivering strong results in typical use cases; implemented as an open-source R package (wompwomp) on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alluvial plots effectively visualize multivariate data but rely on the nontrivial ordering of alluvia; improving ordering and coloring can greatly enhance interpretability.

Method: Define two optimization problems for arranging and coloring partitions in alluvial plots; adapt the NeighborNet phylogenetic network algorithm to solve these problems in typical use cases; provide an open-source implementation in R (GitHub: pachterlab/wompwomp).

Result: The adapted NeighborNet approach yields excellent results in typical use cases for alluvial plot ordering and coloring; the authors provide a freely available R package on GitHub for practical use.

Conclusion: Adapting NeighborNet offers a practical, effective solution for optimizing alluvial plot layouts, with an accessible open-source implementation.

Abstract: Alluvial plots can be effective for visualization of multivariate data, but
rely on ordering of alluvia that can be non-trivial to arrange. We formulate
two optimization problems that formalize the challenge of ordering and coloring
partitions in alluvial plots. While solving these optimization problems is
challenging in general, we show that the NeighborNet algorithm from
phylogenetics can be adapted to provide excellent results in typical use cases.

### [131] [Drawing Trees and Cacti with Integer Edge Lengths on a Polynomial-Size Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04168)
*Henry Förster,Stephen Kobourov,Jacob Miller,Johannes Zink*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Provides polynomial-time, constructive drawings for trees and cactus graphs with integer edge lengths on polynomial-size grids, advancing Kleber's conjecture for these graph classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kleber's conjecture (a strengthened Harborth conjecture) asks for planar straight-line drawings of planar graphs with all edges of integer length and vertices on the integer grid. Most existing results are existential and do not bound grid size. This work seeks constructive, efficiently computable embeddings with explicit grid bounds for specific graph families.

Method: Develops polynomial-time algorithms to embed trees and cactus graphs into the plane as crossing-free straight-line drawings, assigning integer coordinates to vertices and integer lengths to edges, while ensuring all positions fit on a polynomial-size integer grid.

Result: Algorithmic construction of crossing-free straight-line drawings on polynomial-size grids for trees and cactus graphs with integer edge lengths and integer vertex coordinates, achieved in polynomial time.

Conclusion: Extends constructive support for Kleber's conjecture to trees and cactus graphs, providing practical grid-size bounds and opening avenues to extend similar techniques to broader graph classes.

Abstract: A strengthened version of Harborth's well-known conjecture -- known as
Kleber's conjecture -- states that every planar graph admits a planar
straight-line drawing where every edge has integer length and each vertex is
restricted to the integer grid. Positive results for Kleber's conjecture are
known for planar 3-regular graphs, for planar graphs that have maximum degree
4, and for planar 3-trees. However, all but one of the existing results are
existential and do not provide bounds on the required grid size. In this paper,
we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing crossing-free straight-line
drawings of trees and cactus graphs with integer edge lengths and integer
vertex position on polynomial-size integer grids.

### [132] [Bounding a Polygon by a Minimum Number of Vertices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04211)
*Mikkel Abrahamsen,Jack Stade,Shuyi Yan,Hanwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Analyzes how many polygon vertices must be known to bound a polygon; shows upper and lower bounds: 4 log2 n + O(1) sufficiency and log3 n - o(log n) necessity, thus up to a constant factor; connects to certificate complexity for geometric problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the information-theoretic minimum certificate size needed to bound or contain a given polygon, with implications for containment/packing problems and algorithmic running times.

Method: Provide constructive upper bound by exhibiting a bounded region defined by O(log n) vertices. Prove lower bound via adversarial polygon constructions showing any bounding region certificate must specify at least log_3 n - o(log n) vertices. Compare base of logs and discuss constant-factor gap.

Result: Tight up to a constant factor bounds: 4 log2 n + O(1) vertices suffice to bound any n-vertex polygon; any n-vertex polygon requires at least log_3 n - o(log n) vertices in the certificate; thus the optimal certificate length is Theta(log n).

Conclusion: The problem of finding a bound for a polygon can be solved with a certificate whose size is Theta(log n); this informs the best-case running time and shows the bounds for containment/packing problems are determined by this certificate size.

Abstract: Suppose that a polygon $P$ is given as an array containing the vertices in
counterclockwise order. We analyze how many vertices (including the index of
each of these vertices) we need to know before we can bound $P$, i.e., report a
bounded region $R$ in the plane such that $P\subset R$. We show that there
exists polygons where $4\log_2 n+O(1)$ vertices are enough, while
$\log_3n-o(\log n)$ must always be known. We thus answer the question up to a
constant factor. This can be seen as an analysis of the shortest possible
certificate or the best-case running time of any algorithm solving a variety of
problems involving polygons, where a bound must be known in order to answer
correctly. This includes various packing problems such as deciding whether a
polygon can be contained inside another polygon.

### [133] [The Optimiser Hidden in Plain Sight: Training with the Loss Landscape's Induced Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03594)
*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: New class of Riemannian metric–based optimisers for neural networks; adapts learning rate via curvature and supports decoupled weight decay; competitive with Adam with potential gains and similar computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage the intrinsic geometry of the loss landscape by embedding the loss in a higher-dimensional space to derive optimization preconditioners that stabilize training and automatically modulate learning rates.

Method: Introduce a family of optimisers based on the induced Riemannian metric; compatible with existing preconditioning methods; yields automatic learning-rate adaptation in high-curvature regions (smoothing/clip-like behavior); one variant enforces a scheduled learning rate; decoupled weight decay emerges naturally from the geometric formulation; computational cost similar to Adam.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows strong performance in low-dimensional examples and modest improvements over state-of-the-art methods for standard neural network training; the optimisers have desirable theoretical properties and can modify existing preconditioning approaches with comparable complexity to Adam.

Conclusion: Proposes a geometry-grounded optimisation framework that offers principled learning-rate behavior and natural weight decay, with competitive practical performance and broad compatibility with existing optimisers.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

*Chao Pang,Jiheum Park,Xinzhuo Jiang,Nishanth Parameshwar Pavinkurve,Krishna S. Kalluri,Shalmali Joshi,Noémie Elhadad,Karthik Natarajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT is a general-purpose EHR foundation model that unifies feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation using a time-token-based learning framework, enabling cross-task performance and external generalization without task-specific retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs contain rich, longitudinal patient data but most AI models are narrow and task-specific; there is a need for a versatile foundation model that can handle multiple goals (representation, prediction, data generation) while reasoning over temporal sequences.

Method: A single architecture (CEHR-GPT) integrates three capabilities—feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation—implemented via a novel time-token-based learning framework that encodes patients' dynamic timelines. The model supports vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning to generalize to external datasets across tasks.

Result: CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks (representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation) and generalizes to external datasets, enabling rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without task-specific retraining.

Conclusion: The approach offers a versatile, scalable foundation model for EHRs that reduces the need for task-specific retraining, facilitating broader deployment and use in clinical decision support and research.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

### [135] [Nonnegative matrix factorization and the principle of the common cause](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03652)
*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCC and NMF are linked: PCC informs robust estimation of NMF's rank and stabilizes features, while NMF provides an approximate PCC framework for clustering and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore reciprocal links between the Principle of the Common Cause (PCC) in probabilistic causality and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for gray-scale images, aiming for robust rank estimation and improved identifiability.

Method: Map grayscale images to probability models, apply PCC as a predictive tool to determine an effective NMF rank; perform NMF around this rank to obtain stable basis images; develop an approximate PCC-based NMF to cluster data by common causes; demonstrate denoising capabilities on image data.

Result: Robust rank estimation of NMF stable under weak noise; basis images and optimization seeds are stable, addressing nonidentifiability; a clustering method groups points by shared common causes; NMF demonstrates denoising capabilities.

Conclusion: A reciprocal relationship between PCC and NMF is fruitful: PCC can guide robust rank selection and feature stability in NMF, while NMF can implement PCC approximately to enable clustering and denoising on image data.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDeCAB is a semi-decentralized client selection method for federated learning over time-series data in IoT. It uses probabilistic client rankings and, when clients go offline, borrows partial models from nearest neighbors to continue optimization, reducing communication and handling dynamic availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity, energy constraints, and intermittent client availability in IoT-oriented federated learning, with a focus on how availability affects learning with time-series data.

Method: Proposes FedDeCAB, a semi-decentralized client selection framework that ranks available clients probabilistically. When a client disconnects, it fetches partial model parameters from nearest-neighbor clients to continue joint optimization, aiming to reduce communication overhead and improve offline model performance.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness under highly heterogeneous data distributions, tight communication budgets, and dynamic client offline/rejoining using real-world taxi and vessel trajectory datasets; shows improved offline model performance and reduced communication load.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB provides a robust approach for availability-aware FL in IoT with time-series data, balancing convergence and client contributions through probabilistic selection and neighbor-assisted partial updates during offline periods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

### [138] [SharedRep-RLHF: A Shared Representation Approach to RLHF with Diverse Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03672)
*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF is a new RLHF framework that learns and uses shared annotation traits across demographic groups, addressing fairness limitations of uniform RLHF and the minority-group weakness of MaxMin-RLHF. It provides theoretical results showing MaxMin-RLHF is suboptimal for learning shared traits and gives a sample-complexity characterization for SharedRep-RLHF, with empirical NLP gains up to 20% in win rate over MaxMin-RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform reward models in RLHF fail to capture diverse annotator opinions across sub-populations, risking bias toward dominant groups. MaxMin-RLHF mitigates this via group-specific rewards and a min-reward objective, but can underperform when the minimum-reward group is a minority. There is a need to exploit shared traits across groups to improve fairness and learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce SharedRep-RLHF, which learns and leverages shared traits in annotations across groups rather than learning separate reward models per group. The paper also proves that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal for learning shared traits and derives the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Empirical evaluation on diverse NLP tasks assesses performance against MaxMin-RLHF.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved performance over MaxMin-RLHF, with up to 20% gains in win rate across NLP tasks. Theoretical results include suboptimality of MaxMin-RLHF for shared-trait learning and a quantified sample complexity for SharedRep-RLHF.

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF effectively captures shared annotation traits across groups, improving fairness and performance while addressing minority-group limitations. The combination of theoretical guarantees and empirical gains supports its potential for fairer RLHF in diverse applications.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

TL;DR: A data-driven, three-dimensional (cost-efficiency-risk) SCM–FSCM framework integrating Transaction Cost and Information Asymmetry theories with ML (RF, LSTM, XGBoost) and RL to improve inventory turnover, financing costs, and risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address efficiency loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission in supply chains by combining economic theory with machine learning and reinforcement learning to enable rapid monetization of inventory and high-quality supply chain development.

Method: Theoretically integrate Transaction Cost and Information Asymmetry theories with data-driven ML. Build a 3D analysis framework (cost-efficiency-risk) using random forests. Implement an FSCM model of 'core enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing'. Use LSTM for demand forecasting; clustering/regression for benefit allocation.

Result: Inventory turnover up 30%; SME financing costs reduced by 18–22%; order fulfillment rate stable above 95%; demand forecast error ≤ 8%; credit assessment accuracy ≥ 90%.

Conclusion: The SCM–FSCM model reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints, and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

TL;DR: Hyperparameter-free gradient normalization that aligns gradient scaling with its natural variance evolution, stabilizing optimization and preserving convergence; yields maintained or improved CIFAR-100 performance on CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient dynamics are central to stability and generalization in deep nets. Empirical evidence shows gradient variance evolves consistently across layers, motivating a normalization method that adapts to this evolution without hand-tuned hyperparameters and helps bridge theory with practice.

Method: A gradient normalization technique that adjusts the scale of gradients to match their observed variance evolution during training, implemented without extra hyperparameters, aiming to prevent amplification and stabilize optimization while preserving convergence guarantees.

Result: Empirical results on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN show the method maintains or improves test accuracy, even under strong generalization, and stabilizes optimization.

Conclusion: Tracking gradient dynamics directly is valuable for aligning theory with empirical behavior and offers actionable insights for future optimization research.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide

*Zhengyang Li,Qijin Ji,Xinghong Ling,Quan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive MARL survey for video games, outlining genres, challenges, and future directions, plus a proposed complexity estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize rapid MARL progress in game AI, map applications across genres, identify bottlenecks (nonstationarity, partial observability, sparse rewards, coordination, scalability), and guide future research and game development.

Method: Systematic literature review and taxonomy of genres (turn-based two-player, real-time games; sports, FPS, RTS, MOBA); analysis of challenges; mapping of successful implementations; proposal of a game complexity estimation method; discussion of future directions.

Result: A synthesized framework and insights into MARL in video games, with a proposed complexity estimator and identification of key challenges and opportunities; potential benchmarks and research directions.

Conclusion: MARL in video games is advancing across genres, but faces nonstationarity, partial observability, and coordination challenges; a unified evaluation framework and complexity estimator can drive progress and better game AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have
demonstrated its application potential in modern games. Beginning with
foundational work and progressing to landmark achievements such as AlphaStar in
StarCraft II and OpenAI Five in Dota 2, MARL has proven capable of achieving
superhuman performance across diverse game environments through techniques like
self-play, supervised learning, and deep reinforcement learning. With its
growing impact, a comprehensive review has become increasingly important in
this field. This paper aims to provide a thorough examination of MARL's
application from turn-based two-agent games to real-time multi-agent video
games including popular genres such as Sports games, First-Person Shooter (FPS)
games, Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena
(MOBA) games. We further analyze critical challenges posed by MARL in video
games, including nonstationary, partial observability, sparse rewards, team
coordination, and scalability, and highlight successful implementations in
games like Rocket League, Minecraft, Quake III Arena, StarCraft II, Dota 2,
Honor of Kings, etc. This paper offers insights into MARL in video game AI
systems, proposes a novel method to estimate game complexity, and suggests
future research directions to advance MARL and its applications in game
development, inspiring further innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

### [142] [Graph Random Features for Scalable Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03691)
*Matthew Zhang,Jihao Andreas Lin,Adrian Weller,Richard E. Turner,Isaac Reid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRFs enable scalable Bayesian GP inference on graphs by reducing kernel computations from O(N^3) to O(N^{3/2}), enabling Bayesian optimization on graphs with >10^6 nodes on a single chip, with speedups and memory savings while retaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale Gaussian process models to graph inputs (discrete spaces) for Bayesian optimization, overcoming cubic-time kernel computations that limit graph size.

Method: Adopt graph random features (GRFs), a stochastic estimator of graph node kernels, to approximate GP kernels in inference, achieving reduced time and memory complexity.

Result: Under mild assumptions, Bayesian inference with GRFs runs in O(N^{3/2}) time vs O(N^3) for exact kernels; provides wall-clock speedups and memory savings; enables Bayesian optimization on graphs with >10^6 nodes on single hardware, maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: GRFs offer a scalable, hardware-efficient path for GP inference on graphs, enabling large-scale Bayesian optimization without sacrificing much accuracy.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently
introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian
processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs
with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive
performance.

### [143] [Hierarchical Federated Foundation Models over Wireless Networks for Multi-Modal Multi-Task Intelligence: Integration of Edge Learning with D2D/P2P-Enabled Fog Learning Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03695)
*Payam Abdisarabshali,Fardis Nadimi,Kasra Borazjani,Naji Khosravan,Minghui Liwang,Wei Ni,Dusit Niyato,Michael Langberg,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs) for multi-modal multi-task FMs in fog/edge networks, detailing an architecture that aligns M3T FM components with network hierarchy, supports optional device-to-device cooperation, and provides a prototype and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address heterogeneity in data modalities and tasks across geo-distributed fog/edge nodes and to enable scalable, distributed training of complex M3T foundation models that can operate across diverse devices.

Method: Design of HF-FMs that maps modality encoders, prompts, MoEs, adapters, and task heads onto the hierarchical fog/edge infrastructure. Incorporates optional D2D communications for horizontal module relaying and collaborative training. Provides a wireless-network prototype and releases open-source code (GitHub).

Result: A conceptual architectural framework for HF-FMs, with a prototype in a wireless network setting and an open-source implementation to enable further exploration and experimentation in HF-FMs.

Conclusion: HF-FMs introduce new capabilities for handling modality and task heterogeneity in decentralized FMs, offering a promising research direction and practical avenues (prototype and code) to accelerate development in this untapped area.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

### [144] [EmbedOR: Provable Cluster-Preserving Visualizations with Curvature-Based Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03703)
*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR is a curvature-enhanced SNE that improves geometry preservation and clustering in high-dimensional data, extending tSNE consistency to broader datasets and enabling fragmentation analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SNE variants (SNE, tSNE, UMAP) can distort data geometry, spuriously separate connected components, and miss clusters in noisy/high-dimensional data. A curvature-informed distance aims to preserve the underlying manifold structure.

Method: Introduce EmbedOR with a discrete graph curvature–based distance metric; stochastic embedding procedure; theoretical extension of tSNE consistency to a broader class of datasets; extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.

Result: EmbedOR reduces fragmentation of high-density regions, preserves cluster structure better than tSNE/UMAP, and provides a distance metric to annotate visualizations for fragmentation analysis.

Conclusion: EmbedOR offers geometry-preserving visualizations, extends theoretical consistency guarantees, and provides a practical tool for interpreting data geometry and fragmentation.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

### [145] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online Testing Problem (OTP): learning optimal sequential testing policies when test outcomes are missing; a minimax lower bound of Omega(T^{2/3}) on regret is shown, matching an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm with tilde-O(T^{2/3}) regret; a variant with independent rewards (Online Cost-sensitive Maximum Entropy Sampling) admits an iterative-elimination algorithm with tilde-O(sqrt(T)) regret; experiments corroborate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how to optimally select a subset of costly, potentially correlated tests for each subject when the joint distribution of test outcomes is unknown and data may be missing, which biases learning and makes the problem harder than standard episodic MDPs.

Method: The authors formulate OTP and analyze its learning dynamics under missing data. They establish a minimax regret lower bound of Omega(T^{2/3}) for OTP. They propose an Explore-Then-Commit strategy achieving tilde-O(T^{2/3}) regret for both discrete and Gaussian outcome distributions. They study a variant with rewards independent of missing data—the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum Entropy Sampling Problem—and develop an iterative-elimination algorithm achieving tilde-O(sqrt(T)) regret. They complement theory with numerical experiments.

Result: Lower bound: minimax regret scales as Omega(T^{2/3}) for OTP. Algorithmic upper bound: Explore-Then-Commit achieves tilde-O(T^{2/3}) regret for OTP across discrete and Gaussian distributions. Variant with missing-data-independent rewards enables iterative-elimination with tilde-O(sqrt(T)) regret, breaking the OTP bound. Numerical results align with theoretical claims in both settings.

Conclusion: The work clarifies how missing data changes the exploration–exploitation trade-off in sequential testing, provides practical policy designs with provable regret guarantees, and shows that removing missing-data-dependent rewards reverts the problem to a more favorable, sqrt(T) regime.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

*Allan Salihovic,Payam Abdisarabshali,Michael Langberg,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-Learning (X L) is a novel distributed learning framework that extends decentralization; the paper defines a design space for X L, links it to graph theory and Markov chains, and proposes open research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize decentralization in distributed learning, exploring the design freedom and paving a pathway for future research by drawing connections to graph theory and Markov chains.

Method: Conceptual perspective/vision article: defines X-Learning, analyzes its design considerations and degrees of freedom, and analyzes connections to graphs and Markov chains; proposes directions for future work.

distributed learning architecture that generalizes and extends the concept of
decentralization. Our goal is to present a vision for $\mathbb{X}$L,
introducing its unexplored design considerations and degrees of freedom. To
this end, we shed light on the intuitive yet non-trivial connections between
$\mathbb{X}$L, graph theory, and Markov chains. We also present a series of
open research directions to stimulate further research.

### [147] [Differentiable Entropy Regularization for Geometry and Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03733)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable estimator for range-partition entropy is introduced, enabling a trainable loss/regularizer; EntropyNet reorganizes data to low-entropy forms to speed up algorithms and applies entropy regularization to Transformer attention, yielding speedups and accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Range-partition entropy offers strong algorithmic guarantees and adapts to input sortedness, but has not been accessible to deep learning. Making it differentiable allows it to guide learning toward low-entropy data representations and more efficient computation.

Method: (i) propose a differentiable approximation of range-partition entropy; (ii) build EntropyNet to restructure data into low-entropy forms; (iii) extend regularization to Transformer attention and validate across tasks with theoretical approximation bounds and ablations.

Result: Geometry: up to 4.1× runtime speedups with negligible error (<0.2%). Deep learning: structured attention patterns leading to 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity vs L1 baselines. Theoretical bounds and extensive ablations support design choices.

Conclusion: Entropy-bounded computation is practically useful for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured representations, bridging geometry-inspired guarantees with deep learning performance.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

### [148] [Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators: Model Recovery in Function Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738)
*Bahareh Tolooshams,Ailsa Shen,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to recover sparse representations for neural operators by lifting autoencoders to higher/infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling interpretable, resolution-robust representations and faster, more accurate recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify and interpret representations of neural models, especially neural operators, whose representational properties are underexplored; tests the Platonic Representation Hypothesis in the operator regime and seeks mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Extend sparse autoencoders to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, creating lifted-SAE and SAE neural operators; compare the inference/training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE-based operators; analyze inductive biases from lifting and operator modules.

Result: Lifting and operator modules introduce inductive biases that enable faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions—an ability claimed to be unique to neural operators.

Conclusion: The approach offers a path toward mechanistic interpretability of neural operators and highlights the benefits of lifting and operator-module designs for representation learning across scales and resolutions.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

### [149] [Mapping on a Budget: Optimizing Spatial Data Collection for ML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03749)
*Livia Betti,Farooq Sanni,Gnouyaro Sogoyou,Togbe Agbagla,Cullen Molitor,Tamma Carleton,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizes spatial sampling for satellite-based ML under cost and budget constraints by formalizing the data collection problem and proposing new sampling methods, achieving notable gains across tasks and regions and guiding datasets like agricultural surveys in Togo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SatML is limited by sparse, clustered, and cost-heterogeneous labeled data. Existing work focuses on model/algorithmic solutions, not data-collection under budget. A formal framework is needed to decide where and how to collect data to maximize performance across domains, with practical relevance for policy and planning (e.g., in Togo).

Method: Introduce a formal optimization problem for spatial training-data selection under heterogeneous collection costs and budgets. Develop novel cost-aware sampling/selection methods and evaluate them through simulations across multiple continents (three) and tasks (four), plus analyses identifying regimes where optimization is most beneficial.

Result: Cost-aware, optimized sampling yields substantial performance gains over naive approaches; gains persist across diverse settings; the benefits are particularly pronounced under certain cost structures and data-collection constraints, suggesting broad applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework generalizes SatML data collection strategies across domains, enabling more efficient use of labeled data and informing data-collection decisions for scientists and policymakers, with immediate applicability to augment clustered agricultural surveys in regions like Togo.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

*Alvaro Almeida Gomez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven diffusion-geometry framework extends functions on manifolds, using diffusion maps with low-rank distance-based SVD reduction and online updates, achieving scalable accuracy improvements over NN/interpolation, validated on sparse CT reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately approximate real-valued functions from scattered samples on smooth manifolds under the manifold hypothesis, addressing high-dimensional data and scalability by leveraging diffusion geometry and online updating.

Method: (1) Use Diffusion Maps to extend pointwise function evaluations to the ambient space via diffusion heat flow and the Laplace-Beltrami operator. (2) Exploit low-rank structure of the distance matrix revealed by SVD for dimensionality reduction. (3) Implement online updating to incorporate new data efficiently, improving scalability. (4) Compare against classical feedforward networks and interpolation methods.

Result: Numerical experiments, including sparse CT reconstruction, show improved accuracy and efficiency over traditional feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods.

Conclusion: The method combines diffusion-geometry based function extension with low-rank distance approximations and online updates to deliver scalable, accurate function approximation on manifolds, with strong empirical performance on CT reconstruction tasks and potential broad applicability.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

### [151] [Learning an Adversarial World Model for Automated Curriculum Generation in MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03771)
*Brennen Hill*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adversarial co-evolution framework where a goal-conditioned Attacker learns to generate challenging world states for a Defender team, creating a self-scaling curriculum that yields emergent strategic behaviors and more robust, generalizable policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability gap in training environments by learning instrumental world models that can generate infinitely varied, challenging scenarios, reducing reliance on hand-crafted curricula and improving robustness and generalization.

Method: Introduce a cooperative Defender team and a goal-conditioned Attacker that learns an implicit world model to synthesize enemy configurations intended to exploit Defender weaknesses. The Attacker actively generates world states; the Defenders learn a cooperative policy to overcome them. The two agents co-evolve, producing a self-scaling curriculum where Attacker adaptations continually raise difficulty while Defender policies adapt accordingly, leading to novel training scenarios.

Result: Emergence of complex behaviors (e.g., flanking and shielding formations by the world model; coordinated focus-fire and spreading by Defenders). The framework yields an effectively infinite stream of diverse, relevant training scenarios and increased robustness/strategic depth.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution is a powerful approach for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth, robustness, and generalization by continuously adapting training environments to the agents' evolving capabilities.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-rank structure in reward matrices enables a transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity in sparse-reward RL; PAMC links matrix completion with RL to leverage this structure, offering strong theory and large-scale empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify fundamental reward-function properties that yield efficient learning under sparse rewards and quantify the benefits of exploiting low-rank structure.

Method: Introduce Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC), bridging matrix completion with RL through policy-dependent sampling. Provide impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, reward-free representation learning from dynamics, distribution-free confidence sets via conformal prediction, and robust completion guarantees under approximate low-rank structure. Validate with a pre-registered evaluation across 100 domains.

Result: Demonstrates a sharp exponential-to-polynomial sample complexity transition due to low-rank reward structure. PAMC achieves 1.6–2.1x sample efficiency over strong baselines, with about 20% additional compute. Structure is exploitable in over half of the tested domains.

Conclusion: Structural reward learning is a promising new paradigm with immediate implications for safety-critical, sample-expensive applications such as robotics and healthcare.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural
reward learning as a promising new paradigm, with immediate implications for
robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

### [153] [Online time series prediction using feature adjustment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03810)
*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT-Z introduces a latent-factor–aware online adapter for time series forecasting with delayed feedback; updates latent representations rather than only last-layer params, improving robustness under distribution shift and achieving strong online performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts in online time series arise from changes in underlying latent factors. Traditional online-learning methods typically update only surface parameters or use simple update strategies, which may be insufficient as latent factors evolve, especially under delayed feedback.

Method: Propose ADAPT-Z: an adapter module operating in Z-space that leverages current feature representations and historical gradient information to update latent-factor representations. Designed to handle delayed true values in multi-step forecasting via persistent tracking and automatic delta adjustment.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple datasets shows that ADAPT-Z consistently outperforms base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online-learning methods.

Conclusion: Shifting adaptation focus from updating last-layer parameters to updating latent-factor representations via a gradient-informed adapter yields robust online time series forecasting under distribution shift and delayed feedback.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: LiDAR-driven ML classifies indoor surfaces as semi-specular vs low-specular to model mmWave/sub-THz scattering, enabling scatter-aware maps for robust connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable high-frequency connectivity is blocked by surfaces; surface roughness and scattering behavior critically affect reflections. A scalable, data-driven method is needed to map specularity characteristics from LiDAR data for better beam management and digital twins.

Method: Collected a dataset of 78,000+ LiDAR points over 15 indoor materials, partitioned into 3 cm × 3 cm patches. Extracted patch-level features (elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, max-to-mean ratio) and trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural networks. Evaluated ensemble tree models; results show robustness and accuracy benefits.

Result: Ensemble tree-based models provided the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness. LiDAR-derived features effectively capture roughness-induced scattering, enabling phase-agnostic classification and generating scatter-aware maps.

Conclusion: The framework supports environment-aware connectivity via scatter-aware environment maps and digital twins, enabling adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and improved mmWave/sub-THz network performance.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study aims to improve severity prediction in traffic-accident data, addressing imbalanced data and feature redundancy by examining feature collinearity and applying unsupervised dimensionality reduction.

Method: First assess feature collinearity, then apply autoencoders for unsupervised dimensionality reduction, followed by training a dense neural network to classify accident severity; evaluation via cross-validation.

Result: The proposed deep neural network achieves up to 92% cross-validated accuracy in classifying accident severity, indicating good generalization on imbalanced data.

Conclusion: A deep neural architecture with autoencoder-based reduction is effective for traffic-accident severity classification and can aid traffic-safety analytics; further work could explore more robust imbalance handling and dataset-specific factors.

Abstract: Traffic accidents can be studied to mitigate the risk of further events.
Recent advances in machine learning have provided an alternative way to study
data associated with traffic accidents. New models achieve good generalization
and high predictive power over imbalanced data. In this research, we study
neural network-based models on data related to traffic accidents. We begin
analyzing relative feature colinearity and unsupervised dimensionality
reduction through autoencoders, followed by a dense network. The features are
related to traffic accident data and the target is to classify accident
severity. Our experiments show cross-validated results of up to 92% accuracy
when classifying accident severity using the proposed deep neural network.

### [156] [From Leiden to Pleasure Island: The Constant Potts Model for Community Detection as a Hedonic Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03834)
*Lucas Lopes Felipe,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Daniel Sadoc Menasche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes CPM as a potential hedonic game; shows convergence of local CPM optimization; defines robustness criteria; demonstrates accuracy gains in tracking with robust partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPM is effective for disjoint community detection but lacks principled understanding of efficiency, robustness, and accuracy; provide game-theoretic analysis to explain and improve performance.

Method: Decompose CPM Hamiltonian into local utilities; show local gains equal global gain; prove better-response dynamics converge to equilibrium in pseudo-polynomial time; introduce two robustness stability criteria (strict and weighted-sum with resolution parameter). Evaluate via community-tracking experiments bootstrapping Leiden with partial ground-truth.

Result: Convergence of local CPM optimization; defined robustness criteria; empirical evidence that robust partitions improve accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities in tracking tasks.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic perspective yields efficient, robust, and accurate CPM-based community detection; provides convergence guarantees and practical benefits for tracking tasks.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

### [157] [Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03837)
*Kimia Ehsani,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight BEV injection module augments multimodal LLMs with 3D spatial context to predict V2I link quality, using BEV data fused with ego input and co-simulated sensor/wireless data; shows consistent accuracy gains across LoS/NLoS, availability, and blockage tasks, with larger gains under adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs offer multimodal adaptability but lack robust 3D spatial understanding necessary for V2I link prediction. Injecting a BEV spatial context can bridge this gap, enabling better reasoning about environment and link conditions.

Method: Construct a BEV of the environment by aggregating sensing data from neighboring vehicles; fuse the BEV with the ego vehicle's inputs to provide spatial context to the LLM. Use a CARLA-MATLAB co-simulation to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios. Programmatically extract instructions and ground-truth responses from the ray-tracing outputs. Evaluate on three V2I tasks: LoS vs NLoS classification, link availability, and blockage prediction.

Result: The BEV injection framework yields consistent improvements over an ego-only baseline across all tasks. Macro-averaged accuracy increases up to 13.9% overall, with gains up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions, indicating robustness in adverse settings.

Conclusion: BEV-based spatial augmentation is an effective, plug-and-play enhancement for multimodal learning in V2I link prediction. The approach strengthens spatial awareness and prediction reliability, though real-world validation and latency considerations remain for deployment.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

*Yang Chen,Xiao Lin,Bo Yan,Libo Zhang,Jiamou Liu,Neset Özkan Tan,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a deep latent variable mean-field game IRL model to infer heterogeneous reward functions from demonstrations across related tasks, without knowing underlying contexts and without changing the MFG framework; shows improved performance over existing MFG-IRL methods on simulations and a taxi-pricing case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the homogeneity assumption in IRL for mean-field games, which limits learning from demonstrations that come from heterogeneous and unknown objectives in real-world multi-agent systems.

Method: Introduce a deep latent variable MFG model that captures task heterogeneity. The IRL procedure infers reward functions across structurally similar tasks via latent variables, without requiring context labels or modifying the base MFG model."

Result: The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs on both simulated scenarios and a real-world taxi-ride pricing problem, demonstrating superior ability to recover rewards across heterogeneous but related tasks.

Conclusion: A latent-variable MFG-IRL framework enables robust reward inference in multi-agent settings with heterogeneous objectives, enhancing the practical applicability of IRL for mean-field games by handling unknown contexts.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

### [159] [Data-Augmented Quantization-Aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03850)
*Justin Kur,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-augmentation selection metric for quantization-aware KD improves low-precision models by ranking augmentations through contextual mutual information and label consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited study on how input transformations (DA) interact with quantization-aware KD, especially for low-precision models; there is a need to automatically select beneficial DAs with minimal overhead.

Method: Introduce a metric that scores DAs by maximizing contextual mutual information (CMI) while keeping per-class predictions aligned with ground-truth on average; rank DAs to select the best; compatible with any KD/QAT setup; requires little extra training.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that using the metric to choose DAs significantly improves state-of-the-art KD/QAT results across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Automated DA selection via CMI-based metric is effective, generalizable, and reduces training overhead, enhancing quantized KD performance.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

### [160] [MillGNN: Learning Multi-Scale Lead-Lag Dependencies for Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03852)
*Binqing Wu,Zongjiang Shang,Jianlong Huang,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MillGNN introduces scale-aware lead-lag graph learning and hierarchical message passing to forecast MTS by capturing multi-scale lead-lag dependencies; it outperforms 16 SOTA on 11 datasets for both long- and short-term forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTS methods capture intra-/inter-series dependencies but neglect hierarchical lead-lag relationships across multiple grouping scales, limiting ability to model complex systems' dynamics.

Method: Proposes MillGNN with (1) scale-specific lead-lag graph learning using cross-correlation and decaying features from real-time inputs and lags to learn scale-wise lead-lag dependencies; (2) hierarchical lead-lag message passing to propagate intra- and inter-scale lead-lag effects across multiple grouping scales.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 11 datasets shows MillGNN achieves superior forecasting performance for both long- and short-term horizons compared to 16 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MillGNN provides a data-driven, interpretable, and scalable approach to modeling multi-scale lead-lag dynamics in MTS, improving forecasting accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: An MLP model using GA-selected urinary peptide biomarkers to non-invasively diagnose CHD, achieving high accuracy with SMOTE-balanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a non-invasive, accurate CHD diagnostic method leveraging urinary peptides and address class imbalance.

Method: GA-based feature selection of 50 peptide biomarkers; SMOTE-balanced dataset (345 CHD, 345 controls); MLP with 3 hidden layers x 60 neurons; two-output neurons; stratified validation.

Result: Precision, sensitivity, specificity = 95.67%; F1 = 0.9565; AUC = 0.9748; MCC = 0.9134; Cohen's kappa = 0.9131.

Conclusion: The approach yields a highly accurate, robust non-invasive CHD diagnostic tool with strong discriminative performance and clinical potential.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

*Zhiyu Wang,Arian Jamasb,Mustafa Hajij,Alex Morehead,Luke Braithwaite,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Topotein introduces a hierarchical topological framework (PCC + TCPNet) for protein representation learning, leveraging multi-level geometric information and SE(3)-equivariant message passing; it yields state-of-the-art results on four PRL tasks, especially fold classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PRL approaches based on sequences or flat graphs struggle to capture the inherent hierarchical organization of protein structures. A framework that preserves geometry across multiple levels (residues, secondary structures, whole protein) and uses SE(3)-equivariant processing could better capture structure-function relationships.

Method: Introduce Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) to represent proteins at multiple hierarchical levels (residues, secondary structures, full protein) while preserving geometric information. Develop Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) with SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical structures to capture multi-scale structural patterns.

Result: TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks across four PRL tasks, with particular strength in fold classification that depends on secondary structure arrangements.

Conclusion: Hierarchical topological features are important for protein analysis; the PCC+TCPNet framework demonstrates effective integration of multi-scale geometric information, enabling improved PRL performance and suggesting potential for broader applications in structure-function prediction.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

TL;DR: This work analyzes computational limits in online learning under per-round arithmetic-operation caps, establishing lower bounds, solving an agnostic bandit-feedback mistake-bounded problem, and extending results to operation caps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how explicit computational resource constraints (arithmetic operations) affect the mistake-bound online learning model, and to connect agnostic bandit-feedback results with cap-constrained learning.

Method: Derives general lower bounds on the minimum number of arithmetic operations per round required to learn arbitrary families of functions with finitely many mistakes; adapts and extends techniques from Filmus et al. (2024) and Geneson & Tang (2024) to the agnostic, bandit-feedback setting and to the framework with operation caps.

Result: General lower bounds on per-round arithmetic operations for learning finite-mistake function families; a resolution of the agnostic mistake-bounded online learning problem with bandit feedback in the cited works; and an extension of these results to the setting of operation caps.

Conclusion: The paper advances theoretical understanding of resource-constrained online learning, showing that meaningful mistake-bounded learning is possible under explicit arithmetic-operation caps and that bandit-feedback agnostic results can be extended to cap settings.

Abstract: We investigate the mistake-bound model of online learning with caps on the
number of arithmetic operations per round. We prove general bounds on the
minimum number of arithmetic operations per round that are necessary to learn
an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a
problem on agnostic mistake-bounded online learning with bandit feedback from
(Filmus et al, 2024) and (Geneson \& Tang, 2024). We also extend this result to
the setting of operation caps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Formal verification of onboard neural networks using Marabou to quantify local robustness for satellite fault detection, enabling predictable tolerance to input perturbations and improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite fault failures are costly; onboard AI must be highly dependable; formal robustness verification offers trust under uncertainty.

Method: Apply Marabou to the neural networks in the hybrid AI fault-detection system to compute input perturbation bounds where the output remains stable (local robustness).

Result: Marabou provides quantitative perturbation thresholds, enabling assessment of the model's sensitivity and increasing trust in performance under input variations.

Conclusion: Integrating formal verification of local robustness into onboard AI improves dependability of satellite fault detection and reduces operational risk.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Align ML healthcare models with clinical experiential learning by enforcing clinician-informed constraints to address underspecification; demonstrates alignment without loss of predictive performance and explores feedback-driven alignment with clinicians in non-generative risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge gap between model behavior and clinicians' experiential knowledge; address underspecification in clinical ML to improve trust, interpretability, and applicability.

Method: Identify inconsistencies in model behavior; incorporate survey-derived clinical constraints into the ML pipeline in a prostate cancer outcome prediction task; evaluate performance and behavior across degrees of underspecification; extend with a randomized clinician experiment to assess feedback-driven alignment in non-generative models.

Result: Alignment with clinical knowledge is achievable without sacrificing performance; constrained and unconstrained models show larger prediction differences, which translate into greater differences in clinical interpretation when clinicians assess the outputs.

Conclusion: It is feasible to align ML models with clinical experiential learning through constraint-based incorporation of clinician knowledge, maintaining performance while improving interpretability; further exploration of clinician-guided, feedback-driven alignment in non-generative clinical risk models is warranted.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

### [166] [FedQuad: Federated Stochastic Quadruplet Learning to Mitigate Data Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04107)
*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQuad is a federated learning method that reduces data heterogeneity by aligning intra-class variance across clients and increasing inter-class variance, using a metric-learning-like objective to pull similar pairs together and push dissimilar pairs apart. It achieves superior performance on CIFAR-10/100 with many clients and under varied data distributions, and the paper also analyzes metric-learning strategies in supervised and FL contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from non-IID data across clients, especially when data per client is scarce or imbalanced. This heterogeneity harms global model generalization. A method that disentangles client representations in the shared feature space could mitigate aggregation biases and improve robustness.

Method: Propose FedQuad, a metric-learning-inspired objective that minimizes distances between similar (intra-class) pairs and maximizes distances between negative (inter-class) pairs across clients. This reduces intra-class variance and increases inter-class variance across clients, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space during FL aggregation. Evaluates under various data distributions and many clients, comparing to existing approaches, and includes analysis of metric-learning strategies in both supervised and federated settings.

Result: FedQuad demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches across CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under diverse data distributions and a large number of clients, indicating its effectiveness at mitigating data heterogeneity. The study also provides a detailed analysis of metric-learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning paradigms.

Conclusion: Targeting intra- and inter-class variance across clients with a metric-learning objective helps to alleviate the negative impact of data heterogeneity on the FL global model. FedQuad represents a promising direction for representational learning in FL, with broader implications for metric-learning strategies in both supervised and FL contexts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: SP-CCI augments conformal counterfactual inference with synthetic counterfactual data powered by a pre-trained model, improving interval tightness while preserving coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain reliable, non-conservative prediction intervals for individual counterfactual outcomes, addressing conservativeness of existing CCI especially under treatment imbalance and scarce counterfactual samples.

Method: Augment calibration set with synthetic counterfactual labels; apply conformal calibration via risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a debiasing step guided by prediction-powered inference (PPI); validity under exact and approximate importance weighting.

Result: SP-CCI yields tighter prediction intervals than standard CCI while maintaining marginal coverage; empirical results across datasets show consistent interval width reduction across settings.

Conclusion: SP-CCI provides tighter, valid prediction intervals for individual counterfactuals by leveraging synthetic data and RCPS-based conformal calibration, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

TL;DR: A theoretical and empirical study on fairness in algorithmic recourse; introduces a social-burden fairness framework and the MISOB algorithm, reducing social burden across groups without harming classifier accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is concern that fairness guarantees in algorithmic recourse (the actionable steps after a negative decision) are incomplete, and existing equal-cost paradigms may be insufficient. Regulations require actionable recourse, and researchers seek a holistic link between recourse and classifier fairness.

Method: Provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally linking recourse fairness with classifier fairness, critique the equal-cost paradigm, introduce a social-burden-based fairness framework, and propose the MISOB algorithm (and its applicability under real-world conditions). Empirical evaluation on real datasets to assess social burden and accuracy.

Result: MISOB reduces social burden across all groups in real-world datasets while preserving overall classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: A practical, generalizable fairness framework for recourse is proposed, with MISOB offering a viable solution that tightens fairness guarantees in both recourse and classification without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

*Benoît Ronval,Pierre Dupont,Siegfried Nijssen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAGAL uses an agentic, LLM-driven workflow to generate synthetic tabular data without additional LLM training, achieving competitive downstream classifier performance and surpassing non-training-based baselines, while enabling incorporation of external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve ML classification by augmenting data with high-quality synthetic tabular data; enable rapid, knowledge-rich data generation without additional LLM fine-tuning.

Method: An agentic workflow (TAGAL) that leverages LLMs to iteratively generate synthetic tabular data and incorporate external knowledge, with feedback loops to improve data quality, without further LLM training.

Result: Across diverse datasets, synthetic data leads to competitive downstream classifier performance (even when trained on synthetic data only or with real+synthetic data); TAGAL matches state-of-the-art methods that require LLM training and outperforms many training-free baselines; data similarity between real and synthetic is assessed.

Conclusion: Agentic, LLM-driven data generation is a promising direction for synthetic data creation, offering competitive performance without LLM fine-tuning and enabling integration of external knowledge, thus opening new avenues for LLM-based data generation methods.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

### [170] [Attention as an Adaptive Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154)
*Peter Racioppo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA) introduces a dynamics-aware attention by modeling inputs as observations of a linear SDE, enabling efficient uncertainty propagation via the differential Lyapunov equation; a robust, dynamics-based reweighting replaces traditional dot-product, with a simplified version matching standard attention in a certain limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention lacks a principled dynamics and uncertainty model for sequences; injecting a learnable linear dynamics model may yield more robust, interpretable attention and potentially better modeling of temporal structure, while preserving complexity.

Method: Assumes linear SDE with simultaneously diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances. Uses closed-form differential Lyapunov solution to propagate pairwise uncertainties and derive maximum-likelihood attention weights as residual-based reweightings. Adds a constraint on eigenvalues to obtain a simplified variant with identical compute/memory to vanilla attention.

Result: The approach yields a new attention mechanism whose behavior reduces to ordinary dot-product attention in the limit of vanishing dynamics and process noise (small-angle approximation). The simplified variant keeps the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention.

Conclusion: AFA provides a principled, dynamics-informed alternative to traditional attention, unifying probabilistic inference with attention weighting and offering robustness benefits while retaining comparable efficiency; it bridges to standard attention under common limiting assumptions.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

*Jules Cauzinille,Marius Miron,Olivier Pietquin,Masato Hagiwara,Ricard Marxer,Arnaud Rey,Benoit Favre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Speech-based self-supervised models (HuBERT, WavLM, XEUS) trained on human speech transfer well to bioacoustic tasks, providing rich latent representations across taxa; linear probing and time-aware architectures show competitive performance to bioacoustic-specific models, with noise and frequency range influencing results; underscores potential of SSL for bioacoustic research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Can self-supervised speech models learn transferable representations for bioacoustic detection/classification, enabling data-efficient analysis across diverse animal sounds without task-specific pretraining.

Method: Evaluate SSL speech models on bioacoustic tasks. Use linear probing on time-averaged representations; extend to time-wise information with different downstream architectures; study impact of frequency range and noise; compare to fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and noise-robust pretraining.

Result: Models produce rich latent representations across taxa; linear probing reveals model properties; time-aware architectures can leverage temporal information; frequency range and noise affect performance; results competitive with bioacoustic pre-trained models and benefit from noise-robust pretraining.

Conclusion: Speech-based SSL is a promising, data-efficient framework for bioacoustic research, enabling cross-taxa transfer and robust detection/classification; further work on architecture choices, frequency/noise handling, and broader taxa recommended.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in
speech processing, but their effectiveness on non-speech data remains
underexplored. We study the transfer learning capabilities of such models on
bioacoustic detection and classification tasks. We show that models such as
HuBERT, WavLM, and XEUS can generate rich latent representations of animal
sounds across taxa. We analyze the models properties with linear probing on
time-averaged representations. We then extend the approach to account for the
effect of time-wise information with other downstream architectures. Finally,
we study the implication of frequency range and noise on performance. Notably,
our results are competitive with fine-tuned bioacoustic pre-trained models and
show the impact of noise-robust pre-training setups. These findings highlight
the potential of speech-based self-supervised learning as an efficient
framework for advancing bioacoustic research.

### [172] [Privacy Risks in Time Series Forecasting: User- and Record-Level Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04169)
*Nicolas Johansson,Tobias Olsson,Daniel Nilsson,Johan Östman,Fazeleh Hoseini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two new membership inference attacks for time-series forecasting—an adapted multivariate LiRA and a novel end-to-end Deep Time Series (DTS) attack—reveal strong privacy risks, often enabling perfect user-level detection; benchmarks against classification-attacks and strong forecasting models (LSTM, N-HiTS) on TUH-EEG and ELD show vulnerability increases with longer horizons and smaller training sets, establishing new baselines for privacy risk in time-series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks have been extensively studied for classification models, but their implications for time-series forecasting are largely unexplored. The work aims to quantify privacy risks in forecasting and advance attack methodologies tailored to sequential data, addressing a notable gap in privacy research.

Method: Introduce two attacks: (i) adapting multivariate LiRA (a state-of-the-art MIA for classification) to time-series forecasting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. Compare against adapted versions of leading classification attacks. Evaluate on TUH-EEG and ELD datasets using LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS architectures under record- and user-level threat models.

Result: Forecasting models are vulnerable to MIAs, with user-level attacks often achieving near-perfect detection. The proposed LiRA-adapted and DTS attacks provide the strongest performance across several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk in time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: Privacy risks from MIAs in time-series forecasting are real and align with broader privacy trends in AI (e.g., larger models). Longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations intensify vulnerability, underscoring the need for privacy-preserving methods and robust evaluation baselines in forecasting models.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

### [173] [Comment on "A Note on Over-Smoothing for Graph Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04178)
*Razi Hasson,Reuven Guetta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dirichlet energy of GNN embeddings decays exponentially with depth under mild spectral conditions (including Leaky-ReLU); extends to spectral polynomial filters; experiments show when energy can increase, suggesting practical remedies for over-smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify and extend the theoretical understanding of over-smoothing in GNNs by analyzing Dirichlet energy under broad spectral conditions and common nonlinearities (e.g., Leaky-ReLU); respond to prior work (Cai & Wang 2020) with stronger or broadened results.

Method: Theoretical spectral analysis of GNN propagation operators to derive bounds on Dirichlet energy across layers; show exponential decay under mild spectral assumptions; extend the analysis to spectral polynomial filters; provide a short, self-contained proof for the Leaky-ReLU case; complement with experiments (edge deletion and weight amplification) to illustrate energy behavior.

Result: Dirichlet energy of node embeddings decreases exponentially with depth under the stated spectral conditions, and this decay also holds for spectral polynomial filters; there is a short proof specifically for the Leaky-ReLU case; experiments reveal regimes where Dirichlet energy can increase, suggesting practical levers to counter over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The work strengthens the theoretical understanding of over-smoothing via Dirichlet energy, showing a strong tendency toward energy decay with depth under broad spectral conditions and offering practical insights (via edge/weight manipulations) on when and how over-smoothing can be mitigated.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

### [174] [Set Block Decoding is a Language Model Inference Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04185)
*Itai Gat,Heli Ben-Hamu,Marton Havasi,Daniel Haziza,Jeremy Reizenstein,Gabriel Synnaeve,David Lopez-Paz,Brian Karrer,Yaron Lipman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Set Block Decoding (SBD) speeds up autoregressive generation by sampling multiple, non-consecutive future tokens in parallel within a single architecture, achieving 3–5x fewer forward passes with unchanged accuracy and no extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference cost and memory bottlenecks during decoding limit practical deployment of autoregressive language models; a simple, compatible acceleration method is needed that works with existing models and caches.

Method: Integrates standard next-token prediction (NTP) with masked token prediction (MATP) in one model, enabling parallel sampling of future tokens (not necessarily consecutive). Leverages discrete-diffusion–style solvers for search over token blocks. Requires no architectural changes or additional training hyperparameters and remains compatible with exact KV caching; can be realized by fine-tuning existing NTP models.

Result: Demonstrated on Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, achieving a 3–5× reduction in the number of forward passes during generation while maintaining performance equal to NTP training.

Conclusion: SBD offers a practical, low-friction path to substantial generation speedups without sacrificing accuracy; it can be adopted by fine-tuning existing NTP models and requires no architectural changes.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

### [175] [One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208)
*Hao-Nan Shi,Ting-Ji Huang,Lu Han,De-Chuan Zhan,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast builds a One-Embedding-Fits-All model zoo to dynamically select among time-series foundation models, achieving strong zero-shot forecasting performance while preserving single-model efficiency and easy integration of new models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no universally best time-series foundation model (TSFM). Different models excel on different temporal patterns, so leveraging their complementary strengths can improve zero-shot forecasting by combining models adaptively.

Method: Introduce One-Embedding-Fits-All: represent every model in a unified embedding space with a single embedding per model. Dynamically assemble a model zoo and perform efficient similarity matching to select optimal models for each forecasting task, enabling easy addition of new models with negligible overhead and maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM.

Result:  ZooCast achieves strong zero-shot forecasting performance on the GIFT-Eval benchmark while preserving the computational efficiency of a single TSFM. It also supports progressive accuracy gains as new models are released sequentially with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: ZooCast provides a practical, scalable framework to exploit the diversity of TSFMs by maintaining a compact model zoo and a universal embedding space, enabling dynamic, task-specific model selection and easy incorporation of new models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

### [176] [Why Can't I See My Clusters? A Precision-Recall Approach to Dimensionality Reduction Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04222)
*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-phase DR framework uses precision and recall as supervised metrics for the relationship phase to measure how well modeled similarities align with an expected cluster structure, aiding hyperparameter tuning, artifact detection, and reliability of visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR often fails to reveal the anticipated cluster structure in projections, and existing metrics either ignore the why or assess only projection quality. There is a need for diagnostics that evaluate whether the relationship modeling step preserves the expected structure.

Method: The method builds on a two-phase DR framework: (1) a relationship phase that models similarity relationships, and (2) a mapping phase that projects data accordingly. The authors define precision and recall for the relationship phase to quantify alignment with a predefined cluster structure given some labels. They illustrate the approach using t-SNE and UMAP and validate it across various usage scenarios to show how these metrics can guide hyperparameter tuning and interpretation.

Result: The proposed precision and recall metrics quantify how well the learned relationships reflect the expected cluster structure, enabling guidance for hyperparameter choices, detection of projection artifacts, and a determination of whether the intended structure is captured, thereby making DR more efficient and reliable.

Conclusion: The metrics provide interpretable diagnostics for the relationship phase of DR, enabling better understanding and tuning of DR processes and more reliable visualization of the target structures.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

### [177] [Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04226)
*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Defines long-range dependency as the sensitivity of hidden states to past inputs (derivative), compares SSMs and Transformers, finds SSMs exhibit exponential decay of long-range dependency with sequence length while attention offers more flexible, non-exponential decay; proposes a new SSM hidden-state update formulation and proves stability under Gaussian inputs to combine flexibility with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a theoretical gap in understanding and quantifying long-range dependency modeling in state-space models and transformers. The work aims to formalize LRD, compare capabilities, and guide improvements.

Method: Formally define LRD as the derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs. Analyze SSMs showing exponential decay of LRD. Compare to Transformer attention which can implement non-exponential decay. Propose a new hidden-state update formulation for SSMs to gain flexible LRD and prove stability under a standard Gaussian input distribution.

Result: LRD in SSMs decays exponentially with sequence length. Attention mechanisms in Transformers are more flexible and not restricted to exponential decay, potentially performing better with sufficient data and resources. A new SSM hidden-state update formulation is proposed to combine flexibility with computational efficiency, and its stability is proven under Gaussian inputs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical framework for LRD in sequence models, highlighting a fundamental limitation of traditional SSMs and the flexibility of attention. It motivates hybrid designs that merge attention’s expressive power with SSMs’ efficiency and sets the stage for further theoretical and empirical exploration.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

*Qifeng Tan,Shusen Yang,Xuebin Ren,Yikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified framework connects layer-wise noise injection in DP deep learning to privacy-utility tradeoffs; introduces SNR-consistent noise allocation; outperforms prior schemes in centralized and federated settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) offer flexible noise injection but lack rigorous grounding on how noise allocation affects privacy-utility tradeoffs; need principled analysis to improve efficiency and consistency across layers.

Method: Develop an analytical framework that maps layer-wise noise injection to optimization objectives and privacy budgets; diagnose existing allocation strategies for inter-layer SNR consistency; propose a SNR-consistent allocation that balances signal preservation with budget usage; validate theoretically and empirically in centralized and federated learning.

Result: SNR-consistent allocation improves signal preservation and makes more efficient use of the privacy budget, yielding better privacy-utility tradeoffs; the framework diagnoses prior methods and provides guidance for adaptive and effective noise-injection schemes.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for LGM noise allocation, demonstrates practical improvements over existing strategies, and offers diagnostic tools and design guidance for future adaptive noise schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning–based synthetic heart failure datasets were generated from 12,552 patients using five models (TVAE, normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, TabDDPM). SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM gave the highest fidelity; survival prediction with C-indices ~0.71–0.76 closely matched real data; privacy preserved. A public synthetic dataset is proposed to enable HF research while addressing data-sharing barriers.


<details>

Motivation: Overcome data access and privacy barriers in heart failure research by providing high-fidelity, shareable synthetic data that preserve patient confidentiality.

Method: Generate synthetic datasets from institutional data (n=12,552) using five DL models: TVAE, normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, TabDDPM. Evaluate data utility via statistical similarity metrics, survival prediction performance (C-index), and privacy against re-identification attacks.

Result: SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM achieved high fidelity to the original data (after histogram equalization); SurvivalGAN: C-index 0.71–0.76; TVAE: 0.73–0.76; real-data performance: 0.73–0.76; privacy tests showed protection against re-identification attacks.

Conclusion: DL-based synthetic data generation can yield high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research; the public synthetic dataset addresses data-sharing barriers and supports predictive modelling in HF.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational
autoencoder (TVAE), normalizing flow, ADSGAN, SurvivalGAN, and tabular
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data

### [180] [RL's Razor: Why Online Reinforcement Learning Forgets Less](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04259)
*Idan Shenfeld,Jyothish Pari,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL vs SFT: RL preserves existing knowledge better while achieving similar task performance; forgetting correlates with KL divergence between fine-tuned and base model; on-policy RL biases towards KL-minimal solutions; SFT can drift away; this is encapsulated in RL's Razor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fine-tuning via reinforcement learning compares to supervised fine-tuning in terms of retaining prior capabilities and knowledge when adapting to a new task.

Method: Analytical and empirical study comparing RL and SFT on large language models and robotic foundation models. Measure forgetting via KL divergence between the fine-tuned policy and the base policy evaluated on the new task; investigate on-policy RL bias toward KL-minimal solutions; provide theoretical justification for reduced KL change under on-policy RL.

Result: RL achieves similar task performance to SFT but preserves prior knowledge and capabilities to a significantly greater extent. The degree of forgetting scales with the distributional shift, quantified by the KL-divergence from the base policy to the fine-tuned policy on the new task. On-policy RL naturally biases toward KL-minimal solutions among all possible solutions to the new task, while SFT can converge to distributions far from the base model. Experimental validation on large language models and robotic foundation models supports these findings, complemented by theoretical explanations for why on-policy RL yields smaller KL changes.

Conclusion: Propose RL's Razor: among all ways to solve a new task, RL favors solutions that are closest in KL to the original model. This explains the superior knowledge retention with RL and provides guidance for choosing fine-tuning methods when preserving prior capabilities is important.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [181] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work presents a DP-aware multi-objective optimization framework that directly models the Pareto front and uses curve-based user preferences, enabling faster and less interactive convergence to the optimal privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In DP settings, standard surrogate-based MOO is inefficient because it ignores the problem’s structure. Notably, a Pareto-optimal point can be produced by maximizing accuracy for a fixed privacy level, suggesting a more direct, DP-specific approach.

Method: The authors derive the shape of the DP trade-off, model the Pareto front directly, and replace pairwise feedback with an informative interaction: users select their preferred trade-off from hypothetical curves.

Result: Empirical evaluation on DP logistic regression and deep transfer learning over six real datasets shows faster convergence to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with substantially less computation and user interaction than baselines.

Conclusion: Exploiting the DP problem structure to directly model the Pareto front and using curve-based user feedback yields an efficient, scalable method for identifying preferred privacy-utility trade-offs, with potential applicability beyond the tested settings.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

### [182] [A Primer on Causal and Statistical Dataset Biases for Fair and Robust Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04295)
*Charles Jones,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract argues that ML models fail in real-world, high-stakes, socially sensitive domains and identifies two underexplored failure modes—'no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability'—critiques current fair representation learning, and outlines directions for safer deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why ML fails in high-stakes real-world settings (e.g., medical diagnosis) and improve fairness and safety in deployment by identifying fundamental structural causes and proposing future research directions.

Method: The paper offers a conceptual/analytical treatment: defines and motivates two failure-prone structures ('no fair lunch' and 'subgroup separability'), analyzes why current fair representation approaches fall short, and outlines potential paths forward for advancing fair ML in image analysis.

Result: Identification of two core failure modes affecting fairness and reliability in image-based ML under real-world deployment; a critique of current fair representation methods; and proposed directions for future research to address these gaps.

Conclusion: Concludes that existing fair representation approaches are insufficient for the highlighted issues and calls for new methodologies and evaluation strategies to safely deploy ML in high-stakes, socially sensitive settings, with explicit attention to domain-specific causal/statistical structures.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

### [183] [Using causal abstractions to accelerate decision-making in complex bandit problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04296)
*Joel Dyer,Nicholas Bishop,Anisoara Calinescu,Michael Wooldridge,Fabio Massimo Zennaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AT-UCB uses causal abstraction to exploit multi-level CMABs, achieving lower regret by cheap coarse exploration followed by restricted UCB on promising actions; supported by theoretical regret bounds and empirical tests on epidemiological simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision problems often admit CMAB formulations at multiple abstraction levels, but there is no general method to leverage cross-level information to improve learning efficiency; the work aims to bridge this gap by combining causal abstraction with UCB.

Method: Propose AT-UCB which first explores a cheap, coarse-grained CMAB using causal abstraction to share information across instances, then applies a restricted UCB on a subset of potentially optimal actions in the target CMAB; provides a new upper bound on cumulative regret.

Result: Theoretically, derives an upper bound on cumulative regret showing improvements over standard UCB; empirically, demonstrates significant regret reductions in epidemiological simulators with different resolutions and costs.

Conclusion: AT-UCB effectively leverages CA-based abstractions to reduce regret and computational burden in CMABs across abstraction levels, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical gains for multi-resolution simulators.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

*Haley Dozier,Althea Henslee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven behavioral model to profile energy usage on Army installations for resilience, enabling baseline disruption impact assessment and benchmarking of resilience measures via multimodal building-level data with open-access illustrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change and extreme weather threaten Army infrastructure; most installations rely on external energy/water, creating vulnerabilities. A baseline understanding of energy usage is needed to improve resilience and readiness.

Method: Develops a data-driven, multimodal, building-level energy usage model that can analyze, predict, and cluster usage patterns. Uses similarly structured open-access data to illustrate the methodology due to Army data access limitations.

Result: Conceptual framework and methodology description with anticipated capabilities; no empirical results reported in the abstract; intended to enable baseline disruption impact assessment and benchmarking of resilience measures.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a data-driven approach to characterize energy usage behavior on installations to support resilience planning and evaluation of mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

### [185] [Parking Availability Prediction via Fusing Multi-Source Data with A Self-Supervised Learning Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Inverted Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04362)
*Yin Huang,Yongqi Dong,Youhua Tang,Li Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spatio-temporal self-supervised transformer (SST-iTransformer) uses K-means parking zones and multi-source demand data to predict parking availability, achieving state-of-the-art MSE on Chengdu data; ride-hailing data provides the biggest gains, and spatial dependencies are crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban private car growth worsens parking shortages, necessitating accurate prediction of parking availability. Existing models struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and to integrate diverse data sources for parking demand.

Method: Establish parking cluster zones (PCZs) via K-means, fuse demand signals from metro, bus, ride-hailing, and taxi data with parking lots, introduce self-supervised pretext tasks (masking/reconstruction) to learn spatio-temporal representations, and employ SST-iTransformer with a dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention for long-term temporal dependencies (via patching) and Channel Attention for cross-variate interactions (inverted dimensions). Benchmark against Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer on Chengdu data.

Result: SST-iTransformer outperforms baselines with the lowest MSE and competitive MAE; ablation shows ride-hailing data yields the largest gains, taxi data also helps, while bus/metro features add marginal value; removing historical data from spatially correlated PCZs degrades performance, highlighting the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed SST-iTransformer effectively models spatio-temporal dependencies and leverages multi-source data to improve parking availability prediction; clustering-based PCZs and the emphasis on ride-hailing data are key contributors, and spatial correlation considerations are essential for performance gains.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

### [186] [When three experiments are better than two: Avoiding intractable correlated aleatoric uncertainty by leveraging a novel bias--variance tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04363)
*Paul Scherer,Andreas Kirsch,Jake P. Taylor-King*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a bias-aware active learning framework grounded in the bias-variance decomposition to reduce inter-round bias in real-world experiments, and a cobias-covariance mechanism with eigendecomposition for batching historical data; in batched settings with a quadratic estimator, it outperforms BALD and Least Confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experiments exhibit heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty that can be correlated across batches. This induces bias between experimental rounds, reducing sample efficiency. There is a need for active learning strategies that explicitly minimize inter-round bias and leverage historical data to improve learning under noise.

Method: 1) Decompose mean squared error into epistemic uncertainty, bias^2, and aleatoric uncertainty. 2) Propose difference-based active learning strategies that aim to minimize the bias between successive experimental rounds, applicable to both noisy and noise-free models. 3) Introduce a cobias-covariance relationship to exploit historical data quadratically, paired with an eigendecomposition-based batching strategy. 4) In batched settings, apply a quadratic estimator within the cobias framework.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that the proposed difference-based method leveraging the cobias-covariance relationship, when used with a batched quadratic estimator, outperforms canonical active learning methods, specifically BALD and Least Confidence.

Conclusion: Bias-focused active learning coupled with cobias-based history exploitation provides improved sample efficiency and performance in realistic, noisy experimental scenarios. The approach enables effective batching via eigendecomposition and demonstrates gains over established AL baselines.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

### [187] [PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04377)
*Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Jie Ye,Xian-He Sun,Anthony Kougkas,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath,Bogdan Nicolae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PagedEviction introduces a fine-grained, block-wise KV-cache eviction for vLLM's PagedAttention, reducing memory usage with maintained or improved accuracy on long-context Llama models, without modifying CUDA kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching becomes a memory bottleneck as sequence length grows, limiting long-context generation. Existing approaches rely on token-level importance or cross-page evictions and may not align well with paged memory layouts. There is a need for a memory-efficient eviction strategy that integrates with paged attention.

Method: Proposes PagedEviction, a fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that uses block-wise eviction tailored to paged memory layouts and integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring changes to CUDA attention kernels.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on the LongBench benchmark shows improved memory efficiency and better accuracy than baselines on long-context tasks.

Conclusion: PagedEviction effectively reduces KV cache memory footprint in vLLM’s PagedAttention while preserving or improving accuracy, and is compatible with existing kernels across multiple Llama models.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

*Zidong Wang,Yiyuan Zhang,Xiaoyu Yue,Xiangyu Yue,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiM introduces an exact continuous-time dynamics equation for finite-time state transitions, enabling an arbitrary-step generative process that smoothly interpolates between single leaps and fine refinements. With a compact 865M parameter model, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity across step counts and scales to very high resolutions (4096x4096).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off in diffusion-based generation between computational cost (many steps) and output quality (potentially limited by few-step methods) by moving beyond training objectives that only optimize infinitesimal dynamics or endpoint prediction; provide a unified, exact finite-time transition mechanism.

Method: Define an exact continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically captures state transitions over any finite interval. Build Transition Models (TiM) that can operate across arbitrary numbers of steps, from coarse leaps to fine refinements, and employ a native-resolution strategy to maintain high fidelity at large image sizes; achieve strong results with 865M parameters.

Result: TiM surpasses state-of-the-art models including SD3.5 (8B) and FLUX.1 (12B) across all tested step counts, exhibits monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases, and delivers high-fidelity results up to 4096x4096 resolutions.

Conclusion: The Transition Model framework provides a flexible, efficient generative paradigm that bridges the fidelity-speed gap in diffusion-based generation, achieving high performance with a relatively small model and scalable high-resolution capabilities.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

### [189] [IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)
*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPA introduces a feature-aware projection for PEFT to preserve information in the reduced hidden space, improving performance over LoRA/DoRA with similar parameter counts, via PCA-like pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's random down-projection is data-agnostic and discards potentially useful information. Prior analyses show the up-projection carries most adaptation, making the random input compression a bottleneck. A data-aware projection could preserve information and boost performance without extra cost.

Method: Propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework. In the linear case, instantiate IPA with algorithms that approximate top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Evaluate across language and vision benchmarks.

Result: IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA. On average, +1.5 points in commonsense reasoning and +2.3 points on VTAB-1k. When the projection is frozen, IPA matches full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters.

Conclusion: IPA is effective and efficient for PEFT, preserving information in the reduced space, reducing adaptation cost, and delivering improved or matched accuracy across modalities.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised framework, HCL, jointly infers latent causal clusters and their heterogeneous causal structures from mixed-type observational data without requiring temporal order or interventions, with identifiability guarantees and strong empirical performance in single-cell perturbation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of causal awareness in current methods, which struggle with modeling causal heterogeneity, confounding, and observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and confounded heterogeneity; there is a need to reliably discover mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Method: Propose HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), an unsupervised framework that: (i) relaxes homogeneity and sufficiency with an equivalent representation encoding structural heterogeneity and confounding; (ii) uses a bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and structure learning; (iii) employs self-supervised regularization to balance cross-cluster universality and specificity; (iv) operates without temporal ordering, environment labels, or interventions; (v) proves identifiability under mild conditions.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance in both clustering and structure-learning tasks and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Conclusion: HCL enables interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns by jointly clustering samples and learning heterogeneous causal structures, providing identifiability guarantees and practical utility for biology and medicine.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified policy-gradient framework shows RL and SFT data-driven post-training are instances of a single optimization; introduces Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) that dynamically blends training signals using a four-part gradient estimator; theory and experiments show gains on math reasoning and OOD benchmarks across model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training data come from two sources—online (model-generated rollouts) and offline (human or other-model demonstrations). Traditionally RL and SFT treat them separately; this work proposes a single optimization perspective and aims to leverage both data types effectively.

Method: Derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator and express the gradient as four interchangeable components: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) that dynamically selects among training signals based on data distribution and bias-variance considerations. Support with extensive experiments and ablations across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, evaluating models of varying scales and families.

Result: HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across diverse models and tasks, indicating effective exploitation of demonstrations with stable exploration and improved reasoning patterns. The theoretical framework is validated by empirical gains and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unifying view in which RL and SFT are special cases of a single optimization, and offers HPT as a practical algorithm to combine data sources for robust post-training, yielding improved reasoning performance across model scales and families.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

TL;DR: Reframe ESNs as principled state-space models with stability guarantees, local linearizations, and kernel-like analyses, plus Kalman-based readouts and EM-driven hyperparameter learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a principled, systems-theoretic foundation for echo-state networks by linking reservoir computing to classical state-space identification and kernel methods, enabling interpretable memory, verifiable stability, and principled design.

Method: 1) Show the echo-state property as input-to-state stability for contractive nonlinear SSMs with verifiable conditions using leak, spectral scaling, and Lipschitz constants. 2) Develop two mappings: (i) small-signal linearizations yielding locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and memory horizons; (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that make the ESN linear in an augmented state, permitting transfer-function and convolutional-kernel analyses. 3) Cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, plus EM for hyperparameters (leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

Result: The approach yields frequency-domain characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured SSM kernels, connecting reservoir computing with classical identification and kernel methods.

Conclusion: Presents a unified, principled framework for ESNs as state-space models, enabling principled design, analysis, and learning (via Kalman-based readouts and EM) that ties together stability, memory, and kernel perspectives.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

*Nikolay Kartashev,Ivan Rubachev,Artem Babenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data uncertainty is the key factor behind the success of modern tabular DL methods. By analyzing how numerical embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, and ensembling manage high data uncertainty, the work provides a unifying theoretical perspective and translates it into improved numerical feature embeddings and practical research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between strong empirical performance of tabular DL and a clear understanding of why it works. Identifying data uncertainty as a central driver aims to bridge theory and practice and guide design choices.

Method: The authors dissect the mechanisms by which popular tabular DL techniques handle data uncertainty, proposing a unifying perspective that ties together numerical feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, and ensembling. They use this lens to analyze and reinterpret existing methods and to derive improved numerical feature embeddings as a practical outcome.

Result: A unifying understanding of why tabular DL works, a demonstration that diverse design choices can be explained through data uncertainty, and the development of more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical benefit, along with a framework for future research directions.

Conclusion: The work provides foundational insight into the benefits of modern tabular methods, enabling concrete advancements in techniques and guiding future research in tabular deep learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta Activations offers a vector-embedding representation for finetuned LLMs by tracking shifts in internal activations from a base model. This embedding supports clustering by domain/task, shows robustness to finetuning variations, exhibits additivity when combining datasets, and can encode tasks via few-shot finetuning. It enables better model navigation, selection, and merging in open-source model ecosystems.


<details>

Motivation: The rapid proliferation of post-trained/open-source LLMs creates a fragmented landscape with inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories, making it hard to discover, compare, and reuse models.

Method: Compute delta activations: represent each finetuned model as a vector of activation shifts relative to a common base model; use these embeddings to cluster models by domain and task; verify robustness across different finetuning settings; demonstrate additive properties when mixing finetuning datasets; embed tasks via few-shot finetuning; explore applications in model selection and merging; provide code for reuse.

Result: Delta Activations yields meaningful clustering by domain and task, is robust across finetuning variations, and shows additivity when finetuning datasets are mixed; can embed tasks with few-shot finetuning; demonstrates utility for model selection and merging; code available.

Conclusion: Delta Activations provides a practical, robust representation for post-trained models that can improve navigation, discovery, and reuse in open-source model ecosystems by enabling clustering, task embedding, and model merging based on activation shifts.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes cognitively faithful pairwise decision models, learning from pairwise comparisons to align AI with human decision heuristics; demonstrates on kidney allocation with interpretable features and fixed aggregation like Bradley-Terry, achieving accuracy comparable or better than prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models used in preference elicitation fail to capture human cognitive processes (heuristics), hindering generalization. The authors propose axiomatic, cognitively faithful models to better reflect how people compare options and make decisions.

Method: Define a class of models where each feature is processed and compared across alternatives; aggregated by a fixed rule (e.g., Bradley-Terry). Learn from pairwise comparisons; applied to kidney allocation task; show interpretability and accuracy.

Result: The proposed models match or surpass the accuracy of prior models for human pairwise decision-making; demonstrate efficacy in kidney allocation task; provide interpretable representations of decision rules.

Conclusion: Cognitively faithful, axiomatic modeling improves alignment with human decision processes, enabling better generalization across tasks and providing interpretable, testable representations of decision behavior.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

### [196] [ChronoGraph: A Real-World Graph-Based Multivariate Time Series Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04449)
*Adrian Catalin Lutu,Ioana Pintilie,Elena Burceanu,Andrei Manolache*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph-structured, real-world microservice time-series dataset with per-service multivariate metrics, a dependency graph, and real-incident anomaly labels, enabling structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware anomaly evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks that combine multivariate time series, explicit graph structure, and incident-aligned anomalies in microservice environments, enabling realistic forecasting and robustness testing.

Method: Construct ChronoGraph from production microservices: each node is a service emitting CPU, memory, network metrics; directed edges capture dependencies; expert-annotated incident windows provide anomaly labels; baseline experiments include various forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors.

Result: Baseline results across forecasting and anomaly-detection methods demonstrating feasibility and benchmarking utility; specific metrics not stated in the abstract.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems, enabling evaluation of forecast robustness during operational disruptions.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.
