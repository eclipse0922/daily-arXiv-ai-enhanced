### [1] [Milestone Determination for Autonomous Railway Operation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06229)
*Josh Hunter,John McDermid,Simon Burton,Poppy Fynes,Mia Dempster*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Route-focused milestone-based dataset and rule-based vision models for railway automation to cope with scarce sequential data and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential datasets for railway vision are scarce and lack essential spatio-temporal context, hindering real-time decision-making. Alternatives risk realism or applicability. A route-specific, cue-driven approach aims to align data with real operational logic.

Method: Generate route-specific sequential datasets emphasizing context-relevant cues; identify milestones (critical decision points) along routes and develop targeted, rule-based models that simplify learning by avoiding generalized dynamic component recognition; train in controlled, predictable environments to enhance safety and reliability.

Result: Conceptual framework with anticipated benefits rather than empirical results; claims improved data efficiency, decision accuracy, safety, and transferability to real-world routes.

Conclusion: The proposed milestone-based, route-aware framework offers a practical path for training vision agents in controlled environments, potentially enabling safer and more efficient railway-automation ML systems.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

### [2] [CML-Bench: A Framework for Evaluating and Enhancing LLM-Powered Movie Scripts Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06231)
*Mingzhe Zheng,Dingjie Song,Guanyu Zhou,Jun You,Jiahao Zhan,Xuran Ma,Xinyuan Song,Ser-Nam Lim,Qifeng Chen,Harry Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CML-Bench to assess movie-script quality; builds CML-Dataset; shows CML-Instruction improves LLM script quality per DC, CC, PR metrics aligned with human prefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at producing structured text but struggle with cinematic 'soul'—nuanced storytelling and emotional depth—so a dataset and benchmark are needed to quantify narrative quality in scripts.

Method: Construct CML-Dataset from high-quality movie scripts as (summary, content) pairs; analyze multi-shot continuity and narrative structure; define three quality dimensions (Dialogue Coherence, Character Consistency, Plot Reasonableness); develop CML-Bench metrics; create CML-Instruction prompting strategy to guide LLMs in dialogue and event logic.

Result: CML-Bench scores align with human preferences; human-written scripts score higher; LLMs reveal weaknesses without guidance; LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality scripts.

Conclusion: CML-Bench is effective for evaluating cinematic-script quality; CML-Instruction improves LLM-generated scripts; provides a resource and pathway for better, more cinema-like AI storytelling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

### [3] [User to Video: A Model for Spammer Detection Inspired by Video Classification Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06233)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Yucai Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UVSD converts user behavior into video frames (via user2pixel and behavior2image) and uses video classification to detect spammers, outperforming state-of-the-art on WEIBO and TWITTER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spammer detection often relies on static or hand-crafted features; modeling user behavior as temporal videos may capture richer dynamics and adversarial patterns.

Method: 1) user2pixel maps user stance into an RGB pixel; 2) behavior2image transforms behavior subspace into frame images using low-rank representation learning plus cutting and diffusion to complete frames; 3) construct user behavior videos from temporal features; 4) apply video classification to identify spammers.

Result: Experimentally, UVSD demonstrates an advantage over state-of-the-art methods on public datasets WEIBO and TWITTER.

Conclusion: Videoization of user behavior is a promising direction for spammer detection, integrating pixel-based representation, imageification of behavior subspaces, and video-classification techniques; results on WEIBO and TWITTER validate the approach but lack detailed metrics.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

### [4] [Uncertainty Quantification In Surface Landmines and UXO Classification Using MC Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06238)
*Sagar Lekhak,Emmett J. Ientilucci,Dimah Dera,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monte Carlo Dropout on a fine-tuned ResNet-50 to quantify epistemic uncertainty for surface landmine and UXO classification, showing reliability signals under noise and adversarial perturbations on simulated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deminings rely on DL but deterministic models are brittle under noise/adversarial threats; uncertainty quantification can improve safety and decision-making.

Method: Fine-tuned ResNet-50 with MC-Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty; tested on a simulated dataset with clean, adversarially perturbed, and noisy test images.

Result: MC-Dropout provides uncertainty estimates that flag unreliable predictions; demonstrates potential to reduce missed detections and misclassifications under challenging conditions; proof-of-concept.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is essential in demining; need for more robust models; the approach highlights vulnerabilities and informs development of reliable models.

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

### [5] [multimodars: A Rust-powered toolkit for multi-modality cardiac image fusion and registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06241)
*Anselm W. Stark,Marc Ilic,Ali Mokhtari,Pooya Mohammadi Kazaj,Christoph Graeni,Isaac Shiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: multimodars is an open, high-performance toolkit for deterministic fusion of intravascular imaging (IVUS) and CCTA to enable multi-state 3D coronary modeling, featuring a NumPy-centric data model and a Rust backend.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for an open, flexible, deterministic, and scalable tool to fuse high-resolution intravascular data with whole-vessel 3D context from CCTA across multiple clinical states (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) to enable reliable coronary analyses.

Method: Develop a deterministic alignment pipeline, a compact NumPy-centered data model, and an optimized Rust backend; support CSV/NumPy inputs and data formats from AIVUS-CAA, enabling reproducible experiments and easy pipeline integration.

Result: Introduction of multimodars, a toolkit that provides deterministic alignment, a NumPy-based data model, and a Rust backend for scalable multimodal fusion of IVUS and CCTA, with input compatibility for standard CSV/NumPy formats including AIVUS-CAA outputs.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap by delivering an open, deterministic, high-performance multimodal fusion toolkit for IVUS-CCTA coronary analysis, enabling multi-state analyses with reproducible workflows.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

### [6] [Does Physics Knowledge Emerge in Frontier Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06251)
*Ieva Bagdonaviciute,Vibhav Vineet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Six frontier Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are benchmarked on three physical-dynamics datasets (CLEVRER, Physion, Physion++) with diagnostic tests separating perception and physics reasoning. Surprisingly, strong performance in either domain does not reliably predict predictive or counterfactual accuracy, revealing a fragmentation between perception and reasoning and a need for architectures that tightly integrate both for causal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether current VLMs can translate perceptual and physics-reasoning abilities into accurate physical predictions and counterfactual reasoning, and to diagnose whether these abilities correlate with broader evaluation performance.

Method: Benchmark six leading VLMs on three physical-simulation datasets. Develop diagnostic subtests that isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion prediction, spatial relations). Compare diagnostic performance to predictive/counterfactual evaluation outcomes.

Result: Weak correlations between diagnostic (perception/physics) performance and predictive/counterfactual accuracy. Models excelling in perception or physics reasoning do not consistently boost predictive or counterfactual tasks. Indicates perceptual and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal understanding.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack tight integration between perception and reasoning needed for true causal understanding of physical dynamics; architecture designs should focus on binding perceptual and reasoning components more tightly to enable robust prediction and counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

### [7] [Enhanced Self-Distillation Framework for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06254)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Chengting Yu,Kairong Yu,Lei Liu,Aili Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced self-distillation framework for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with rate-based backpropagation, decoupling reliable/unreliable teacher signals to guide learning via lightweight ANN branches. It aims to reduce training complexity under limited resources while maintaining or improving accuracy, validated on CIFAR-10/100, CIF10-DVS, and ImageNet with code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient on neuromorphic hardware, but state-of-the-art training (surrogate gradients, BPTT) is computationally and memory intensive and lags behind ANNs. To enable high-performance SNN training under limited resources, there is a need for methods that lower training complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Self-distillation offers a pathway, but low-quality self-generated knowledge can hinder convergence.

Method: Propose an enhanced self-distillation framework optimized with rate-based backpropagation. The firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto lightweight ANN branches. High-quality knowledge generated by the model guides substructures through the ANN pathways. Crucially, the teacher signal is decoupled into reliable and unreliable components, and only the reliable knowledge is used to guide optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate reduced training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training, validating the effectiveness of the approach across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method addresses the shortcomings of conventional self-distillation in SNN training by filtering the teacher signal into reliable components and leveraging lightweight ANN pathways to transfer knowledge. This yields more stable convergence and lower computational demands, making high-performance SNN training feasible under limited resources. The authors also provide a public code release.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

### [8] [Ensemble Deep Learning and LLM-Assisted Reporting for Automated Skin Lesion Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06260)
*Sher Khan,Raz Muhammad,Adil Hussain,Muhammad Sajjad,Muhammad Rashid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified dermatology AI integrating a heterogeneous CNN ensemble with embedded LLM-driven reporting to improve diagnostic reliability, reduce bias across skin tones, and enhance patient communication and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cutaneous malignancies requires reliable, bias-minimized tools and clear clinician–patient communication. Current AI systems struggle with inter-observer variability, access disparities, and treating NLP as post-hoc rather than integral to decision-making.

Method: (1) A purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse CNNs provides complementary diagnostic perspectives with an intrinsic uncertainty mechanism to flag discordant cases for specialist review. (2) Large language model capabilities are embedded directly into the diagnostic workflow to convert classification outputs into clinically meaningful assessments, generate structured reports, and deliver patient-centered education, including lesion characterization, diagnostic reasoning, and monitoring guidance.

Result: No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the authors claim improved diagnostic precision and seamless integration that supports the care continuum, from detection through patient education.

Conclusion: The framework aims to bridge the translational gap in dermatological AI by delivering a deployable system that enhances diagnostic accuracy while facilitating documentation, reasoning transparency, and patient engagement, potentially improving early intervention rates.

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

### [9] [Vision Transformer for Transient Noise Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06273)
*Divyansh Srivastava,Andrzej Niedzielski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-based classifier on Gravity Spy data, including two O3a noise classes, achieves 92.26% accuracy on 24 classes (22 existing + 2 new) of LIGO glitches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transient glitches hinder gravitational-wave detection; new O3a noise classes require updated models to efficiently classify glitches and improve signal rejection.

Method: Fine-tuned pre-trained Vision Transformer ViT-B/32 on a combined Gravity Spy dataset augmented with two O3a classes.

Result: Classification accuracy/efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating ViT's potential to improve GW detection by better distinguishing transient noise.

Conclusion: Vision Transformer effectively classifies LIGO glitches, accommodating new noise classes and enhancing noise discrimination for GW detection.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.
  Key words: gravitational waves --vision transformer --machine learning

### [10] [General and Efficient Visual Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning using Object-Agnostic Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06277)
*Fahim Shahriar,Cheryl Wang,Alireza Azimi,Gautham Vasan,Hany Hamed Elanwar,A. Rupam Mahmood,Colin Bellinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask-based goal representation for goal-conditioned RL provides dense, object-agnostic cues, improving generalization and sim-to-real transfer without explicit target coordinates, achieving near-perfect reaching accuracy on seen and unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCRL relies on goal representations; traditional representations (images of target state, coordinates, one-hot) generalize poorly to unseen objects, converge slowly, or require special cameras. Mask-based cues can be dense rewards and object-agnostic.

Method: Introduce a mask-based goal representation; process masks to produce dense rewards; train in simulation with ground-truth masks; leverage pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors to generate masks for real robots; evaluate on pick-up tasks; demonstration of sim-to-real with two robots; from scratch learning.

Result: Achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects; high pick-up accuracy without accessing target positional information; successful sim-to-real transfer on two robots.

Conclusion: Mask-based goal representations are effective for GCRL, enabling faster learning, better generalization to unseen objects, and robust sim-to-real transfer; compatible with open-vocabulary detection.

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

### [11] [Improving the Spatial Resolution of GONG Solar Images to GST Quality Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06281)
*Chenyang Li,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAN-based super-resolution of GONG H-alpha images enhances LR full-disk data toward HR BBSO/GST quality, capturing fine structures; but performance limited by small misalignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve fine-scale solar features (filaments, fibrils) not visible in full-disk LR H-alpha images, enabling higher-quality solar observations from existing GONG data.

Method: Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator; supervised training on aligned GONG-GST image pairs; careful alignment of LR-HR pairs; dataset alignment to improve fidelity.

Result: Quantitative metrics: MSE 467.15, RMSE 21.59, CC 0.7794; qualitative improvements in sunspot penumbrae and filaments/fibrils; achieved quality comparable to HR observations; slight misalignments limit performance.

Conclusion: GAN-based SR is effective for upconverting GONG H-alpha images to HR-like quality, with potential for improvement through better alignment and expanded datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

### [12] [ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292)
*Yike Wu,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainMPQ is a training-free method that reduces relation hallucination in LVLMs by using an interleaved chain of image and text memories guided by multi-perspective questions about subjects, objects, and relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relation hallucinations are the dominant but least-addressed type of hallucination in LVLMs. Existing methods often target object/attribute hallucinations or require training data; a memory-guided, training-free approach can improve relational inference reliability.

Method: ChainMPQ extracts subject/object keywords from the question to highlight relevant image regions, then generates multi-perspective questions centered on the subject, object, and the relation. These questions are asked sequentially, with textual and visual memories from prior steps feeding contextual support for later ones, forming an interleaved chain of images and text to guide progressive relational reasoning.

Result: The approach substantially reduces relation hallucinations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its three core modules (keyword-based region enhancement, multi-perspective questioning, and interleaved memory-based reasoning).

Conclusion: A training-free, memory-guided questioning framework can improve relational inference in LVLMs by structuring progressive, multi-perspective reasoning, thereby mitigating relation hallucinations across models and benchmarks.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

### [13] [Efficient High-Resolution Image Editing with Hallucination-Aware Loss and Adaptive Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06295)
*Young D. Kwon,Abhinav Mehrotra,Malcolm Chadwick,Alberto Gil Ramos,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MobilePicasso enables efficient on-device 4K image editing by a three-stage pipeline that edits at standard resolution, projects into latent space, then upscales with adaptive tiling; it achieves large speedups and higher quality with fewer hallucinations compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image editing on mobile devices is constrained by memory and compute; diffusion-based editors are powerful but resource-intensive, so there's a need for efficient on-device solutions that preserve privacy and reduce latency.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (i) edit at standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss; (ii) latent projection to avoid pixel-space operations; (iii) adaptive context-preserving tiling to upscale the edited latent to 4K.

Result: User study (n=46) shows quality improvements of 18-48% and hallucination reductions of 14-51% over existing methods; up to 55.8x latency speed-up with 9% extra memory; on-device runtime faster than a server-based A100 model.

Conclusion: MobilePicasso demonstrates that efficient, high-quality on-device 4K image editing is feasible, achieving substantial speedups and memory efficiency while reducing hallucinations relative to prior approaches.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

### [14] [RGBD Gaze Tracking Using Transformer for Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06298)
*Tobias J. Bauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RGBD gaze tracking with Transformer-based feature fusion; introduces a new RGBD gaze dataset and evaluates several configurations; removing GAN-based depth artifact removal and using an MLP improves mean Euclidean error; angular errors vary across datasets; overall demonstrates potential of RGBD+fusion but not uniformly superior across metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of single-modality gaze estimation and the scarcity of RGBD gaze datasets; explore whether Transformer-based fusion of RGB and depth improves gaze angle/point estimation, building on prior GAN-based depth processing (Lian et al.).

Method: Create a new RGBD dataset with suitable gaze-angle labels; implement an architecture inspired by Lian et al. that uses a GAN to remove depth artifacts and extract head-pose features, and compare it to Transformer-based feature fusion (with and without GAN) and an MLP; evaluate on three datasets (ShanghaiTechGaze+, ETH-XGaze, OTH-Gaze-Estimation) using mean Euclidean error (for gaze point) and mean angular error (for gaze direction).

Result: On ShanghaiTechGaze+: Transformer with GAN shows 55.3mm mean Euclidean error; removing the GAN leads to 30.1mm; replacing Transformer with an MLP yields 26.9mm. On ETH-XGaze: Transformer yields 3.59° mean angular error; without Transformer 3.26°; Zhang et al.'s method achieves 2.04°. Results on the third dataset are not fully detailed in the abstract, but the trends are consistent across datasets.

Conclusion: The RGBD+Transformer approach is viable but not universally superior; removing GAN pretraining and using a simpler fusion (MLP) can yield better accuracy in some settings. Dataset creation is a key contribution, enabling RGBD gaze estimation research. The work suggests promise for real-time gaze estimation pipelines and points to future work in refining fusion strategies and expanding datasets.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

### [15] [Scalable deep fusion of spaceborne lidar and synthetic aperture radar for global forest structural complexity mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06299)
*Tiago de Conto,John Armston,Ralph Dubayah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable deep-learning framework fusing GEDI lidar footprints with multimodal SAR to produce global, high-resolution (25 m) maps of forest structural complexity; achieves R² ≈ 0.82 with a compact model; enables multi-temporal global mapping (2015–2022) and transfer learning to additional variables; supports continuous monitoring with calibrated uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEDI provides sparse, global lidar samples, limiting dense mapping of forest structural complexity. There is a need for wall-to-wall, high-resolution, multi-temporal maps to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management in a changing climate.

Method: Adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture trained on >130 million GEDI footprints and fused with multimodal SAR datasets to produce wall-to-wall 25 m maps of forest structural complexity. The model is lightweight (≈400k parameters) and includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. A global multi-temporal dataset (2015–2022) is generated, demonstrating transfer learning capability to predict additional forest structural variables with low extra computation.

Result: Global R² ≈ 0.82 with under 400k parameters; accurate predictions across biomes and time, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns; enabled generation of a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural complexity from 2015 to 2022.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and accessible without specialized computing infrastructure, and can be extended via transfer learning to additional forest structural variables, supporting continuous, multi-temporal monitoring for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management under climate change.

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

### [17] [TransFIRA: Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06353)
*Allen Tu,Kartik Narayan,Joshua Gleason,Jennifer Xu,Matthew Meyn,Tom Goldstein,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFIRA is a geometry-driven, annotation-free face image recognizability assessment framework that grounds recognizability in embedding space via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), enabling encoder-aligned filtering/weighting and extending to body recognition with explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition in unconstrained environments suffers from extreme variation and unreliable visual quality metrics; existing FIQA methods rely on heuristics, annotations, or heavy generative systems and do not align with the encoder's decision geometry. A lightweight, annotation-free approach that grounds recognizability in embedding space would improve reliability and interpretability across modalities.

Method: Define recognizability through CCS and CCAS, creating a natural, decision-boundary–aligned criterion for filtering and weighting inputs. Develop a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that achieves state-of-the-art verification on BRIAR and IJB-C without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training. Extend the framework to encoder-grounded explainability and to recognizability-aware body recognition, enabling cross-modal applicability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on face benchmarks BRIAR and IJB-C and markedly higher correlation with true recognizability (approaching double), without external labels or backbone-specific training; demonstrates encoder-grounded explainability and successful extension to body recognition with robust cross-dataset performance.

Conclusion: TransFIRA provides a unified, geometry-driven FIQA framework that is encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities, advancing recognizability assessment in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,
and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,
illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

*Carly Sutter,Kara J. Sulia,Nick P. Bassill,Christopher D. Wirz,Christopher D. Thorncroft,Jay C. Rothenberger,Vanessa Przybylo,Mariana G. Cains,Jacob Radford,David Aaron Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNNs and random forests classify NY state road conditions from camera images and weather data, achieving 81.5% accuracy on unseen cameras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce labor-intensive manual road condition assessment to support winter-weather decisions.

Method: Supervised learning on ~22k hand-labeled images; six classes: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, obstructed; CNNs + random forests; incorporate weather data; evaluate on completely unseen cameras to test generalizability.

Result: 81.5% accuracy on unseen cameras; suggests good generalization to new cameras.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of automated road-condition monitoring; potential operational benefits; limitations include labeling cost, dataset size, lack of per-class metrics; future work could improve generalization, robustness, temporal modeling, and deployment considerations.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

*Piyush Dashpute,Niki Nezakati,Wolfgang Heidrich,Vishwanath Saragadam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch-based diffusion model (TDiff) trained on small thermal patches denoises, upscales, and deburrs thermal images by patch-wise diffusion and smooth blending, claimed to be the first learned-prior, multi-task thermal restoration framework; shows strong results on simulated and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal imaging suffers from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and localized degradations, with limited diverse datasets. A patch-based, learned prior aims to leverage local distortions and enable a unified restoration pipeline across tasks.

Method: Train a diffusion model on small thermal patches to learn a prior. Restore full-resolution images by denoising overlapping patches and blending with smooth spatial windowing to avoid seams, enabling denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring within a single framework.

Result: Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring show strong performance on both simulated and real thermal data, supporting the approach as a unified restoration pipeline.

Conclusion: This work presents the first patch-based diffusion framework for thermal restoration across multiple tasks, offering a unified, learned-prior approach to improve thermal image quality.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed
pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal
imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIGMA-GEN is a unified, single-pass framework for multi-identity image generation that supports multi-level user guidance (from coarse boxes to pixel-level masks) and achieves strong identity preservation and speed using a new synthetic dataset SIGMA-SET27K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior multi-identity generation methods by enabling single-pass generation with flexible, multi-granularity guidance and by providing a large synthetic dataset with identity, structure, and spatial information.

Method: Proposes SIGMA-GEN, a unified model that handles multi-subject identity-preserved generation with guidance at varying precision levels (2D/3D boxes, segmentation, depth) using a single architecture. Introduces SIGMA-SET27K—a synthetic dataset with identity, structure, and spatial cues for over 100k subjects across 27k images.

Result: Empirical evaluation reports state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, generation quality, and speed.

Conclusion: SIGMA-GEN enables flexible, efficient multi-identity image generation with broad guidance options; the accompanying SIGMA-SET27K dataset supports training and evaluation, with code and visualizations available online.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image
generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable
single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both
structural and spatial constraints. A key strength of our method is its ability
to support user guidance at various levels of precision -- from coarse 2D or 3D
boxes to pixel-level segmentations and depth -- with a single model. To enable
this, we introduce SIGMA-SET27K, a novel synthetic dataset that provides
identity, structure, and spatial information for over 100k unique subjects
across 27k images. Through extensive evaluation we demonstrate that SIGMA-GEN
achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation, image
generation quality, and speed. Code and visualizations at

### [21] [Superpixel Integrated Grids for Fast Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06487)
*Jack Roberts,Jeova Farias Sales Rocha Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SIGRID, a superpixel-based grid that compresses input for segmentation, achieving comparable or better accuracy than pixel-level representations with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DL segmentation often struggles with irregular superpixel distributions and high input dimensionality. A compact, information-rich representation that preserves color and shape could improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Proposes SIGRID, a Superpixel-Integrated Grid that encodes color and shape information of superpixels using classic shape descriptors. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets with two popular convolutional segmentation architectures.

Result: SIGRID matches or surpasses pixel-level segmentation performance while significantly accelerating training and reducing input size.

Conclusion: SIGRID demonstrates a favorable accuracy–efficiency trade-off and shows that superpixel-based grids can be viable alternatives to full-resolution images for segmentation.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more
efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational
potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning
approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures,
undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we
introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated
Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By
leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text2Interact introduces a text-conditioned two-person interaction synthesis framework combining InterCompose and InterActor to generate diverse, text-aligned human-human interactions with high spatiotemporal fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key bottlenecks in modeling human-human interactions: limited two-person training data and insufficiently fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, which collapses rich prompts into a single sentence embedding.

Method: InterCompose: a synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction descriptions with single-person motion priors by retrieving candidate motions, training a conditional reaction generator, and using a neural motion evaluator to filter samples. InterActor: a text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and utilizes an adaptive interaction loss to emphasize contextually relevant inter-person joint pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments show gains in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution scenarios and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable data synthesis and text-aligned two-person interaction modeling with improved coupling and physical plausibility, and code/models will be released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

*Shih-Yao Lin,Sibendu Paul,Caren Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeyScore selects informative frames for long videos by fusing captions and visual context, while STACFP generates diversified frame proposals; together they drastically reduce frames and beat 8-frame baselines on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo, enabling efficient, caption-grounded video understanding without explicit summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient video-language understanding of long videos requires reducing redundant frames while preserving semantic and contextual information. Existing approaches struggle to scale with video length and may underutilize multimodal cues from captions and visuals.

Method: KeyScore jointly scores frame importance using semantic similarity (caption–frame alignment), temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, leveraging both textual and visual signals. STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals) creates compact, diverse frame candidates for long-form videos to supplement the scoring process and enable efficient inference.

Result: Achieves up to 99% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperforms standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo across tasks such as retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning.

Conclusion: Multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding without requiring explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

*Avishree Khare,Hideki Okamoto,Bardh Hoxha,Georgios Fainekos,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces STOPs (Scores for TempOral Properties) and LogSTOP to lift local detector scores into temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic; shows significant gains on video/audio query matching and retrieval benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reason about temporal properties over sequences when only frame/segment-level scores are available, enabling queries and retrieval over time (e.g., does a speaker sound happy at some point?).

Method: Define a scoring function LogSTOP that efficiently computes scores for temporal properties expressed in Linear Temporal Logic from noisy local property scores. Applied with detectors like YOLO (objects) and HuBERT (emotions), and grounding models (Grounding DINO, SlowR50).

Result: LogSTOP with YOLO and HuBERT outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and temporal-logic baselines by at least 16% on query matching for objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech. In ranked retrieval tasks over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 yields 19% MAP and 16% recall improvements over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines.

Conclusion: LogSTOP provides an efficient and effective way to score temporal properties over sequences, enabling improved query answering and retrieval in video and audio domains, and is compatible with various local-property detectors.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

*Zhantao Deng,Mériem Er-Rafik,Anna Sushko,Cécile Hébert,Pascal Fua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEMDiff is a diffusion-based 3D reconstruction framework for limited-angle TEM tomography trained on simulated TEM-like data derived from FIB-SEM; it delivers strong reconstructions without ground-truth TEM 3D data and generalizes to real tilts, effective even at very narrow tilt ranges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle electron tomography suffers missing wedge artifacts and obtaining ground-truth 3D TEM data is challenging; we need a way to learn plausible 3D priors without clean TEM ground truth.

Method: A 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction trained on volumetric FIB-SEM data mapped to TEM tilt series via a simulator; operates directly on 3D volumes to enforce inter-slice consistency, avoiding extra regularization.

Result: On simulated limited-angle datasets, TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods; generalizes to real TEM tilts; reconstructs accurate structures from tilts as small as 8° with 2° increments without retraining.

Conclusion: TEMDiff offers a practical, data-efficient approach to missing-wedge mitigation by learning realistic 3D priors from readily available data and applying them to limited-angle TEM reconstructions with strong generalization.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

*Xiangyi Chen,Théophane Vallaeys,Maha Elbayad,John Nguyen,Jakob Verbeek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VUGEN is a VLM-driven image generation framework that compresses the VLM's vision latent space to a lower-dimensional distribution, enables the VLM to sample within it, and uses a pixel diffusion decoder to map latents to images, achieving superior COCO generation metrics while preserving the VLM's understanding, without relying on VAEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the misalignment and architectural complexity in prior generation approaches that rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or bridging modules, by leveraging pretrained visual priors in VLMs for efficient, high-quality image generation with a simpler pipeline.

Method: Transform the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's vision encoder into a lower-dimensional distribution that preserves visual information; train the VLM to sample within this reduced space; use a dedicated pixel diffusion decoder (VAE-free) to map generated latents to images; compare against latent diffusion decoders that rely on VAE latents; evaluate on COCO with DPG Bench and FID.

Result: DPG Bench improves from 71.17 to 74.32; FID improves from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO; the approach preserves the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: VUGEN demonstrates that leveraging VLM visual priors with a reduced latent space and a direct pixel decoder yields high-quality images and better metrics while maintaining cross-modal understanding, challenging autoencoder-based architectures and offering a simpler, effective generation pipeline.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

### [27] [Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06541)
*Nicholas M. Kroeger,Vincent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-hoc interpretability method, 'cluster paths', clusters activations across layers to produce a sequence of cluster IDs per input; introduces four fidelity/consistency metrics; demonstrates fault-dinding and faithful explanations on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, scales to ViT and uses LLM-derived concept paths, and acts as an OOD detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address opacity, biases, and failure modes in deep vision models by providing human-readable, scalable explanations and reliable indicators of distribution shifts.

Method: Cluster activations at selected layers to form an input sequence of cluster IDs (cluster paths). Define four metrics: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement. Evaluate on spurious-cue CIFAR-10 and five-class CelebA hair-color; extend to Vision Transformer with concept paths via prompting an LLM on minimal path divergences; show cluster paths serve as an effective OOD detector.

Result: In CIFAR-10 spurious-cue experiments, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when cues are removed. On CelebA hair-color, achieve 90% faithfulness and 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without accuracy loss. Scales to ViT with concept paths; visual concepts like color palettes/textures emerge at multiple depths. OOD detection reliably flags anomalous samples before over-confident predictions.

Conclusion: Cluster paths reveal visual concepts across network depths, scale to large vision models, and provide concise, human-readable explanations and effective OOD detection.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

### [28] [HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06564)
*Qiongyang Hu,Wenyang Liu,Wenbin Zou,Yuejiao Su,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HSNet, a heterogeneous subgraph network for image super-resolution, decomposing graphs into complementary subgraphs and aggregating them for accurate yet efficient reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs and attention-based SR methods lack flexible structural adaptability; graph-based approaches offer representation power but incur high computational costs. There is a need for scalable, graph-based SR that balances accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Introduce Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) to generate a diverse set of complementary subgraphs; Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) to adaptively fuse multi-graph features; Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) to keep salient features and reduce computation; assemble into HSNet for end-to-end SR.

Result: HSNet achieves state-of-the-art or competitive SR performance while improving computational efficiency; extensive experiments validate the approach; plan to release code.

Conclusion: Decomposing a global graph into heterogeneous subgraphs and aggregating their representations yields a flexible, efficient graph-based SR framework that balances quality and speed.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

*Fei Zhang,Rob Chancia,Josie Clapp,Amirhossein Hassanzadeh,Dimah Dera,Richard MacKenzie,Jan van Aardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-automated, uncertainty-aware TLS segmentation pipeline using spherical projection, feature enrichment, and ensemble learning to reduce labeling effort; introduces Mangrove3D and shows data efficiency and feature importance with mIoU ~0.76 after ~12 annotated scans, with geometric features and compact nine-channel stacks being most effective, and demonstrates cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is hampered by the high cost of manual annotation. The work seeks scalable, high-accuracy labeling through a semi-automated, uncertainty-guided workflow that reduces labeling effort while maintaining performance.

Method: Project 3D TLS points to a 2D spherical grid, enrich 2D pixels with multi-source features, train an ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, guide targeted annotation with uncertainty, back-project 2D predictions to 3D, and provide a three-tier visualization suite. Introduce Mangrove3D dataset and evaluate data efficiency, feature importance, and cross-dataset generalization.

Result: The approach achieves mIoU ~0.76 with around 12 annotated scans, indicating data efficiency; geometric features contribute the most to performance, and a compact nine-channel feature stack captures nearly all discriminative power; the method generalizes to ForestSemantic and Semantic3D datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware TLS annotation pipeline delivers scalable, high-quality segmentation, publishes Mangrove3D for ecological monitoring, and provides empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance to inform future TLS segmentation efforts.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

### [30] [Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06584)
*Justin Cheung,Samuel Savine,Calvin Nguyen,Lin Lu,Alhassan S. Yasin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-adversarial neural networks adapt to unseen CT ring artifacts without labeled data, achieving ring-artifact accuracy comparable to fully supervised artifact-trained models and unexpectedly generalizing to uniform noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning classifiers degrade when faced with distribution shifts (new imaging artifacts). Labeling new artifact data is costly; domain adaptation offers a way to maintain performance without new labels in medical imaging.

Method: Simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Compare domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baselines (training on clean data) and augmentation-based approaches. Train using unlabeled artifact data and evaluate on ring artifact test data; assess generalization to other distortions like uniform noise.

Result: Baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to ring artifacts. Traditional augmentation with other distortions provides little to no improvement on unseen artifact domains. DANN maintains high accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, comparable to models trained with labeled artifact images, and unexpectedly generalizes to uniform noise.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation is a viable approach to address distribution shift due to artifacts in medical imaging without expensive labeling of new artifact distributions. This has potential for clinical deployment where novel artifacts may emerge, though further validation on real-world data is warranted.

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

### [31] [Ming-UniVision: Joint Image Understanding and Generation with a Unified Continuous Tokenizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06590)
*Ziyuan Huang,DanDan Zheng,Cheng Zou,Rui Liu,Xiaolong Wang,Kaixiang Ji,Weilong Chai,Jianxin Sun,Libin Wang,Yongjie Lv,Taozhi Huang,Jiajia Liu,Qingpei Guo,Ming Yang,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MingTok presents a continuous latent-space visual tokenizer and a three-stage encoding pipeline (low-level encoding, semantic expansion, visual reconstruction) to unify visual understanding and generation under a single autoregressive, next-token prediction framework, enabling multi-round in-context tasks and achieving state-of-the-art results in both domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete latent tokenizers introduce quantization errors that limit semantic expressiveness and hinder vision-language understanding. A continuous latent space can better reconcile generation (compact codes) and understanding (high-dimensional discriminative features) and unify tasks.

Method: A three-stage architecture for visuals: (1) low-level encoding, (2) semantic expansion, (3) visual reconstruction. Built atop MingTok, Ming-UniVision unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm in a shared continuous space, enabling iterative understanding, generation, and editing.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art performance across both visual understanding and generation. Demonstrates multi-round, in-context capabilities. Inference code and model weights are released for community use.

Conclusion: Continuous, unified visual tokenization can reconcile the conflicting requirements of understanding and generation, enabling a single autoregressive framework for diverse vision-language tasks and multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

### [32] [HARP-NeXt: High-Speed and Accurate Range-Point Fusion Network for 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06876)
*Samir Abou Haidar,Alexandre Chariot,Mehdi Darouich,Cyril Joly,Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARP-NeXt is a fast and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation network designed for embedded systems. It minimizes preprocessing overhead, uses a Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block, and a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone to preserve geometric details, achieving superior speed-accuracy without test-time augmentation and matching top methods like PTv3 while running ~24x faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR semantic segmentation needs real-time inference on resource-constrained embedded devices. State-of-the-art methods sacrifice either accuracy or speed: point-based and sparse conv approaches are accurate but slow due to neighbor search and 3D convolutions; projection-based methods are fast but lose geometric information; many approaches rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) that further slows inference; preprocessing adds overhead on embedded platforms.

Method: Introduce a novel preprocessing pipeline to significantly reduce computational overhead; design the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to capture representations efficiently without deep stacking per network stage; adopt a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that aggregates information at multiple abstraction levels to preserve geometric details and improve accuracy.

Result: On nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to state-of-the-art methods. Without ensemble models or TTA, it is comparable to the top-ranked PTv3 while running 24× faster. The authors provide code at the listed GitHub repository.

Conclusion: HARP-NeXt delivers high-speed and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation suitable for embedded platforms, mitigating preprocessing and TTA overhead while maintaining competitive or superior performance.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

*Tianyue Xu,Yanlin Wu,Abhai K. Tripathi,Matthew M. Ippolito,Benjamin D. Haeffele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trainable color normalization approach for pathology images using a Beer-Lambert law-inspired, unrolled nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract stain-invariant structure, improving cross-domain performance for object detection and classification without fixed template normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color variability from staining protocols and imaging conditions causes domain shift that degrades DL performance; existing normalization methods often introduce artifacts or rely on template images, limiting robustness and generalizability.

Method: A neural architecture derived by unrolling a nonnegative matrix factorization model under the Beer-Lambert physics of imaging to extract stain-invariant structural information, which is then fed into a downstream network (backbone) for tasks like detection/classification; trainable and integrable with any backbone.

Result: Evaluated on public pathology datasets and an internal malaria blood smear collection for cross-domain object detection and classification; the approach outperforms many state-of-the-art stain normalization methods.

Conclusion: The proposed BeerLaNet-style trainable normalization provides a robust, physics-informed preprocessor that mitigates color domain shift across datasets and is compatible with various downstream backbones, with code available for reuse.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: A new Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM) evaluates synthetic data quality for object detection without requiring model convergence; it correlates strongly with mAP (YOLOv11) and outperforms prior metrics, enabling efficient data generation and selection. Code is available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets hampers robust model performance. Synthetic data from simulations and generative models can boost dataset diversity and model reliability, but evaluating synthetic data quality remains costly and tied to full model training.

Method: Introduce SDQM, a metric that assesses synthetic data quality for object detection without requiring model training to converge. Validate by correlating SDQM scores with the mAP of YOLOv11 and compare against previous quality metrics.

Result: SDQM shows a strong correlation with YOLOv11 mAP, outperforming existing metrics that showed only moderate or weak correlations. It provides actionable guidance to improve dataset quality and reduces the need for iterative model training. The metric is scalable and efficient, setting a new standard for evaluating synthetic data.

Conclusion: SDQM offers a scalable, efficient standard for assessing synthetic data quality in object detection, enabling better dataset generation/selection under resource constraints. The authors provide code at https://github.com/ayushzenith/SDQM.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

TL;DR: AIM 2025 introduces a Real-World RAW Image Denoising Challenge that uses synthetic data to train models for camera-agnostic denoising in low light, evaluated on a five-camera benchmark with both full-reference (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and no-reference (ARNIQA, TOPIQ) metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between real-world low-light noise and models trained on synthetic data; enable robust, camera-agnostic denoising across diverse cameras; advance practical denoising methods relevant to photography and autonomous driving.

Method: Organize a competitive benchmark built on challenging low-light RAW images from five DSLR cameras; participants develop noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training strategies; winners are determined by combining full-reference and non-reference metrics across camera models.

Result: No empirical results are reported yet; the abstract outlines the competition design and evaluation criteria, with expected impact upon completion.

Conclusion: The competition aims to push robust, camera-agnostic RAW denoising trained on synthetic data and is expected to influence image restoration and night-time autonomous driving, reflecting progress in digital photography.

Abstract: We introduce the AIM 2025 Real-World RAW Image Denoising Challenge, aiming to
advance efficient and effective denoising techniques grounded in data
synthesis. The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation
benchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild
using five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing
novel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training
methodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models.
Winners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including
full-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA,
TOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image
denoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development
of robust and practical models aligned with the rapid progress in digital
photography. We expect the competition outcomes to influence multiple domains,
from image restoration to night-time autonomous driving.

*Jingran Xu,Yuanyuan Liu,Yanjie Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot, scan-specific MRI reconstruction using a physics-guided unrolled network with implicit neural representations (INR) as a regularizer; achieves high acceleration (R=10) and outperforms supervised methods without needing external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is slow; reducing scan time is critical, and fully supervised methods require large, external training datasets. Self-supervised/zero-shot approaches tailor reconstruction to each scan and can improve interpretability.

Method: A physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction framework that integrates Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to constrain the solution space. The model is trained in a zero-shot, scan-specific manner without external training data.

Result: With an acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to supervised learning methods on the tested data.

Conclusion: The combination of a physics-guided unrolled architecture with INR regularization enables effective, interpretable, scan-specific fast MRI reconstruction without external training data, and shows strong performance even at high acceleration.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

*Zibo Su,Kun Wei,Jiahua Li,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuEx introduces a multilingual talking face synthesis framework using a phoneme-guided mixture-of-experts (PG-MoE) with phoneme/viseme intermediaries, a Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), and a new 12-language benchmark (MTFB), achieving strong multilingual performance and zero-shot generalization to unseen languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: English-dominated TFS datasets lead to poor performance on non-English languages due to limited cross-language generalization and dataset bias; there is a need for universal, language-agnostic representations to bridge audio and video.

Method: Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) using phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries between audio and video; Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) to align cross-modal signals; construction of Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) with 12 languages; extraction of audio/video features as phonemes/visemes to reduce linguistic bias; demonstration of zero-shot generalization to unseen languages.

Result: MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in the MTBF and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that bridging linguistic differences with universal phoneme/viseme representations and robust cross-modal alignment can yield robust multilingual TFS and sets a new benchmark (MTFB) for evaluating multilingual audiovisual synthesis.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike
facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English
but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and
rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the
English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits
effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional

### [38] [WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07313)
*Zezhong Qian,Xiaowei Chi,Yuming Li,Shizun Wang,Zhiyuan Qin,Xiaozhu Ju,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage 4D wrist-view world model that generates wrist-view videos from anchor views, using Reconstruction with Spatial Projection Consistency loss and a Generation stage, achieving state-of-the-art spatial consistency and narrowing the anchor--wrist view gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wrist-view data are scarce in large-scale datasets, creating a gap for viewpoint-aware manipulation models. Existing world models rely on wrist-first frames and cannot generate wrist-view videos from anchor views. VGGT-like geometric priors suggest cross-view consistency can address extreme viewpoint shifts; WristWorld aims to synthesize wrist-view videos from anchor views to enable better VLA performance.

Method: Two-stage approach: (i) Reconstruction: extend VGGT with Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation: a video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda shows state-of-the-art wrist-view video generation with superior spatial consistency; WristWorld improves VLA performance, increasing average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor–wrist view gap.

Conclusion: WristWorld is the first 4D world model that can generate wrist-view videos from anchor views, enabling data generation for wrist-view-centric manipulation tasks and significantly reducing the gap between anchor and wrist viewpoints.

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

*Tao Feng,Tingfa Xu,Haolin Qin,Tianhao Li,Shuaihao Han,Xuyang Zou,Zhan Lv,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSITrack is the largest and most diverse multispectral single-object tracking dataset to date (300 videos, 129k frames, 55 categories), showing that multispectral data improves tracking over RGB baselines and enabling future research; publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based trackers struggle under occlusion, object interference, and background similarity. Multispectral imagery provides spectral discriminability to address these issues. Existing multispectral tracking datasets are limited, hindering progress; a large, diverse benchmark is needed.

Method: Construct MSITrack by collecting 300 multispectral videos across 55 object categories (129k frames), with meticulous frame-level annotation and multi-stage verification. Evaluate representative trackers on the dataset to demonstrate that multispectral information yields gains over RGB-only baselines.

Result: Multispectral data significantly improves tracking performance compared with RGB-only baselines on MSITrack, across challenging real-world scenarios; the dataset expands scene diversity and introduces new attributes, evidencing its usefulness for advancing multispectral tracking.

Conclusion: MSITrack is the largest, most diverse multispectral tracking dataset to date, enabling more realistic and challenging evaluation and driving future research in multispectral tracking. The dataset is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges
including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex
backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers.
Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,
enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral
tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack,
the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to
date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging
Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color
and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a
wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The
MSITrack dataset is publicly available at:

### [40] [StaR-KVQA: Structured Reasoning Traces for Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06638)
*Zhihao Wen,Wenkang Wei,Yuan Fang,Xingtong Yu,Hui Zhang,Weicheng Zhu,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StaR-KVQA introduces Structured Reasoning Traces to IK-KVQA, using dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded explanations; trained with structured self-distillation; no external KBs; achieves improvements in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IK-KVQA relies on multimodal LLMs with no external retrieval, but suffers from lack of explicit reasoning supervision, inconsistent justifications, and weak cross-domain generalization.

Method: Constructs offline, trace-grounded reasoning: dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded natural-language explanations; builds a trace-enriched dataset; fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with the traces; inference is a single autoregressive pass without external retrievers, verifiers, or curated KBs.

Result: Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves accuracy and interpretability, achieving up to 11.3 percentage points higher OK-VQA answer accuracy over the strongest baseline and shows robust cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Structured reasoning traces enable transparent, verifiable IK-KVQA reasoning with no external knowledge sources, yielding strong performance gains and better interpretability, with potential applicability to other VQA tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground
entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its
implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

*Yuxi Liu,Yunfeng Ma,Yi Tang,Min Liu,Shuai Jiang,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoNAD automates neural-architecture search for industrial surface defect detection by hybridizing convolutions, transformers, and MLPs, with cross weight sharing and a multi-level feature aggregation module, guided by a latency-aware search to balance accuracy and deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of intraclass variability and interclass similarity in industrial surface defect detection while reducing the need for manual network design and extensive trial-and-error, with a focus on training efficiency and practical deployment.

Method: Jointly search over convolutional, transformer, and MLP blocks; employ cross weight sharing to accelerate supernet training and improve subnet performance; integrate a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) for enhanced multi-scale feature learning; apply a latency-aware prior to steer architecture selection toward efficient models.

Result: Validated on three industrial defect datasets and implemented in a defect imaging/detection platform; reported improvements in detection capability and practical deployment with a plan to release code publicly.

Conclusion: AutoNAD provides a practical automated design framework for SDD that combines diverse architectural primitives with efficient search strategies, aiming to achieve strong accuracy while meeting latency constraints for industrial use.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

*Yongxin Zhu,Jiawei Chen,Yuanzhe Chen,Zhuo Chen,Dongya Jia,Jian Cong,Xiaobin Zhuang,Yuping Wang,Yuxuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Heptapod is an image autoregressive model using causal attention and 2D distribution prediction, avoiding CFG and semantic tokenizers; it unifies autoregressive sequential modeling with holistic self-supervised masked autoencoding, achieving strong ImageNet generation FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink applying language-modeling principles to visual signals, enabling holistic image semantics through generative training without relying on traditional grammar or tokenization.

Method: A causal Transformer with a reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer that performs next 2D distribution prediction: at each timestep it predicts the distribution over the entire 2D image grid, unifying autoregressive sequence modeling with self-supervised masked autoencoding; avoids CFG and semantic tokenizers.

Result: On ImageNet generation, Heptapod achieves an FID of 2.70, significantly surpassing previous causal autoregressive approaches.

Conclusion: The work motivates rethinking language-modeling principles for visual data and beyond, suggesting that 2D distribution prediction can capture comprehensive image semantics through generative training.

Abstract: We introduce Heptapod, an image autoregressive model that adheres to the
foundational principles of language modeling. Heptapod employs \textbf{causal
attention}, \textbf{eliminates reliance on CFG}, and \textbf{eschews the trend
of semantic tokenizers}. Our key innovation is \textit{next 2D distribution
prediction}: a causal Transformer with reconstruction-focused visual tokenizer,
learns to predict the distribution over the entire 2D spatial grid of images at
each timestep. This learning objective unifies the sequential modeling of
autoregressive framework with the holistic self-supervised learning of masked
autoencoding, enabling the model to capture comprehensive image semantics via
generative training. On the ImageNet generation benchmark, Heptapod achieves an
FID of $2.70$, significantly outperforming previous causal autoregressive
approaches. We hope our work inspires a principled rethinking of language
modeling on visual signals and beyond.

*Bin Xia,Bohao Peng,Yuechen Zhang,Junjia Huang,Jiyang Liu,Jingyao Li,Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Chengyao Wang,Yitong Wang,Xinglong Wu,Bei Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamOmni2 introduces multimodal instruction-based editing and generation, with a data synthesis pipeline (three steps) and a novel framework (index encoding + position encoding shift) and joint training with a VLM; new benchmarks; strong results; releasing code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of instruction-based editing that depend on language instructions and reference images, and to broaden subject-driven generation beyond concrete objects to abstract concepts, by enabling both text and image instructions and practical multimodal capabilities.

Method: Data synthesis in three steps: (1) feature mixing to create extraction data for abstract and concrete concepts; (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing data using editing and extraction models; (3) applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. Framework innovations include an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme to handle multi-image inputs and avoid pixel confusion, plus joint training with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the generation/editing model.

Result: DreamOmni2 achieves impressive results on the proposed tasks and is accompanied by comprehensive benchmarks; plans to release models and code.

Conclusion: The approach broadens multimodal instruction-based editing and generation to cover both concrete and abstract concepts, supported by data-centric and model-centric innovations, promising stronger practical utility and research impact.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

*Jie Luo,Yuxuan Jiang,Xin Jin,Mingyu Liu,Yihui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal fusion approach for semantic segmentation using light field and LiDAR data, introducing a new dataset and Mlpfseg network with feature completion and depth perception to improve occlusion handling; shows gains over single-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion and limited viewpoint diversity challenge semantic segmentation. Light field and LiDAR offer complementary cues, but modality gaps and limited viewpoint diversity hinder effective fusion.

Method: Present a dataset that integrates light field data and point cloud data. Propose Mlpfseg (multimodal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network) with a feature completion module to bridge density gaps between image pixels and points and a depth perception module to enhance occlusion awareness, enabling simultaneous segmentation of camera images and LiDAR point clouds.

Result: On their dataset, Mlpfseg outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 mIoU and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fusion approach.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that combining light field and LiDAR through feature completion and depth-aware fusion yields robust semantic segmentation under occlusion, introducing both a new dataset and a practical fusion network.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Jipeng Lyu,Jiahua Dong,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCas4D introduces a cascaded optimization framework that exploits hierarchical patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes, enabling faster convergence and competitive results with far fewer training iterations (about 1/20), and showing effectiveness in segmentation, novel-view synthesis, and dense point tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis remains challenging due to the trade-off between accurately capturing deformations and maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: SCas4D is a cascaded optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting. It assumes hierarchical deformations where groups of Gaussians share similar transformations. Deformations are progressively refined from coarse part-level to fine point-level, enabling fast convergence.

Result: SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and yields results comparable to existing methods while requiring only about 1/20 of the training iterations. It also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking.

Conclusion: By exploiting hierarchical Gaussian patterns, SCas4D accelerates dynamic scene optimization and delivers competitive performance across several tasks, indicating a promising direction for efficient persistent dynamic scene modeling.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

*Maria Levchenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an evaluation framework for LLM-based historical OCR, introducing domain-specific metrics and contamination controls, and finds modern multimodal LLMs outperform traditional OCR yet risk over-historicization; post-editing worsens results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital humanities need robust evaluation tools for LLM-driven historical OCR that account for temporal biases and period-specific errors not captured by standard OCR metrics.

Method: Develop Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR); implement contamination control and stability testing protocols; evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs on 18th-century Russian Civil font texts undergoing LLM-based OCR and post-editing.

Result: Gemini and Qwen surpass traditional OCR in accuracy but exhibit over-historicization by inserting archaic characters from wrong periods; post-OCR correction degrades performance; the metrics reveal biases that standard OCR metrics miss across 12 models.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization and offers a framework for contamination control and bias-aware evaluation in LLM-based OCR.

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for
historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks
for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and
period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an
evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination
risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

*Zhiliang Zhu,Tao Zeng,Tao Yang,Guoliang Luo,Jiyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A frequency-aware, state-space deraining model (DeRainMamba) using FASSM and MDPConv to separate rain from details, achieving SOTA PSNR/SSIM with fewer parameters and lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rain streaks are high-frequency artifacts that can be confused with image details. Existing Mamba-based models struggle to capture fine-grained structures and lack frequency-domain awareness, limiting deraining performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes DeRainMamba by integrating a Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) that leverages Fourier transform to separate rain from high-frequency details within a state-space framework, and a Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) that captures anisotropic gradient features and fuses multiple convolution branches for better local structure restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks show DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while using fewer parameters and lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Combining frequency-domain modeling with spatial detail enhancement in a state-space framework is effective for single-image deraining, enabling better rain removal with preserved details and efficient computation.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

### [48] [OBS-Diff: Accurate Pruning For Diffusion Models in One-Shot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06751)
*Junhan Zhu,Hesong Wang,Mingluo Su,Zefang Wang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: One-shot OBS-based pruning for large diffusion models (OBS-Diff) enabling training-free compression with various sparsity patterns, guided by timestep-aware Hessian and group-wise pruning to reduce calibration cost, achieving state-of-the-art speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large diffusion models are computationally heavy and iterative denoising makes one-shot pruning challenging; there is a need for training-free, accurate compression methods that work across complex architectures and timesteps.

Method: Adapt Optimal Brain Surgeon to diffusion architectures, supporting unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured sparsity (including MHA heads and FFN neurons); introduce a timestep-aware Hessian with a logarithmic decrease weighting to reflect policy of error accumulation across timesteps; propose a group-wise sequential pruning strategy to amortize expensive calibration.

Result: Empirical experiments show OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

Conclusion: OBS-Diff enables accurate, training-free compression of large diffusion models across sparsity granularities, mitigating error accumulation and reducing calibration cost while preserving visual quality.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

### [49] [Transforming Noise Distributions with Histogram Matching: Towards a Single Denoiser for All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06757)
*Sheng Fu,Junchao Zhang,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A histogram-based, cycle-consistent framework converts diverse noises into Gaussian noise to enable a single Gaussian denoiser to generalize to out-of-distribution noises, with specialized steps to handle signal-dependent, channel-related, and spatially correlated noise, achieving strong results on synthetic and real-world noises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Gaussian denoisers perform poorly on noise distributions that deviate from Gaussian; real-world noise is diverse and distributionally shifted, causing limited generalization across noise types.

Method: Transform arbitrary noise to a known Gaussian target via histogram matching; establish a mutually reinforcing cycle between noise transformation and denoising to progressively refine the noise approximation; handle specific noise structures with: (1) local histogram matching for signal-dependent noise, (2) intrapatch permutation for channel-related noise, (3) frequency-domain histogram matching with pixel-shuffle down-sampling to break spatial correlation.

Result: The approach enables a single Gaussian denoiser to generalize to a range of out-of-distribution noises, including Poisson, salt-and-pepper, and repeating-pattern noises as well as complex real-world noises; extensive experiments report superior generalization and effectiveness compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed histogram-matching cycle broadens the applicability of Gaussian denoisers to diverse noise types, with the mutual refinement between transformation and denoising enhancing both noise conversion quality and denoising performance.

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

### [50] [A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised framework for high-resolution land-cover classification using MIL with low-resolution labels and PU learning, enabling pixel-level models trained from coarse references; validated on GRSS DFC 2020 with favorable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution land-cover mapping struggles with label quality and availability. Leveraging abundant low-resolution maps as weak supervision can train accurate pixel-level classifiers without exhaustive labeling.

Method: Train pixel-level multi-class classifiers on high-resolution imagery while predicting patch-level labels. Use flexible pooling layers to connect pixel-level semantics to low-resolution patch labels. Reformulate MIL in a multi-class and multi-label setting. Use Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU) to handle weak supervision when patch labels provide limited information. Experimental setup leverages Sentinel-2-like high-res imagery and MODIS-derived low-res maps.

Result: Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the proposed framework is effective and outperforms standard training strategies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that MIL with PU learning can enable high-resolution land-cover mapping using weak low-resolution labels, offering a scalable path to train pixel-level classifiers from coarse references; potential for extension to other datasets and pooling variations.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

### [51] [TTRV: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06783)
*Akshit Singh,Shyam Marjit,Wei Lin,Paul Gavrikov,Serena Yeung-Levy,Hilde Kuehne,Rogerio Feris,Sivan Doveh,James Glass,M. Jehanzeb Mirza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time reinforcement learning method (TTRV) for vision-language models that adapts at inference without labeled data, using GRPO-based rewards tied to the base model's outputs and entropy control. It achieves substantial gains on recognition and VQA, even surpassing GPT-4o on image recognition in some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward signal extraction for RL relies on labeled data and fixed training splits, unlike how humans learn from the environment. The goal is to enable unsupervised, on-the-fly adaptation during inference to improve vision-language understanding.

Method: Extend the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by crafting rewards from the base model's output frequency and by rewarding low entropy in the empirical output distribution, and perform multiple inference runs per test sample to guide adaptation.

Result: Gains of up to 52.4% in object recognition and 29.8% in VQA; average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets. On image recognition, TTRV with InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% and remains competitive on VQA. Even with extreme data constraints (a single unlabeled test example), improvements up to 5.5% are observed in recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Test-time reinforcement learning for vision-language models is viable and can match or exceed strong proprietary models; TTRV reveals useful properties of test-time adaptation and demonstrates robust gains across tasks and data regimes.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

### [52] [Extreme Amodal Face Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06791)
*Changlin Song,Yunzhong Hou,Michael Randall Barnes,Rahul Shome,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image extreme amodal detector for faces using heatmaps and a coarse-to-fine decoder; efficient and competitive with generative baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme amodal detection aims to locate objects outside the visible image. For faces, this supports safety/privacy applications. Prior work relies on video sequences or generative sampling, but a sample-free, single-image approach could be more practical and efficient.

Method: Proposes a heatmap-based extreme amodal detector with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder that predicts out-of-frame regions from the input image without relying on sequences or generative samples.

Result: Establishes strong results for the new task and outperforms less efficient generative approaches.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that extreme amodal detection for faces can be effectively performed on single images with an efficient heatmap-based detector, offering practical benefits over generative or multi-frame approaches.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight Vision-Action Adapter enables foundation-model-based cardiac ultrasound probe guidance; by fine-tuning a small parameter subset, it encodes vision-action sequences to provide real-time recommendations, outperforming existing probe-guidance models. Code to be released after acceptance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortage of skilled sonographers and need for real-time, high-quality image acquisition; leverage large medical foundation models to transfer knowledge to probe guidance; improve accessibility and efficiency.

Method: Propose VA-Adapter: a parameter-efficient adapter that enables image encoder to handle vision-action sequences; integrates sequential reasoning; fine-tunes only a small subset of parameters; uses pre-trained ultrasound foundation models; trained/evaluated on probe guidance task; comparisons to baseline strong probe guidance models.

Result: Experiments show VA-Adapter surpasses strong probe guidance models in guidance performance; demonstrates effectiveness of parameter-efficient transfer of foundation-model knowledge to real-time ultrasound probe adjustment.

Conclusion: VA-Adapter enables efficient adaptation of ultrasound foundation models to probe guidance, potentially improving access to high-quality cardiac ultrasound; code to be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

*Mitchell Keren Taraday,Shahaf Wagner,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDJE is an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them with a lightweight attention-based adapter, enabling fast online multimodal retrieval with minimal storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language joint encoders (e.g., BLIP) bottleneck due to expensive visual feature extraction, hindering scalable deployment for reranking in multimodal retrieval; need fast, scalable vision-language rerankers.

Method: Offline precompute of vision tokens, compress via an attention-based adapter, and perform online inference with a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus text.

Result: Achieves 50k image–text pairs per second; requires ~49 kB of disk storage per image; matches prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval, with reduced storage and online compute.

Conclusion: EDJE enables scalable, high-throughput multimodal retrieval while preserving retrieval performance, addressing the bottleneck of expensive visual feature extraction; implementation and checkpoints to be released publicly.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

### [55] [StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06827)
*Jaeseok Jeong,Junho Kim,Gayoung Lee,Yunjey Choi,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model visual prompting method that reduces content leakage via swapping self-attention and introducing negative visual query guidance (NVQG); improves alignment to text prompts and style control; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual prompting in diffusion models risks content leakage from style prompts into generated images, undermining control over content vs. style.

Method: 1) Extend classifier-free guidance by swapping self-attention; 2) Introduce NVQG with a negative score by simulating content leakage where queries are swapped in self-attention instead of keys/values; provide solutions for using real images as visual style prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple styles and text prompts show reduced content leakage and better fidelity to text prompts compared to existing methods; method is effective and practical.

Conclusion: NVQG with swapped self-attention offers an effective, simple way to control style-content leakage in diffusion-based visual prompting; supports real-image prompts and has publicly available code.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

### [56] [Lattice-allocated Real-time Line Segment Feature Detection and Tracking Using Only an Event-based Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06829)
*Mikihiro Ikura,Arren Glover,Masayoshi Mizuno,Chiara Bartolozzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time stand-alone event-camera pipeline for line segment detection and tracking using a lattice-allocated, velocity-invariant representation, a fitting-score-based detector, and endpoint perturbation-based tracking, outperforming event-only and event-frame baselines on public/ad-hoc datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event-based cameras provide sparse, high-temporal-resolution edge data ideal for line-feature extraction, but existing methods rely on frame cameras or fail under high event rates; there is a need for real-time, standalone line segment detection/tracking directly from high-rate event streams.

Method: Lattice-allocated pipeline comprising (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints; operates entirely on event data without requiring frame input.

Result: Demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy than state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines on ad-hoc and public datasets.

Conclusion: Enables fully stand-alone operation of modern event cameras in real-world settings for robust line segment extraction and tracking.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of
human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to
contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant
data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event
camera operation in real-world settings.

### [57] [Continual Action Quality Assessment via Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06842)
*Kanglei Zhou,Qingyi Pan,Xingxing Zhang,Hubert P. H. Shum,Frederick W. B. Li,Xiaohui Liang,Liyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGR++ enables Continual AQA by balancing full-parameter fine-tuning with a manifold-aligned graph regularization strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results under evolving quality distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Action Quality Assessment faces non-stationary quality distributions in real-world settings, which causes generalization gaps and catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. While full-parameter fine-tuning can learn representations, it risks overfitting and feature-manifold shifts; thus a controlled adaptation strategy is needed for CAQA.

Method: Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++) couples backbone fine-tuning (stabilizing shallow layers while adapting deeper ones) with a two-step feature rectification: (1) a manifold projector that translates historical features into the current representation space, and (2) a graph regularizer that aligns local and global distributions. The authors construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and compare to strong baselines.

Result: MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAQA benchmarks, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MAGR++ provides an effective solution for Continual AQA under evolving distributions, balancing representation learning and regularization to mitigate forgetting, and enabling reliable cross-dataset evaluation. The work includes code release.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

*Hyungrok Jung,Daneul Kim,Seunggyun Lim,Jeany Son,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD) and Estimator for real-time event boundary detection in streaming videos, predicting near-future frames from past frames and using adaptive prediction-error thresholds to identify boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GEBD is offline and processes full frames, but humans perceive events online in real time. There is a need for online, taxonomy-free, real-time boundary detection without future frames.

Method: Introduce Estimator inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) with two components: Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA) predicts future frames based on past frames; Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD) measures prediction error and adaptively adjusts thresholds via statistical tests on past errors to detect subtle transitions.

Result: Estimator outperforms baselines adapted from recent online video models and achieves performance comparable to offline GEBD methods on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed On-GEBD Estimator enables real-time boundary detection with robust handling of subtle, taxonomy-free event changes, narrowing the performance gap between online and offline GEBD.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

*Adrien Dorise,Marjorie Bellizzi,Adrien Girard,Benjamin Francesconi,Stéphane May*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study tests onboard detection using raw remote-sensing data via a simulated raw-like workflow, comparing YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S trained on raw vs L1 data. Raw-data models match L1 at low/medium confidence but struggle with boundary accuracy at high confidence; suggests contouring-oriented architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing onboard processing power motivates running AI directly on satellites. Raw sensor data pose distinct challenges from preprocessed products, and little work has systematically evaluated performance on raw data; this study aims to fill that gap with a controlled, simulated evaluation.

Method: Develop a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery. Train two object detectors (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) on both raw-like and L1 datasets. Evaluate with standard detection metrics and explainability analyses to compare performance and insight into decision-making.

Result: Both models show similar performance at low to medium confidence thresholds when trained on either data type. Models trained on raw data struggle with object boundary localization at high confidence. Explainability analyses indicate differences in feature attribution related to boundaries, highlighting contouring as a potential bottleneck with raw inputs.

Conclusion: Adapting AI architectures with improved contouring/edge-aware methods could enhance object detection on raw remote-sensing images, enabling more effective onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing
directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints
arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

Motivation: Accurate, robust AI-based severity prediction from medical imaging is critical for timely clinical decisions during pneumonia outbreaks and pandemics, and to address dataset imbalance.

Method: A Transformer-based architecture (QCross-Att-PVT) with parallel encoders, a cross-gated attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture multi-scale features; paired with Conditional Online TransMix, a data augmentation strategy generating mixed-label image patches during training to mitigate class imbalance.

Result: The method consistently surpasses several state-of-the-art deep learning models on two benchmark datasets (RALO CXR and Per-COVID-19 CT), highlighting the importance of data augmentation and gated attention for robustness and predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning; source code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can
escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity
prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical
decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel
method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung
infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a
Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated
attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale
features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation
strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image
patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and
Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art
deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data
augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive
accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical

*Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an active learning approach for change detection that uses an invertible graph convnet to generate virtual exemplars and selects the most informative unlabeled samples for labeling, improving label efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on large labeled datasets and address acquisition variability and user subjectivity in change detection.

Method: Active learning loop where a model scores unlabeled samples for importance; virtual exemplars are generated by an invertible graph convolutional network optimized with an adversarial loss to maximize representativity, diversity, and ambiguity, guiding which samples the oracle should label next.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the label-efficient learning model outperforms comparative methods in change detection tasks.

Conclusion: An exemplar-based active learning strategy with invertible graph convnets improves label-efficient change detection by better guiding sample selection across iterations.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

### [62] [IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928)
*Ran Yi,Teng Hu,Zihan Su,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAR2 introduces a semantic-detail dual codebook for hierarchical autoregressive image generation, enabling coarse-to-fine synthesis with semantic and detail tokens, plus progressive attention-guided adaptive CFG for conditional generation, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models often ignore intrinsic visual structure; prior IAR used embedding-similarity reorganization but relied on rigid pre-trained codebooks and hard clustering; a flexible, scalable, hierarchical representation is needed to capture global semantics and local details and improve robustness and conditional alignment.

Method: Propose Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook with a semantic codebook for global semantics and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements, expanding quantization capacity from linear to polynomial; introduce Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction with a Local-Context Enhanced Head; and a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG that dynamically modulates guidance per token based on relevance to the condition and token position.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet, with improved efficiency due to the coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Conclusion: Shows that semantic-detail structured decomposition and adaptive conditioning enable more expressive and efficient autoregressive generation, establishing a new benchmark for conditional image synthesis.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

*Bing Li,Wuqi Wang,Yanan Zhang,Jingzheng Li,Haigen Min,Wei Feng,Xingyu Zhao,Jie Zhang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phy3DAdvGen is a text-to-3D adversarial method to create physically realizable LiDAR-invisible pedestrians, validated in CARLA and real environments; shows vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety risks in autonomous driving and the limitations of existing 3D adversarial attacks which seldom cause complete object disappearance and are hard to realize physically.

Method: Empirical study in CARLA by manipulating topology, connectivity, and intensity of pedestrian models; introduces Physy3DAdvGen that iteratively refines text prompts (verbs, objects, poses) to generate LiDAR-invisible pedestrians; constrains generation to combinations from a pool of 13 real 3D models.

Result: Successfully generates 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments.

Conclusion: Highlights vulnerabilities in safety-critical perception systems and provides a physically realizable adversarial generation framework; underscores the need for robust LiDAR detectors and defensive testing against such text-to-3D adversarial strategies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

### [64] [Generating Surface for Text-to-3D using 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06967)
*Huanning Dong,Fan Li,Ping Kuang,Jianwen Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectGaussian generates 3D surfaces as surfels using 2D Gaussian splatting guided by text prompts, with multi-view normal/texture priors and curvature constraints to enforce geometric consistency, achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D content creation is challenging due to complex natural geometries. Existing approaches rely on 2D diffusion priors for geometry or train on specific 3D representations, limiting fidelity and diversity. This work seeks a surface-centric, yet flexible, 3D generation method.

Method: Represent 3D surfaces with surfels and render them via 2D Gaussian splatting. Use conditional text generation models for prompts, incorporate multi-view normal and texture priors, and enforce curvature constraints during optimization to improve multi-view geometric consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework can produce diverse and high-fidelity 3D content.

Conclusion: DirectGaussian offers a surfel-based, text-to-3D surface generation approach that achieves good diversity and fidelity, with curvature constraints enhancing multi-view consistency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

### [65] [Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06969)
*Shoumeng Qiu,Xinrun Li,Yang Long,Xiangyang Xue,Varun Ojha,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapGR introduces global representation learning for online HD map construction, using GRL and GRG modules to infuse global context into DETR-like queries, yielding state-of-the-art mAP gains on nuScenes and Argoverse2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based HD map construction relies on independent, learnable object queries that focus locally and miss global map structure; a global representation is needed to improve consistency and accuracy.

Method: GRL module enforces a holistic segmentation task to align all queries with the global map; GRG module provides each query with explicit global-level contextual information to guide its optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluation on nuScenes and Argoverse2 shows substantial mAP improvements over leading baselines.

Conclusion: Global representation learning for HD maps is effective; leveraging global context via GRL and GRG enhances DETR-based HD map construction.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

### [66] [Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06973)
*Zhantao Yang,Huangji Wang,Ruili Feng,Han Zhang,Yuting Hu,Shangwen Zhu,Junyan Li,Yu Liu,Fan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RICE, a LVLM-based method to improve ID-Matching in long video captioning by leveraging richer image usage and more detailed identity-focused descriptions; introduces a benchmark and achieves large gains in ID-Matching precision and recall, enabling continuous identity tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video captioning suffers from ID-Matching challenges where the same person appears across frames. Existing methods rely on point-wise matching and generalization is limited. LVLMs like GPT-4o offer strong priors that can be exploited to improve identity consistency in captions.

Method: 1) Build a benchmark to assess ID-Matching in video captions. 2) Investigate LVLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to uncover latent ID-Matching capabilities. 3) Identify two levers: (a) better usage of image information, (b) increasing the amount of per-person descriptive information. 4) Propose Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE) to encode and propagate identities across frames in captions.

Result: Experiments show substantial gains in ID-Matching when using GPT-4o with RICE: precision rises from 50% to 90%, recall from 15% to 80% relative to baseline. Also improves overall captioning quality and the ability to continuously track individuals in long videos.

Conclusion: RICE demonstrates that LVLMs can be effectively harnessed to solve the ID-Matching problem in long video captioning, enabling reliable continuous tracking of multiple identities. The benchmark and findings offer a path for improved text-to-video understanding and captioning realism.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

*Girolamo Macaluso,Lorenzo Mandelli,Mirko Bicchierai,Stefano Berretti,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-training reinforcement-learning fine-tuning of pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without any motion ground-truth data, to adapt to unseen actions/styles while preserving the original distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapt diffusion-based motion generators to new actions or styles without costly motion capture data or full retraining, enabling data-efficient, privacy-preserving adaptation.

Method: A post-training RL framework that uses a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO). This operates on both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures and requires no paired motion data.

Result: Cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show improved quality and diversity of generated motions (per quantitative metrics and user studies) while maintaining performance on the original distribution.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation that shifts the model's generative distribution toward a target domain without relying on ground-truth motion data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

*Gianmarco Perantoni,Giulio Weikmann,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning–Bayesian approach that combines Transformer Encoder–based DNNs with a Hidden Markov Model to enforce temporal consistency in yearly land-cover classification from multiyear SITS, achieving improved F1 on six years of Sentinel-2 data across 47 crop types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of producing temporally consistent yearly land-cover labels and to exploit both within-year feature representations and across-year temporal patterns in crop-type sequences.

Method: A cascade model where a Transformer Encoder–based DNN is augmented with a Hidden Markov Model layer on top (HMM on TE), enabling sequential, temporally coherent classification of yearly crop types across years across six-year Sentinel-2 data.

Result: In validation on a multiyear dataset with 47 crop types, modelling temporal consistency via HMMs improves overall performance and F1 scores, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed TE+DNN with an HMM layer effectively captures temporal correlations in yearly SITS and multiyear crop-type sequences, leading to improved classification stability and accuracy; a promising approach for multiyear land-cover mapping.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

*Fenghe Tang,Chengqi Dong,Wenxin Ma,Zikang Xu,Heqin Zhu,Zihang Jiang,Rongsheng Wang,Yuhao Wang,Chenxu Wu,Shaohua Kevin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark (U-Bench) evaluating 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 modalities, introducing U-Score for performance-efficiency trade-offs, with systematic analysis, a model advisor, and public release to guide deployment and future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive, statistically validated, and efficiency-aware benchmarking for U-Net variants, enabling fair comparisons, robust generalization assessment, and practical deployment guidance.

Method: Evaluate 100 U-Net variants on 28 datasets across 10 imaging modalities, assessing statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency; introduce U-Score as a deployment-oriented metric; conduct systematic analysis of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms; develop a model advisor to guide method selection; release code, models, protocols, and weights publicly.

Result: Demonstrates the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural choices on performance; proposes U-Score to capture performance-efficiency trade-offs; provides guidance via a model advisor; enables reproducibility through public code and weights; positions U-Bench as a foundation for fair, reproducible benchmarking in U-Net-based segmentation.

Conclusion: U-Bench reveals gaps in prior evaluations and establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking for U-Net-based segmentation, with broad utility for researchers and practitioners and potential extensibility to future methods.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

### [70] [Concept Retrieval -- What and How?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07058)
*Ori nizan,Oren Shrout,Ayellet Tal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes concept-based image retrieval that targets central concepts in images, modeling the neighborhood of embeddings as a bimodal Gaussian to reveal meaningful concept structure, with formal problem definition, evaluation metrics, and empirical validation including qualitative, quantitative, and human studies; implementation available as coret on PyPI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval and clustering focus on visual similarity or general semantics, but fail to capture the underlying narrative concepts that tie images together. There is a need for a formal framework to identify and retrieve images sharing central concepts, beyond surface-level features.

Method: Formally define a retrieval problem based on central concepts. Observe that neighbors in embedding space may share different concepts; model the local concept distribution as a bimodal Gaussian to separate concept groups. Use this to identify and extract central concepts and retrieval results. Provide evaluation metrics and perform qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations. Release implementation (coret) on PyPI.

Result: The approach yields meaningful concept-based retrieval results, outperforming baseline methods in identifying central concepts, validated by multiple evaluation modalities.

Conclusion: Modeling the neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian reveals coherent concept structure enabling better identification of central concepts for retrieval. The framework, metrics, and evaluation support its effectiveness, with a usable package available.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input
image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central
concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond
conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or
semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,
and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:

TL;DR: DADO uses depth-attention fusion with dynamic weighting to unsupervisedly discover unseen objects, achieving superior accuracy and robustness without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised object discovery is challenging, especially with noisy attention maps and scenes with multiple depth planes, and existing methods require labels or manual tuning.

Method: A model that combines an attention mechanism and a depth model, with a dynamic weighting module that adaptively emphasizes either attention or depth features based on the global characteristics of each image; trained in a self-supervised manner.

Result: On standard benchmarks, DADO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DADO provides a robust unsupervised object discovery approach by fusing depth and attention with dynamic weighting, enabling effective discovery of unseen objects without labeled data.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects
in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a
growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model,
DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen
Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify
potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

*Rémi Kazmierczak,Steve Azzolin,Eloïse Berthier,Goran Frehse,Gianni Franchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) can hallucinate concepts, compromising explanation faithfulness; the authors propose CHILI to localize target concepts and inhibit hallucination, yielding more interpretable saliency explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI using CLIP-derived concepts in CBMs suffers from concept hallucination; need a method to ensure faithful, interpretable explanations.

Method: Propose Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI) that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts, enabling saliency-based explanations.

Result: Demonstrates that CLIP is prone to concept hallucination in CBM contexts; CHILI localizes concepts and provides more interpretable saliency explanations.

Conclusion: CHILI mitigates concept hallucination in zero-shot CLIP-based CBMs and improves the interpretability and faithfulness of generated explanations.

Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations,
relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show
that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free monocular geometry refinement method (MoRe) uses graph-based local planar optimization over inter-frame correspondences to achieve scale-aligned, cross-view-consistent 3D reconstruction and improved sparse-view novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D foundation models offer rich geometric priors but suffer from scale ambiguity and cross-frame inconsistency. A training-free refinement that leverages inter-frame correspondences and preserves 3D structure is desirable to improve reconstruction and view synthesis.

Method: They establish inter-frame correspondences via feature matching. Instead of simple least-squares on points, they perform a graph-based optimization that enforces local planar approximations using 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models, addressing scale ambiguity while preserving structure.

Result: MoRe enhances 3D reconstruction quality and improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Conclusion: MoRe demonstrates that a training-free geometric refinement using graph-based local planar optimization with monocular priors can achieve scale-aligned, cross-view-consistent 3D geometry and better view synthesis.

Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception
tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this
paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

*Jan Fiszer,Dominika Ciupek,Maciej Malawski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning with non-IID MRI normalization variations achieves near-centralized brain tumor segmentation performance (3D Dice ~92%), showing FL resilience to data normalization heterogeneity and preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging DL is data-hungry and privacy-sensitive; non-IID data due to varying MRI normalization can hinder performance. FL offers privacy-preserving training but its effectiveness under such heterogeneity needs assessment.

Method: Create non-IID subsets by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data portions; train and test brain tumor segmentation models under FL and compare to a centralized model; evaluate 3D Dice score.

Result: FL methods reached 3D Dice around 92%, comparable to centralized model; FL showed resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients.

Conclusion: Federated learning is a viable approach for training high-performing medical imaging models without data sharing, mitigating privacy concerns while maintaining performance; code is available.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

*Sarah Cechnicka,Matthew Baugh,Weitong Zhang,Mischa Dombrowski,Zhe Li,Johannes C. Paetzold,Candice Roufosse,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph-conditioned diffusion with object-level graphs enables controllable, semantically structured medical image synthesis and data substitution for segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images have inherent spatial structure and priors; conventional diffusion models operate in noisy latent spaces, offering limited semantic control in sensitive domains.

Method: Represent major image structures as graph nodes capturing features and relations; process with a transformer; integrate into a diffusion model via text-conditioning to enable fine-grained control; evaluate on a real-world histopathology use case.

Result: Generated data can reliably substitute annotated patient data for downstream segmentation tasks in a real-world histopathology scenario.

Conclusion: Graph-based object-level conditioning improves controllability and semantic structure in diffusion models for medical imaging, enabling safer, more precise generation with practical data augmentation potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new
standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains
challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

*Karim El Khoury,Maxime Zanella,Christophe De Vleeschouwer,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Few-shot adaptation for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) is variably effective across models; no universal winner, highlighting need for robust, RS-tailored methods. A reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code are provided to study RSVLM few-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSVLMs achieve strong zero-shot performance but their ability to generalize in low-data regimes (few-shot) is underexplored in remote sensing; a structured benchmark is needed to evaluate and compare few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs.

Method: Benchmark design: evaluate five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets on three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. The authors also provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code.

Result: Models with similar zero-shot performance can behave very differently under few-shot adaptation; some RSVLMs are inherently more amenable to few-shot adaptation than others; there is substantial variability and no clear winner among existing methods.

Conclusion: There is a need to develop more robust, RS-tailored few-shot adaptation methods. The authors supply a reproducible benchmarking framework and code to facilitate future research in this area.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable
potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot
performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data
regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this
work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot
adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a
reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically
evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions. The source code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple image downsampling often beats advanced visual token compression methods on standard benchmarks; benchmarks for this task are noisy and misaligned with compression goals; the authors propose VTC-Bench, a data-filtered evaluation framework to denoise benchmarks and enable fairer assessment; data and code are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark benchmarks for visual token compression in Multimodal LLMs are task-misaligned and noisy, hindering fair evaluation of compression methods; a more reliable evaluation framework is needed.

Method: Conducted extensive empirical comparisons between simple downsampling and various visual token compression methods across multiple benchmarks; analyzed benchmark noise and the impact of sample difficulty; proposed VTC-Bench that incorporates a data filtering mechanism (via downsampling) to denoise benchmarks; released data and code.

Result: Downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods on several benchmarks; current benchmarks are noisy for this task; downsampling can serve as a data filter to gauge sample difficulty; VTC-Bench provides a denoised evaluation framework for fairer assessments.

Conclusion: To fairly assess visual token compression, benchmarks must be denoised/filtered to align with the compression task; VTC-Bench offers a practical framework to enable more accurate and comparable evaluation, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness
of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an
evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise
existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of
visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at

### [78] [MV-Performer: Taming Video Diffusion Model for Faithful and Synchronized Multi-view Performer Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07190)
*Yihao Zhi,Chenghong Li,Hongjie Liao,Xihe Yang,Zhengwentai Sun,Jiahao Chang,Xiaodong Cun,Wensen Feng,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-Performer is a diffusion-based framework that enables synchronized, 360-degree 4D novel-view videos from monocular full-body captures, achieving state-of-the-art results on three datasets by leveraging MVHumanNet, camera-dependent normal maps from oriented partial point clouds, and a robust in-the-wild inference scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion methods excel at editing within front views but struggle to synthesize full 360-degree viewpoint changes for humans. There is a need for a synchronized, robust 4D (spatio-temporal) human-centric synthesis from monocular captures, capable of handling depth-ambiguity and in-the-wild artefacts.

Method: MV-Performer introduces a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model conditioned on informative signals, including camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds and references from MVHumanNet. It fuses information from the reference video, partial renderings, and multiple viewpoints to synthesize coherent 360-degree videos, with a robust inference procedure for real-world depth estimation errors.

Result: Experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness in 360-degree human 4D novel-view synthesis, with synchronized multi-view outputs and improved resilience to monocular depth inaccuracies.

Conclusion: MV-Performer advances 4D human-centric novel-view synthesis by enabling synchronized 360-degree video generation from monocular captures, leveraging camera-conditioned normals and multi-view diffusion, and showing strong performance and robustness across datasets.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and
diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as
implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily
concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while
struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on
human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for
creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To
achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel
view synthesis.

### [79] [Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07191)
*Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh,Mina Shaigan,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3 improves certain chest radiography representations over DINOv2 and ImageNet when using higher resolution (512x512) and ConvNeXt-B backbones; benefits are strongest for boundary-focused lesions; 1024x1024 adds little; frozen 7B features underperform without domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether DINOv3’s Gram-anchored self-distillation design and other SSL choices translate into transfer gains for chest radiography across multiple datasets and backbones.

Method: Benchmark DINOv3 vs DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven chest radiography datasets (n>814k) using ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B backbones. Analyze 224, 512, and 1024 pixel resolutions; also evaluate frozen features from a 7B model. Primary outcome: mean AUROC across labels.

Result: At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 were comparable on adult datasets. Increasing to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. Pediatric cohorts showed no initialization differences. ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed versus finetuned 86–89M backbones, highlighting the need for domain adaptation. 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities.

Conclusion: Higher input resolution is key to leveraging modern SSL in chest radiography. 512x512 with DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B represents a practical upper limit with the strongest performance; larger inputs offer minimal returns. Clinically, use finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512, with the greatest gains for subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency/critical care.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

### [80] [EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07206)
*Shirin Shoushtari,Yi Wang,Xiao Shi,M. Salman Asif,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EigenScore uses the eigenvalue spectrum of a diffusion model's posterior covariance for OOD detection, estimated with Jacobian-free subspace iteration on forward denoiser passes, achieving SOTA AUROC and robustness in near-OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is essential for safe ML deployment. Diffusion models can capture complex data distributions, but existing diffusion-based detectors struggle in near-OOD scenarios; a reliable, signal-rich cue from the posterior covariance spectrum is desirable.

Method: Analyze the posterior covariance of diffusion denoisers to show that its trace and leading eigenvalues increase under distribution shift. Establish a theoretical link between posterior covariance and distribution mismatch. Estimate the top eigenvalues without Jacobians by using a Jacobian-free subspace iteration that relies only on forward denoiser evaluations.

Result: Empirically achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 5 percentage points AUROC improvement over strong baselines. Demonstrates robustness in near-OOD setups (e.g., CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100) where other diffusion-based detectors falter.

Conclusion: Posterior covariance of the diffusion denoiser provides a reliable, tractable signal for OOD detection. EigenScore leverages this spectral signature to deliver strong, robust OOD detection performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

*Wen Ye,Zhaocheng Liu,Yuwei Gui,Tingyu Yuan,Yunyue Su,Bowen Fang,Chaoyang Zhao,Qiang Liu,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play, model-agnostic GenPilot system performs test-time prompt optimization via a multi-agent framework to improve text-to-image consistency and coherence for long prompts, achieving notable gains on DPG-bench and Geneval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long, complex prompts often cause semantic gaps and missing details in text-to-image synthesis. Existing fixes (fine-tuning) are model-specific and costly, while automatic prompt optimization lacks systematic error analysis. There is a need for an interpretable, efficient, and general approach that adapts prompts at test time.

Method: GenPilot is a plug-and-play multi-agent system that operates directly on input text. It combines error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module to iteratively optimize prompts. It is model-agnostic, interpretable, and designed to handle long prompts by decomposing and refining text through collaborative agents and memory.

Result: Empirical evaluation on DPG-bench and Geneval shows improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% in text-image consistency and structural coherence, respectively, demonstrating GenPilot’s effectiveness in refining prompts and improving image quality. The approach is accompanied by a summarized catalog of common error patterns and refinement strategies, and code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: GenPilot provides a flexible, interpretable, and broadly applicable solution for test-time prompt optimization that enhances long-prompt understanding and image fidelity across models. It highlights the value of systematic error analysis, adaptive exploration, and memory-enabled refinement for robust text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately
interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting
in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis
and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.
Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

*Jiaben Chen,Zixin Wang,Ailing Zeng,Yang Fu,Xueyang Yu,Siyuan Cen,Julian Tanke,Yihang Chen,Koichi Saito,Yuki Mitsufuji,Chuang Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TalkCuts is a large-scale, multi-shot speech video dataset (164k clips, ~500 hours) with rich annotations (2D keypoints, 3D SMPL-X, 10k identities) designed for multi-shot video generation; Orator demonstrates an LLM-guided baseline for coordinating camera moves, gestures, and voice; training on TalkCuts improves cinematographic coherence and visual appeal in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets mostly cover single-shot, static viewpoints, limiting the study of dynamic, multi-shot speech video generation and multimodal alignment. TalkCuts aims to enable controllable, long-form, multi-shot synthesis and evaluation.

Method: 1) Build a large-scale, multi-shot human speech video dataset with diverse camera perspectives and detailed annotations (2D keypoints, 3D SMPL-X, 10k identities). 2) Propose Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework where the language model acts as director to specify camera transitions, gesticulations, and vocal modulation, integrated with a multi-modal video generation module for long-form synthesis. 3) Conduct experiments in pose-guided and audio-driven settings to evaluate cinematographic coherence.

Result: Training on TalkCuts significantly enhances cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. The dataset supports diverse shots (close-up to full-body) and rich multimodal annotations, enabling robust evaluation and learning for multi-shot generation.

Conclusion: TalkCuts provides a solid foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning, enabling scalable evaluation and development of long-form, multi-camera speech synthesis.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

### [83] [Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07277)
*Franco Javier Arellano,José Ignacio Orlando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models for DME detection in fundus images do not consistently beat fine-tuned CNNs; EfficientNet-B0 is often strong; FLAIR shows zero-shot promise; lightweight CNNs remain solid baselines in data-scarce settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DME detection is challenged by limited annotated data; foundation models offer potential data efficiency and transfer capabilities. This work systematically evaluates FM variants against standard CNN baselines for DME detection across multiple datasets.

Method: Empirical study comparing RETFound, FLAIR, and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone across different training regimes and evaluation settings on IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2, and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Metrics include AUC and PR curves; FLAIR evaluated in zero-shot with prompting.

Result: FM did not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs for DME detection. EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in most settings; RETFound showed promise mainly in OEFI; FLAIR demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance when prompted appropriately.

Conclusion: Foundation models may not be the best tool for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks like DME detection in data-scarce scenarios. Lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines; FM might be more suited to zero-shot or transfer scenarios rather than fine-tuned performance for this task.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

*Inzamamul Alam,Md Tanvir Islam,Khan Muhammad,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecGuard delivers robust and invisible watermarking by embedding in hidden convolution layers in the frequency domain via spectral projection using wavelet decomposition and FFT; decoder uses Parseval's theorem; claims superior robustness and reproducibility with code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world watermarking requires resilience to distortions, regeneration, and adversarial perturbations while remaining invisible; existing methods struggle under these transformations.

Method: Embed watermark in hidden conv layers by transforming spatial domain to frequency domain through spectral projection. Use high-frequency band decomposed by wavelet projection; FFT approximation for efficiency. Strength factor in encoding to improve robustness against a broad set of attacks. Decode with a Parseval-based approach to learn and extract the watermark.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows SpecGuard outperforms state-of-the-art models in invisibility, capacity, and robustness under diverse distortions and adversarial/regeneration-based attacks; full code released on GitHub.

Conclusion: Spectral-domain watermarking with hidden-layer embedding and Parseval-based decoding provides robust, invisible watermarking and can be reproduced; the approach addresses key real-world challenges in watermarking.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New MATRIX-11K dataset reveals how video diffusion transformers encode interactions and introduces MATRIX regularization plus InterGenEval to improve interaction grounding and propagation, reducing drift and hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in understanding how video DiTs internally represent multi-instance interactions and persistent instance bindings across frames, which current models struggle to capture.

Method: Curate MATRIX-11K with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance masks; perform a two-pronged analysis via video-to-text attention (semantic grounding) and video-to-video attention (semantic propagation); identify that interaction signals concentrate in a few layers; propose MATRIX regularization aligning attention with multi-instance masks; introduce InterGenEval for interaction-aware generation; release code/weights.

Result: Findings show that interaction effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers; MATRIX improves interaction fidelity and semantic alignment, while reducing drift and hallucination; extensive ablations validate design choices.

Conclusion: A simple regularization grounded in instance-aware supervision can significantly enhance interaction modeling in video DiTs and provide a practical evaluation protocol for interaction-aware generation.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel-space diffusion for monocular depth estimation yields flying-pixel-free depth-derived point clouds, using SP-DiT semantic prompting and Cascade DiT token-cascade to boost efficiency and accuracy; achieves state-of-the-art across five benchmarks and excels in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address artifacts (flying pixels) caused by latent diffusion approaches that compress depth maps via VAE for latent space; aim to preserve edges and global semantics while maintaining high quality in depth-guided point clouds.

Method: Perform diffusion generation directly in pixel space to avoid VAE-induced artifacts. Introduce Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT) that incorporate semantic cues from vision foundation models into DiT to maintain global semantics while refining details, and a Cascade DiT design that progressively increases the number of tokens to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Achieves best performance among all published generative depth models across five benchmarks and significantly outperforms other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation due to reduced edge artifacts.

Conclusion: Pixel-space diffusion with SP-DiT semantics prompting and Cascade DiT token cascading effectively mitigates VAE-induced artifacts and delivers high-quality, edge-preserving depth estimates and point clouds, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a comprehensive reference that bridges computer vision with quantum computing, highlighting potential advantages in scalability and future viability of quantum-accelerated vision methods, and to prepare CV scholars to engage with QeCV research.

Method: Holistic literature review and synthesis. The paper introduces QeCV concepts, explains hardware-compatible formulations, surveys gate-based and annealing paradigms, describes available tools and learning resources, and discusses publishing practices, open challenges, and social implications.

Result: A comprehensive introduction and reference for the CV community, including taxonomy of quantum paradigms, toolchains, and educational materials, laying groundwork for future QeCV method development and evaluation.

Conclusion: QeCV shows promise but hinges on developing new algorithms compatible with quantum hardware and addressing practical, evaluative, and societal considerations; success will require standardized benchmarks, broader education, and careful assessment of social implications.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tenet: a framework that enables referring video object segmentation by generating and selecting temporal prompts from detectors/tracking to adapt image-based foundation segmentation models, with Prompt Preference Learning to choose high-quality prompts, reducing reliance on dense masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVOS methods rely on costly end-to-end dense mask annotations and scaling limits; want to leverage foundation models and off-the-shelf detectors/trackers to efficiently adapt to RVOS.

Method: Decompose RVOS into referring, video, and segmentation factors. Generate temporal prompts via detectors/trackers aligned with the referring sentence. Use Prompt Preference Learning to assess prompt quality. Use image-based foundation segmentation models guided by prompts to produce masks. Tenet framework.

Result: Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of Tenet, enabling efficient adaptation without heavy reannotation.

Conclusion: Tenet provides a practical pathway to transfer image-based foundation models to RVOS by temporal prompting and prompt selection, improving scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.

### [89] [Vi-TacMan: Articulated Object Manipulation via Vision and Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06339)
*Leiyao Cui,Zihang Zhao,Sirui Xie,Wenhuan Zhang,Zhi Han,Yixin Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A vision-tactile framework (Vi-TacMan) enables robust, generalized articulated-object manipulation without explicit kinematic models by using vision to seed grasps and coarse directions and tactile feedback to refine execution; surface normals as priors and von Mises-Fisher modeling enable precise, real-time contact control; demonstrated strong cross-category generalization over 50k trials with significant gains (p<0.0001).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated-object manipulation in unstructured human environments is hard: vision alone gives coarse kinematics but can be imprecise; tactile control offers precision but needs good initialization. There is a need for a framework that leverages both modalities for generalization.

Method: Combine vision-based grasp/ direction proposals with a tactile controller. Use surface normals as geometric priors and model motion directions with von Mises-Fisher distributions to guide contact-based refinement. The tactile controller regulates contact in real-time, refining coarse visual estimates without explicit kinematic models.

Result: Significant improvement over baselines (p<0.0001). Demonstrated on 50,000+ simulated and real-world objects, with robust cross-category generalization.

Conclusion: Coarse visual cues are sufficient for reliable manipulation when paired with tactile feedback, enabling a scalable, perception-to-action paradigm for autonomous manipulation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of articulated objects remains a fundamental
challenge for robots in human environments. Vision-based methods can infer
hidden kinematics but can yield imprecise estimates on unfamiliar objects.
Tactile approaches achieve robust control through contact feedback but require
accurate initialization. This suggests a natural synergy: vision for global
guidance, touch for local precision. Yet no framework systematically exploits
this complementarity for generalized articulated manipulation. Here we present
Vi-TacMan, which uses vision to propose grasps and coarse directions that seed
a tactile controller for precise execution. By incorporating surface normals as
geometric priors and modeling directions via von Mises-Fisher distributions,
our approach achieves significant gains over baselines (all p<0.0001).
Critically, manipulation succeeds without explicit kinematic models -- the
tactile controller refines coarse visual estimates through real-time contact
regulation. Tests on more than 50,000 simulated and diverse real-world objects
confirm robust cross-category generalization. This work establishes that coarse
visual cues suffice for reliable manipulation when coupled with tactile
feedback, offering a scalable paradigm for autonomous systems in unstructured
environments.

### [90] [A Formal gatekeeper Framework for Safe Dual Control with Active Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06351)
*Kaleb Ben Naveed,Devansh R. Agrawal,Dimitra Panagou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A safety-oriented framework that integrates robust planning with active, verifiable exploration under formal guarantees. It uses a gatekeeper-style safety verifier to generate trajectories that are both safe and informative, pursuing uncertainty reduction only when it verifiably improves mission cost within a budget; demonstrated in online quadrotor dual control under parametric uncertainty in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in system dynamics leads to conservative planning if worst-case, and naive exploration can compromise safety. There is a need for active information gathering that is provably beneficial and safe during an ongoing mission.

Method: Extend a safety-verification (gatekeeper) architecture to jointly produce safe and informative trajectories. Exploration is conditional on verifiable improvement to the mission objective and is constrained by a user-defined budget. The approach integrates robust planning with active information gathering within formal safety guarantees and is evaluated on online dual control of a quadrotor with parametric uncertainty in simulation.

Result: Simulation-based evaluation showing that the framework can generate trajectories that reduce uncertainty while keeping safety and mission cost within the defined budget, outperforming purely conservative or heuristic exploration approaches.

Conclusion: The work presents a principled way to fuse safety verification with informative, budget-bounded exploration for robust, online dual-control tasks. It broadens safe autonomy by enabling purposeful uncertainty reduction without sacrificing safety; applicability to other dynamic systems is suggested, with future work likely including real-world validation and scalability assessment.

Abstract: Planning safe trajectories under model uncertainty is a fundamental
challenge. Robust planning ensures safety by considering worst-case
realizations, yet ignores uncertainty reduction and leads to overly
conservative behavior. Actively reducing uncertainty on-the-fly during a
nominal mission defines the dual control problem. Most approaches address this
by adding a weighted exploration term to the cost, tuned to trade off the
nominal objective and uncertainty reduction, but without formal consideration
of when exploration is beneficial. Moreover, safety is enforced in some methods
but not in others. We propose a framework that integrates robust planning with
active exploration under formal guarantees as follows: The key innovation and
contribution is that exploration is pursued only when it provides a verifiable
improvement without compromising safety. To achieve this, we utilize our
earlier work on gatekeeper as an architecture for safety verification, and
extend it so that it generates both safe and informative trajectories that
reduce uncertainty and the cost of the mission, or keep it within a
user-defined budget. The methodology is evaluated via simulation case studies
on the online dual control of a quadrotor under parametric uncertainty.

### [91] [Constrained Natural Language Action Planning for Resilient Embodied Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06357)
*Grayson Byrd,Corban Rivera,Bethany Kemp,Meghan Booker,Aurora Schmidt,Celso M de Melo,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robotic planning framework that augments LLM-based planning with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability, repeatability, and transparency, achieving state-of-the-art results on ALFWorld and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based task planning can hallucinate and relies on opaque prompt engineering, reducing reliability and repeatability. Symbolic planning offers reliability but struggles with scale and real-world ambiguity. A hybrid approach aims to combine strengths while mitigating weaknesses.

Method: Integrate symbolic planning oversight with LLM planners to enforce hard constraints and provide transparent guidance, preserving LLM reasoning while enhancing reliability and repeatability. Validate on ALFWorld (99% success) and a real-world quadruped robot (100% success) across pick-and-place tasks.

Result: On ALFWorld, the approach achieves ~99% success, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. In real-world tests with a quadruped robot, it achieves 100% task success, outperforming pure LLM planners (≈50%) and pure symbolic planners (≈30%).

Conclusion: Augmenting LLM planners with symbolic oversight yields a more reliable, repeatable, and transparent planning system without sacrificing flexibility or generalization, advancing resilient embodied intelligent systems.

Abstract: Replicating human-level intelligence in the execution of embodied tasks
remains challenging due to the unconstrained nature of real-world environments.
Novel use of large language models (LLMs) for task planning seeks to address
the previously intractable state/action space of complex planning tasks, but
hallucinations limit their reliability, and thus, viability beyond a research
context. Additionally, the prompt engineering required to achieve adequate
system performance lacks transparency, and thus, repeatability. In contrast to
LLM planning, symbolic planning methods offer strong reliability and
repeatability guarantees, but struggle to scale to the complexity and ambiguity
of real-world tasks. We introduce a new robotic planning method that augments
LLM planners with symbolic planning oversight to improve reliability and
repeatability, and provide a transparent approach to defining hard constraints
with considerably stronger clarity than traditional prompt engineering.
Importantly, these augmentations preserve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
and retain impressive generalization in open-world environments. We demonstrate
our approach in simulated and real-world environments. On the ALFWorld planning
benchmark, our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
a near-perfect 99% success rate. Deployment of our method to a real-world
quadruped robot resulted in 100% task success compared to 50% and 30% for pure
LLM and symbolic planners across embodied pick and place tasks. Our approach
presents an effective strategy to enhance the reliability, repeatability and
transparency of LLM-based robot planners while retaining their key strengths:
flexibility and generalizability to complex real-world environments. We hope
that this work will contribute to the broad goal of building resilient embodied
intelligent systems.

*Amirhossein Mollaei Khass,Guangyi Liu,Vivek Pandey,Wen Jiang,Boshu Lei,Kostas Daniilidis,Nader Motee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified risk-aware navigation framework that refines a coarse path via tail-risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk on a 3D Gaussian-splat radiance field, and selects Next-Best-View poses on SE(3) using Riemannian gradient descent to maximize information gain, with online updates and scalable gradients, validated by computational studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires integrating risk aversion with active perception; current methods struggle to combine risk-aware planning with online perception and efficient updates.

Method: Construct tail-sensitive risk maps using Average Value-at-Risk on a 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field; refine reference path with these maps. For perception, formulate NBV selection as an optimization on SE(3); use Riemannian gradient descent to maximize expected information gain; develop scalable gradient decompositions for online updates; demonstrate online performance in complex environments.

Result: The approach yields locally safe and feasible trajectories while reducing uncertainty most critical for imminent motion; demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and efficient online updates through computational studies.

Conclusion: Couples risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning and scalable gradient decompositions to advance safe navigation in uncertain environments and enable scalable online updates.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

### [93] [What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: How Well do Latent Safety Filters Understand Partially Observable Safety Constraints?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06492)
*Matthew Kim,Kensuke Nakamura,Andrea Bajcsy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RGB-only latent safe control can be myopic; authors quantify when observations miss safety cues with a mutual-information measure, and propose multimodal supervised training to shape latent representations; validated in simulation and on a Franka manipulator to prevent a wax pot from overheating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe control methods (e.g., Hamilton-Jacobi reachability) assume good state observability or hand-designed state spaces. Latent-space safe control learns representations and dynamics from data but may fail if safety-critical features are not captured in the latent state. This work investigates when latent spaces are sufficient for safety, using temperature-based overheating as a testbed.

Method: Introduce a mutual-information-based measure to detect when observations fail to capture safety-relevant features in the latent space. Propose a multimodal-supervised training strategy that incorporates additional sensor modalities during training to shape the latent state, while keeping deployment modality requirements unchanged (no extra modalities at run-time). Validate in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 robot preventing a pot of wax from overheating.

Result: Demonstrates that RGB-only observations can induce myopic safety behaviors (focusing on avoiding failure states rather than preventing failure). The MI-based measure identifies when latent representations miss safety cues. The multimodal training approach mitigates this by embedding safety-relevant information into the latent space, enabling safer control. Hardware experiments with the Franka manipulator corroborate the simulation findings and show practical applicability.

Conclusion: Latent-space safety methods benefit from careful shaping of the latent representation to capture safety-relevant cues. When RGB-only latent spaces are insufficient, multimodal supervision during training (without requiring extra sensors at deployment) can improve safety. The MI diagnostic provides a practical tool to assess sufficiency of latent features for safe control.

Abstract: Safe control techniques, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, provide
principled methods for synthesizing safety-preserving robot policies but
typically assume hand-designed state spaces and full observability. Recent work
has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state
representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that
reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from
current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are
difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as
classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate
directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that
safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:
when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we
examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or
manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic
safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing
failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual
information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture
safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training
strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during
training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our
approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator
preventing a pot of wax from overheating.

### [94] [Real-Time Glass Detection and Reprojection using Sensor Fusion Onboard Aerial Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06518)
*Malakhi Hopkins,Varun Murali,Vijay Kumar,Camillo J Taylor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight onboard system for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles on a sub-300g quadrotor using ToF and ultrasonic sensors with a small 2D conv net to propagate depth into empty regions, enabling real-time mapping on CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent obstacles degrade depth sensing and mapping, and existing methods rely on expensive sensors or heavy computation, which are impractical for low-SWaP robots. There is a need for real-time, onboard detection and mapping of transparent objects to ensure safe navigation.

Method: Fuse data from a Time-of-Flight camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model that recognizes specular reflections and propagates their depth into empty shadow regions in the depth map, producing a complete display of transparent obstacles. The pipeline runs entirely on CPU on a sub-300g quadrotor in real time.

Result: Demonstrates real-time onboard transparent obstacle detection and mapping on a sub-300g quadrotor using CPU, validated in controlled and real-world environments by mapping indoor glass and showing accurate propagation of depth into depth-gap regions.

Conclusion: This work presents, to the authors' knowledge, the first real-time onboard transparent obstacle mapping system for a low-SWaP quadrotor, highlighting feasibility and potential for safe navigation with minimal computational resources, while leaving room for future generalization to other transparent materials and varying environments.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world
scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to
reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for
traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can
cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and
potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to
accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often
rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational
burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.
In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for
detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our
method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor
with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach
accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into
corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent
obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a
small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system
through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,
demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot
maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the
first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle
mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAISE is a closed-loop, autonomous platform that links liquid formulation optimization to surface wettability by measuring contact angles via automated imaging, with Bayesian optimization guiding iterative, multi-objective formulation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface wettability is crucial for biomedical devices, coatings, and textiles; there is a need for high-throughput, automated methods to optimize liquid formulations for desired contact-angle properties while accounting for impurities and cost.

Method: A robotic platform that mixes liquid ingredients to form formulation cocktails, dispenses droplets onto a high-throughput stage, captures images with a pick-and-place camera, and processes images to measure contact angles. It is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization client and a desirability-based multi-objective objective to navigate formulation space and find optimal, cost-efficient formulations.

Result: The system achieves ~1 contact angle measurement per minute and demonstrates the ability to explore surfactant wettability and combinations, including compensating for purity-related variations. Multi-objective BO identifies precise, application-aligned formulations using a desirability score that balances target angles, surfactant usage, and cost.

Conclusion: RAISE demonstrates autonomous linking of formulation space to contact-angle measurements in a closed-loop, with multi-objective optimization efficiently converging to formulations that satisfy researcher-defined criteria, enabling faster design of surface-wettability materials.

Abstract: Surface wettability is a critical design parameter for biomedical devices,
coatings, and textiles. Contact angle measurements quantify liquid-surface
interactions, which depend strongly on liquid formulation. Herein, we present
the Robotic Autonomous Imaging Surface Evaluator (RAISE), a closed-loop,
self-driving laboratory that is capable of linking liquid formulation
optimization with surface wettability assessment. RAISE comprises a full
experimental orchestrator with the ability of mixing liquid ingredients to
create varying formulation cocktails, transferring droplets of prepared
formulations to a high-throughput stage, and using a pick-and-place camera tool
for automated droplet image capture. The system also includes an automated
image processing pipeline to measure contact angles. This closed loop
experiment orchestrator is integrated with a Bayesian Optimization (BO) client,
which enables iterative exploration of new formulations based on previous
contact angle measurements to meet user-defined objectives. The system operates
in a high-throughput manner and can achieve a measurement rate of approximately
1 contact angle measurement per minute. Here we demonstrate RAISE can be used
to explore surfactant wettability and how surfactant combinations create
tunable formulations that compensate for purity-related variations.
Furthermore, multi-objective BO demonstrates how precise and optimal
formulations can be reached based on application-specific goals. The
optimization is guided by a desirability score, which prioritizes formulations
that are within target contact angle ranges, minimize surfactant usage and
reduce cost. This work demonstrates the capabilities of RAISE to autonomously
link liquid formulations to contact angle measurements in a closed-loop system,
using multi-objective BO to efficiently identify optimal formulations aligned
with researcher-defined criteria.

*Vincent Lam,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-free TD3-based workspace trajectory planner with a curriculum-based multi-critic and prioritized replay enables safe debris capture by space manipulators, demonstrated in simulation on a seven-DOF robotic arm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debris capture in space requires reliable, safe trajectory planning against uncertain, non-cooperative targets while avoiding self-collisions and unintended contact. A model-free approach aims to handle uncertainties and complex dynamics without explicit modeling.

Method: A TD3 agent performs model-free workspace trajectory planning with a local control strategy that includes singularity avoidance and manipulability enhancement. A curriculum-based multi-critic network is used (one critic for tracking accuracy, another for collision avoidance). A prioritized experience replay buffer accelerates learning. Evaluation is conducted in Matlab/Simulink on a simulated seven-DOF KUKA LBR iiwa mounted on a free-floating base.

Result: The framework achieves safe and adaptive trajectory generation for debris removal in simulation, demonstrating reliable tracking with collision avoidance and robust policy learning aided by prioritized replay.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows viability of model-free, safe trajectory planning for debris capture missions in a simulated setting, with potential extensions to real hardware experiments and more complex targets.

Abstract: The objective of this study is to develop a model-free workspace trajectory
planner for space manipulators using a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (TD3) agent to enable safe and reliable debris capture. A local
control strategy with singularity avoidance and manipulability enhancement is
employed to ensure stable execution. The manipulator must simultaneously track
a capture point on a non-cooperative target, avoid self-collisions, and prevent
unintended contact with the target. To address these challenges, we propose a
curriculum-based multi-critic network where one critic emphasizes accurate
tracking and the other enforces collision avoidance. A prioritized experience
replay buffer is also used to accelerate convergence and improve policy
robustness. The framework is evaluated on a simulated seven-degree-of-freedom
KUKA LBR iiwa mounted on a free-floating base in Matlab/Simulink, demonstrating
safe and adaptive trajectory generation for debris removal missions.

*Kruthika Gangaraju,Tanmayi Inaparthy,Jiaqi Yang,Yihao Zheng,Fengpei Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An adaptive, graduated, multimodal robotic framework for medication management in dementia care using Pepper, aligning with occupational therapy principles to preserve autonomy while ensuring adherence; features a 3-stage intervention (verbal reminders, verbal+gestural cues, full multimodal guidance) powered by LLM strategies and multimodal sensing, with preliminary usability evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People with dementia face declining abilities in medication management and current one-size-fits-all assistive technologies undermine autonomy and increase caregiver burden. Occupational therapy emphasizes matching assistance to individual capability. There is a need for adaptive robotic systems that provide graduated support.

Method: Develop a Pepper-based adaptive framework with a hierarchical intervention model: (1) simple verbal reminders, (2) verbal+gestural cues, (3) full multimodal guidance including physical navigation and step-by-step instructions. Uses LLM-driven interaction strategies and multimodal sensing to assess task state in real time and deliver just-enough assistance. Preliminary study in a controlled lab with healthy adults and dementia-care stakeholders to evaluate usability, comprehensibility, and appropriateness of feedback.

Result: Preliminary study focusing on feasibility and acceptability. Findings indicate the system is usable, comprehensible, and provides appropriately adaptive feedback according to task state; no efficacy data on medication adherence or clinical outcomes reported.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretically grounded translation of occupational therapy principles into human-robot interaction design, demonstrates multimodal adaptive support to preserve PLWD autonomy, and offers empirical insights from stakeholders on adaptive robotic care, laying groundwork for future efficacy evaluations.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLWDs) face progressively declining abilities in
medication management-from simple forgetfulness to complete task breakdown-yet
most assistive technologies fail to adapt to these changing needs. This
one-size-fits-all approach undermines autonomy, accelerates dependence, and
increases caregiver burden. Occupational therapy principles emphasize matching
assistance levels to individual capabilities: minimal reminders for those who
merely forget, spatial guidance for those who misplace items, and comprehensive
multimodal support for those requiring step-by-step instruction. However,
existing robotic systems lack this adaptive, graduated response framework
essential for maintaining PLWD independence. We present an adaptive multimodal
robotic framework using the Pepper robot that dynamically adjusts assistance
based on real-time assessment of user needs. Our system implements a
hierarchical intervention model progressing from (1) simple verbal reminders,
to (2) verbal + gestural cues, to (3) full multimodal guidance combining
physical navigation to medication locations with step-by-step verbal and
gestural instructions. Powered by LLM-driven interaction strategies and
multimodal sensing, the system continuously evaluates task states to provide
just-enough assistance-preserving autonomy while ensuring medication adherence.
We conducted a preliminary study with healthy adults and dementia care
stakeholders in a controlled lab setting, evaluating the system's usability,
comprehensibility, and appropriateness of adaptive feedback mechanisms. This
work contributes: (1) a theoretically grounded adaptive assistance framework
translating occupational therapy principles into HRI design, (2) a multimodal
robotic implementation that preserves PLWD dignity through graduated support,
and (3) empirical insights into stakeholder perceptions of adaptive robotic
care.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified RL framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models, RLinf-VLA, enabling scalable reinforcement-learning training across architectures, algorithms, and simulators; achieves substantial training speedups and strong task performance, with preliminary real-world deployment, aiming to standardize and advance embodied RL research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution shifts and error accumulation in SFT-based VLA models; create a fair, scalable, and comprehensive RL platform to compare architectures and algorithms across different simulators and tasks.

Method: A flexible RL framework (RLinf-VLA) with a hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation for GPU-parallelized simulators; supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO), and simulators (ManiSkill, LIBERO); achieves speedups (1.61x-1.88x) and high task performance (LIBERO: 98.11% across 130 tasks; ManiSkill: 97.66% across 25 tasks); includes a real-world deployment on a Franka robot demonstrating better generalization than SFT-trained policies.

Result: Demonstrates substantial training efficiency gains and high task-performance across simulated VLA benchmarks, plus preliminary real-world transfer with improved generalization over SFT.

Conclusion: RLinf-VLA provides a scalable, standardized platform for RL-based VLA training, enabling faster experimentation, broader architectural coverage, and better generalization; it lays groundwork for embodied intelligence research and potential real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly
advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge
of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained
with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under
distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through
interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified
platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and
algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and
efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a
highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of
integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In
particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel
hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup
in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse
VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a
unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25
ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best
practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns
in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a
real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger
generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a
foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.

### [99] [SanDRA: Safe Large-Language-Model-Based Decision Making for Automated Vehicles Using Reachability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06717)
*Yuanfei Lin,Sebastian Illing,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SanDRA is a safe LLM-based decision-making framework for automated vehicles that uses reachability analysis to ensure safety (and potential legal compliance) by converting LLM-generated actions into temporal logic and pruning unsafe options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety concerns of LLM-driven AV decisions, particularly hallucinations and lack of integrated vehicle dynamics, by providing provable safety guarantees through formal methods and ensuring compliance with traffic rules.

Method: Describe the driving scenario to an LLM to generate and rank feasible driving actions. Translate these actions into temporal-logic formulas that encode formalized traffic rules. Integrate these formulas into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions, and verify in open-loop and closed-loop driving experiments using both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned LLMs.

Result: SanDRA can produce provably safe driving actions, and when possible, legally compliant actions, even under high-density traffic. The approach is validated in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with various LLMs.

Conclusion: SanDRA is the first safe LLM-based decision framework for automated vehicles that combines language-driven action generation with formal reachability to ensure safety, with public code and experiments for reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to knowledge-driven
decision-making for automated vehicles due to their strong generalization and
reasoning capabilities. However, the safety of the resulting decisions cannot
be ensured due to possible hallucinations and the lack of integrated vehicle
dynamics. To address this issue, we propose SanDRA, the first safe
large-language-model-based decision making framework for automated vehicles
using reachability analysis. Our approach starts with a comprehensive
description of the driving scenario to prompt large language models to generate
and rank feasible driving actions. These actions are translated into temporal
logic formulas that incorporate formalized traffic rules, and are subsequently
integrated into reachability analysis to eliminate unsafe actions. We validate
our approach in both open-loop and closed-loop driving environments using
off-the-shelf and finetuned large language models, showing that it can provide
provably safe and, where possible, legally compliant driving actions, even
under high-density traffic conditions. To ensure transparency and facilitate
future research, all code and experimental setups are publicly available at

### [100] [UniFField: A Generalizable Unified Neural Feature Field for Visual, Semantic, and Spatial Uncertainties in Any Scene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06754)
*Christian Maurer,Snehal Jauhri,Sophie Lueth,Georgia Chalvatzaki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniFField introduces a unified, uncertainty-aware neural feature field that fuses visual, semantic, and geometric information into a single, generalizable representation with per-modality uncertainty, enabling zero-shot generalization and active decision-making in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in unstructured environments need comprehensive scene understanding and reliable uncertainty estimates. Existing 3D neural feature fields are often scene-specific and lack uncertainty modeling, limiting robust perception and decision-making.

Method: Propose UniFField, a voxel-based neural feature field that incrementally fuses RGB-D visual, semantic, and geometric features, along with per-modality uncertainty estimates. It supports zero-shot deployment to new scenes and updates as the robot explores by integrating new RGB-D data into the feature grid and updating uncertainties.

Result: Uncertainty estimates correlate with actual prediction errors in reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. The approach enables robust decision-making, demonstrated by an active object search task on a mobile manipulator using the predicted features and their uncertainties.

Conclusion: A generalizable, uncertainty-aware 3D feature representation that unifies multimodal information and uncertainty estimation, enabling reliable perception and decision-making in unseen environments without scene-specific training.

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is
crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured
and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is
necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information.
While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to
leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as
language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two
critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack
the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a
unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic,
and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also
predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied
zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into
our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene,
simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty
estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene
reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully
leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active
object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the
capability for robust decision-making.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kirigami-enabled robotic systems leverage lightweight, programmable cut-patterns to create multifunctional, deformable components (actuators, sensors, power, controllers) that enable shape morphing, flexible energy storage, and enhanced manipulation in varied tasks, though design optimization and scalable fabrication remain key challenges.


<details>

Abstract: Kirigami, the traditional paper-cutting craft, holds immense potential for
revolutionizing robotics by providing multifunctional, lightweight, and
adaptable solutions. Kirigami structures, characterized by their
bending-dominated deformation, offer resilience to tensile forces and
facilitate shape morphing under small actuation forces. Kirigami components
such as actuators, sensors, batteries, controllers, and body structures can be
tailored to specific robotic applications by optimizing cut patterns. Actuators

### [103] [Temporal-Prior-Guided View Planning for Periodic 3D Plant Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07028)
*Sicong Pan,Xuying Huang,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Temporal-prior-guided view planning uses prior plant geometry to reduce the number of views in periodic 3D reconstruction while maintaining coverage, by non-rigid alignment to partial observations, growth-aware inflation, and set-cover optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periodic crop monitoring requires repeated 3D scans; rebuilding from scratch wastes resources. Reusing past reconstructions and accounting for growth can reduce sensing effort and movement.

Method: Non-rigid alignment of a previously reconstructed plant model to the current partial observation, inflate the aligned model to accommodate growth, solve a set-cover optimization to select a minimal view set, acquire one additional next-best view for robustness, and plan a globally shortest path to connect the planned views, producing the best view sequence.

Result: Experiments on maize and tomato in hemisphere and sphere view spaces show maintained or improved surface coverage with fewer views and movement cost comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Temporal priors combined with growth-aware planning enable efficient, robust periodic plant reconstruction with reduced sensing requirements and similar movement costs compared to baselines.

Abstract: Periodic 3D reconstruction is essential for crop monitoring, but costly when
each cycle restarts from scratch, wasting resources and ignoring information
from previous captures. We propose temporal-prior-guided view planning for
periodic plant reconstruction, in which a previously reconstructed model of the
same plant is non-rigidly aligned to a new partial observation to form an
approximation of the current geometry. To accommodate plant growth, we inflate
this approximation and solve a set covering optimization problem to compute a
minimal set of views. We integrated this method into a complete pipeline that
acquires one additional next-best view before registration for robustness and
then plans a globally shortest path to connect the planned set of views and
outputs the best view sequence. Experiments on maize and tomato under
hemisphere and sphere view spaces show that our system maintains or improves
surface coverage while requiring fewer views and comparable movement cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

### [104] [Diffusing Trajectory Optimization Problems for Recovery During Multi-Finger Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07030)
*Abhinav Kumar,Fan Yang,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-model-based recovery framework for multi-fingered manipulation that detects when to recover and plans contact-rich recovery trajectories; includes a diffusion distillation for online efficiency; beats baselines by 96% on a screwdriver task and can recover without catastrophic failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perturbations hinder manipulation; need autonomous recovery to resume tool-use tasks; existing methods lack explicit contact-aware recovery or robust detection of failure states; use diffusion models for out-of-distribution detection and trajectory optimization for recovery.

Method: Train a task-specific diffusion model to detect out-of-distribution states indicating failed/task-unsafe conditions; use diffusion sampling to map such states back to in-distribution; plan contact-rich recovery trajectories with trajectory optimization; propose a diffusion-based distillation to compress full parameterization (constraints, goals, init) into a fast online sampler.

Result: Compared to RL and non-contact-planning methods on a hardware screwdriver-turning task; recovery using the proposed method improves task performance by 96%; only method evaluated capable of attempting recovery without catastrophic failure; videos linked.

Conclusion: The approach enables autonomous identification of when recovery is needed and efficient planning of contact-rich recovery trajectories, enhancing robustness of dexterous, multi-finger manipulation in the presence of perturbations; diffusion-based distillation makes online planning feasible.

Abstract: Multi-fingered hands are emerging as powerful platforms for performing fine
manipulation tasks, including tool use. However, environmental perturbations or
execution errors can impede task performance, motivating the use of recovery
behaviors that enable normal task execution to resume. In this work, we take
advantage of recent advances in diffusion models to construct a framework that
autonomously identifies when recovery is necessary and optimizes contact-rich
trajectories to recover. We use a diffusion model trained on the task to
estimate when states are not conducive to task execution, framed as an
out-of-distribution detection problem. We then use diffusion sampling to
project these states in-distribution and use trajectory optimization to plan
contact-rich recovery trajectories. We also propose a novel diffusion-based
approach that distills this process to efficiently diffuse the full
parameterization, including constraints, goal state, and initialization, of the
recovery trajectory optimization problem, saving time during online execution.
We compare our method to a reinforcement learning baseline and other methods
that do not explicitly plan contact interactions, including on a hardware
screwdriver-turning task where we show that recovering using our method
improves task performance by 96% and that ours is the only method evaluated
that can attempt recovery without causing catastrophic task failure. Videos can

### [105] [Bring the Apple, Not the Sofa: Impact of Irrelevant Context in Embodied AI Commands on VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07067)
*Daria Pugacheva,Andrey Moskalenko,Denis Shepelev,Andrey Kuznetsov,Vlad Shakhuro,Elena Tutubalina*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study analyzes Vision-Language-Action models’ robustness to linguistic perturbations, showing that irrelevant context and semantically/lexically similar noise severely degrade performance; introduces an LLM-based core-command filtering method that recovers up to 98.5% of original performance under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how real-world linguistic variability affects VLA models, addressing a gap in robustness under paraphrase and context perturbations.

Method: Systematic evaluation with two perturbation types: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) addition of irrelevant context. Irrelevant contexts are categorized by length and their semantic/lexical proximity to commands. Measurements of performance degradation are performed. An LLM-based filtering framework is proposed to extract core commands from noisy inputs, and its effect on restoring performance is evaluated.

Result: Performance degrades as context length increases. Random irrelevant context causes a small drop (<10%). Semantic and lexical similarity of same-length context triggers a substantial decline (~50%). Paraphrasing causes ~20% drop. The filtering framework recovers up to 98.5% of original performance under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: VLA models are variably robust to linguistic perturbations, with noise that is semantically/lexically aligned being particularly damaging. An LLM-based filtering step that extracts core commands can markedly improve robustness, nearly restoring original performance under noisy inputs.

Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models are widely used in Embodied AI, enabling
robots to interpret and execute language instructions. However, their
robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of
the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations.
Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction
noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant
context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to
their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In
this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size
expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to
random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and
lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of
around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To
mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core
commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to
recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comprehensive full-stack survey of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotics, detailing architectures, data strategies, and deployment guidance to enable generalizable robotic policies across tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of holistic, real-world deployment-focused surveys for VLA systems; integrate software and hardware aspects; enable generalization and practical adoption in robotics.

Method: Systematic literature review and synthesis of VLA literature across modalities, tasks, and platforms; taxonomy of architectures, building blocks, processing techniques, and learning paradigms; review of datasets, data collection, augmentation, platforms, and benchmarks; categorization of references by training approach, evaluation method, modality, dataset; provide project website hosting the references.

Result: A full-stack survey with practical deployment guidance and a categorized reference table hosted on the project website.

Conclusion: VLA research can yield generalizable, deployable robotic policies when studied in an integrated, full-stack framework; this survey consolidates the landscape and delivers actionable guidance for real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and
action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA
models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects,
embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to
enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional
task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world
deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action
representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a
comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware
components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic
review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition,
architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and
learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in
real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms,
data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation
methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this
paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying
VLAs to real-world robotic systems. All references categorized by training
approach, evaluation method, modality, and dataset are available in the table

### [107] [Sampling Strategies for Robust Universal Quadrupedal Locomotion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07094)
*David Rytz,Kim Tien Ly,Ioannis Havoutis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A study on sampling strategies for configuration variation to train universal locomotion policies for quadrupeds; compares three approaches to sampling joint PD gains (mass-to-gain mappings, adaptive filtering, and uniform random sampling); finds substantial joint-gain randomization is required to close the sim-to-real gap, with zero-shot hardware transfer to ANYmal after RaiSim training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable a single reinforcement learning policy to generalize over diverse robot configurations and reduce the sim-to-real gap by thorough randomization of physical parameters and joint PD gains.

Method: Three sampling strategies for joint gains and mass: (1) linear and polynomial mappings from mass to gains, (2) performance-based adaptive filtering, (3) uniform random sampling; bias configurations using nominal priors and reference models; train in RaiSim; test on diverse quadruped models; perform zero-shot deployment on the ANYmal robot.

Result: Robustness of the learned policy improves with significant joint PD-gain randomization; the approach shows the necessity of extensive gain randomization to robustly close the sim-to-real gap; validated via zero-shot hardware deployment on ANYmal.

Conclusion: Extensive PD-gain randomization guided by priors and reference models is essential for universal locomotion policies to generalize across configurations and transfer to real hardware; the sampling strategy influences robustness, with randomization playing a key role.

Abstract: This work focuses on sampling strategies of configuration variations for
generating robust universal locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots. We
investigate the effects of sampling physical robot parameters and joint
proportional-derivative gains to enable training a single reinforcement
learning policy that generalizes to multiple parameter configurations. Three
fundamental joint gain sampling strategies are compared: parameter sampling
with (1) linear and polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, (2)
performance-based adaptive filtering, and (3) uniform random sampling. We
improve the robustness of the policy by biasing the configurations using
nominal priors and reference models. All training was conducted on RaiSim,
tested in simulation on a range of diverse quadrupeds, and zero-shot deployed
onto hardware using the ANYmal quadruped robot. Compared to multiple baseline
implementations, our results demonstrate the need for significant joint
controller gains randomization for robust closing of the sim-to-real gap.

### [108] [A Digital Twin Framework for Metamorphic Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems Using Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07133)
*Tony Zhang,Burak Kantarci,Umair Siddique*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A digital twin–driven metamorphic testing framework for autonomous vehicles creates a synchronized virtual replica of the AV system and environment, using AI-based scene generation to produce varied driving conditions. It defines metamorphic relations to test safety and validates in a driving simulator with promising metrics, showing enhanced test coverage and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the safety challenges of self-driving cars, particularly the oracle problem and limited scenario coverage in real-world testing, by enabling scalable, repeatable, and high-fidelity testing.

Method: Build a digital twin simulation of the AV and its environment; use AI-based image generation (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to create diverse driving scenes while preserving core semantics; formulate three metamorphic relations rooted in real-world traffic rules and vehicle behavior; validate in the Udacity self-driving simulator.

Result: Achieves superior safety testing metrics (true positive rate 0.719, F1 score 0.689, precision 0.662) compared to baselines, indicating enhanced test effectiveness and coverage.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that integrating digital twins with AI-powered scenario generation enables scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing for autonomous vehicle safety.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars remains a major challenge due to the
complexity and unpredictability of real-world driving environments. Traditional
testing methods face significant limitations, such as the oracle problem, which
makes it difficult to determine whether a system's behavior is correct, and the
inability to cover the full range of scenarios an autonomous vehicle may
encounter. In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic
testing framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica
of the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital
twin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,
our approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving
scenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental
features, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.
The digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes
can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,
we define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and
vehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving
simulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and
effectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1
score (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This
paper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered
scenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing
solution for autonomous vehicle safety.

### [109] [TrackVLA++: Unleashing Reasoning and Memory Capabilities in VLA Models for Embodied Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07134)
*Jiahang Liu,Yunpeng Qi,Jiazhao Zhang,Minghan Li,Shaoan Wang,Kui Wu,Hanjing Ye,Hong Zhang,Zhibo Chen,Fangwei Zhong,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TrackVLA++ enhances embodied visual tracking by integrating explicit spatial reasoning and long-horizon memory. It uses a Polar-CoT based spatial reasoning module and a Target Identification Memory (TIM) with gated updates, achieving state-of-the-art results and strong zero-shot generalization across egocentric and multi-camera settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied visual tracking (EVT) requires robust handling of occlusions, distractors, and dynamic scenes. Existing language-guided EVT methods lack explicit spatial reasoning and persistent memory, leading to failures in challenging conditions.

Method: Two key modules are introduced: Polar-CoT, a Chain-of-Thought reasoning mechanism that infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction; and Target Identification Memory (TIM), a memory module with a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory and maintain spatiotemporal consistency during occlusions. These are integrated into TrackVLA++ (Vision-Language-Action model).

Result: TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public EVT benchmarks across egocentric and multi-camera settings. On EVT-Bench DT split, it surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12 (units not specified). It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of explicit spatial reasoning (Polar-CoT) and long-horizon memory (TIM) substantially improves robustness and accuracy in embodied visual tracking, with broad generalization to challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins
practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service
assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent
advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured
scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and
effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the
presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we
present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances
embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism
and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a
Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative
position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action
prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update
strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal
consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive
experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on
public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the
challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading
approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong
zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and
occluded scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A terrain-aware humanoid locomotion framework that fuses a blind-vision RL policy with elevation-map guidance, reconstructs depth-based terrain via a cross-attention transformer, and simulates realistic depth data to improve learning efficiency and robustness on diverse terrains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of depth-image end-to-end learning (training inefficiency and sim-to-real gap) and elevation-map methods (sensor reliance, latency, and reduced robustness) by tightly integrating perception, reconstruction, and data realism to enable efficient and generalizable locomotion.

Method: 1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone: uses pre-trained elevation-map perception to guide reinforcement learning with minimal visual input. 2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer: reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images. 3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method: self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize depth observations, achieving realistic data for training.

Result: Demonstrates agile locomotion across diverse terrains on a full-sized humanoid and reports over 30% reduction in terrain reconstruction error due to improved depth data realism and representation.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient policy training with limited data/hardware while preserving essential terrain features for generalization, effectively marrying depth-based and elevation-map approaches for robust legged locomotion.

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot perceptive locomotion have shown
promising progress. However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely
constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and
elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training
efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the
latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems,
resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1)
Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages
pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with
minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which
reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3)
Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray
casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations,
achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination
enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources,
while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We
validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and
adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.

*Fengze Xie,Xiaozhou Fan,Jacob Schuster,Yisong Yue,Morteza Gharib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: End-to-end sensing-to-control pipeline for fixed-wing UAVs using upstream flow sensing, physics-informed learning, and convex allocation; improves force estimation robustness and tracking under gusts and distribution shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable low-speed agility and robust control for fixed-wing UAVs by mitigating near-body aerodynamics, gust disturbances, and partial observability through integrated sensing, learning, and allocation.

Method: Narwhal-inspired upstream multi-hole probes plus wing surface sensors; data-driven calibration mapping pressures to airspeed and flow angles; learn a control-affine dynamics model with estimated airspeed/angles and sparse sensors; symmetry regularizer to improve identifiability; regularized least-squares controller to realize desired wrenches with smooth actuation.

Result: Wing pressures reduce force-estimation error by 25-30%; the learned model degrades ~12% vs 44% under distribution shift (compared to a baseline); force tracking improves with smoother inputs: 27% RMSE reduction in normal force vs plain affine model, 34% vs unstructured baseline.

Conclusion: The integrated sensing-learning-control pipeline yields more accurate force estimation, better robustness to distribution shifts, and smoother actuation, enabling improved, low-speed performance for fixed-wing UAVs; the approach offers a generalizable framework for physics-informed data-driven control.

Abstract: Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer endurance and efficiency but
lack low-speed agility due to highly coupled dynamics. We present an end-to-end
sensing-to-control pipeline that combines bio-inspired hardware,
physics-informed dynamics learning, and convex control allocation. Measuring
airflow on a small airframe is difficult because near-body aerodynamics,
propeller slipstream, control-surface actuation, and ambient gusts distort
pressure signals. Inspired by the narwhal's protruding tusk, we mount in-house
multi-hole probes far upstream and complement them with sparse, carefully
placed wing pressure sensors for local flow measurement. A data-driven
calibration maps probe pressures to airspeed and flow angles. We then learn a
control-affine dynamics model using the estimated airspeed/angles and sparse
sensors. A soft left/right symmetry regularizer improves identifiability under
partial observability and limits confounding between wing pressures and
flaperon inputs. Desired wrenches (forces and moments) are realized by a
regularized least-squares allocator that yields smooth, trimmed actuation.
Wind-tunnel studies across a wide operating range show that adding wing
pressures reduces force-estimation error by 25-30%, the proposed model degrades
less under distribution shift (about 12% versus 44% for an unstructured
baseline), and force tracking improves with smoother inputs, including a 27%
reduction in normal-force RMSE versus a plain affine model and 34% versus an
unstructured baseline.

*Yi Han,Cheng Chi,Enshen Zhou,Shanyu Rong,Jingkun An,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Lu Sheng,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIGeR enables vision-language models to perform precise geometric reasoning by generating and calling external tools for exact computations, bridging perception and robotics with centimeter-level accuracy; it introduces TIGeR-300K for tool invocation training and uses SFT+RFT to achieve state-of-the-art results on geometric benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs excel at perceptual understanding but lack metric/ computational precision necessary for real-world robotics; most approaches treat geometry as pattern recognition and miss depth/calibration cues, hindering centimeter-level manipulation accuracy.

Method: Propose TIGeR framework where the model detects geometric reasoning needs, synthesizes computational code, and invokes specialized libraries/tools for exact calculations. Train with a two-stage pipeline (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning) using a hierarchical reward. Build TIGeR-300K dataset with tool-invocation sequences, including tasks like point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility checks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks, and demonstrates centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Transforming VLMs into geometric computers by outsourcing exact computations to external tools can close the gap between perceptual understanding and precise robotic control; the TIGeR-300K dataset supports tool-based reasoning and paves the way for broader manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial
reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and
lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current
approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera
calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks
that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic
manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel
framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric
computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric
computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize
complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to
recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate
computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To
support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive
tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose

*Aman Singh,Deepak Kapa,Suryank Joshi,Shishir Kolathaya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COMPAct proposes a computational framework to optimize planetary actuator gearboxes (SSPG, CPG, WPG, DSPG) for a given motor, minimizing mass and width while maximizing efficiency, and automating CAD for 3D printing. It analyzes gearbox suitability across gear ratios and validates with two actuators, reporting SSPG: 60–80% efficiency, 0.59° backlash, 242.7 Nm/rad stiffness; CPG: ~60% efficiency, 2.6° backlash, 201.6 Nm/rad stiffness. Code and CAD generation are provided for reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited attention to systematic optimization of gearbox parameters and automated CAD generation for actuator design. A framework that jointly optimizes gearbox selection and supports CAD automation could accelerate design, reduce weight, and improve performance.

Method: Introduce COMPAct framework that optimizes four gearbox types (SSPG, CPG, WPG, DSPG) for a given motor. Objectives: minimize mass and actuator width, maximize efficiency. Automates actuator CAD generation for direct 3D printing. Explores a wide range of gear ratios. Fabricates and experimentally validates two actuator variants (measuring power efficiency, no-load backlash, transmission stiffness).

Result: IDENTified optimal designs across gear ratios and gearbox types; SSPG achieved 60–80% efficiency, 0.59° backlash, 242.7 Nm/rad stiffness; CPG achieved ~60% efficiency, 2.6° backlash, 201.6 Nm/rad stiffness. CAD models for all four gearbox types generated; code and video provided; demonstrates feasibility of automated CAD generation and experimental validation.

Conclusion: COMPAct enables systematic gearbox design optimization for planetary actuators across several gearbox types and gear ratios, with automated CAD generation for rapid prototyping. The results highlight how gearbox type and ratio influence efficiency and stiffness, informing design choices for actuator development.

Abstract: The optimal design of robotic actuators is a critical area of research, yet
limited attention has been given to optimizing gearbox parameters and
automating actuator CAD. This paper introduces COMPAct: Computational
Optimization and Automated Modular Design of Planetary Actuators, a framework
that systematically identifies optimal gearbox parameters for a given motor
across four gearbox types, single-stage planetary gearbox (SSPG), compound
planetary gearbox (CPG), Wolfrom planetary gearbox (WPG), and double-stage
planetary gearbox (DSPG). The framework minimizes mass and actuator width while
maximizing efficiency, and further automates actuator CAD generation to enable
direct 3D printing without manual redesign. Using this framework, optimal
gearbox designs are explored over a wide range of gear ratios, providing
insights into the suitability of different gearbox types across various gear
ratio ranges. In addition, the framework is used to generate CAD models of all
four gearbox types with varying gear ratios and motors. Two actuator types are
fabricated and experimentally evaluated through power efficiency, no-load
backlash, and transmission stiffness tests. Experimental results indicate that
the SSPG actuator achieves a mechanical efficiency of 60-80 %, a no-load
backlash of 0.59 deg, and a transmission stiffness of 242.7 Nm/rad, while the
CPG actuator demonstrates 60 % efficiency, 2.6 deg backlash, and a stiffness of
201.6 Nm/rad. Code available at:

*Donald Pfaffmann,Matthias Klusch,Marcel Steinmetz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid learning-assisted planning framework, HyPlan, for collision-free navigation in partially observable traffic; integrates multi-agent prediction, PPO-based deep reinforcement learning, and approximate online POMDP planning with heuristic confidence-based vertical pruning to boost speed while maintaining safety; evaluated on CARLA-CTS2 showing safer navigation than baselines and significantly faster planning than online POMDP planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving in complex, partially observable traffic requires safe and efficient decision-making under uncertainty. Existing methods often trade safety for speed or rely on single modalities. A hybrid approach that combines prediction, learning, and planning may improve both safety and efficiency.

Method: HyPlan combines (i) multi-agent behavior prediction (to anticipate other agents), (ii) deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO) for policy learning, and (iii) approximated online POMDP planning with heuristic confidence-based vertical pruning to reduce runtime while preserving safety.

Result: On the CARLA-CTS2 benchmark, focusing on critical traffic scenarios with pedestrians, HyPlan navigates more safely than selected relevant baselines and executes significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework that integrates prediction, learning, and planning can enhance safe and efficient autonomous navigation under partial observability. The heuristic vertical pruning appears effective in reducing computation without sacrificing safety; broader validation is needed across more scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid learning-assisted planning method, named HyPlan,
for solving the collision-free navigation problem for self-driving cars in
partially observable traffic environments. HyPlan combines methods for
multi-agent behavior prediction, deep reinforcement learning with proximal
policy optimization and approximated online POMDP planning with heuristic
confidence-based vertical pruning to reduce its execution time without
compromising safety of driving. Our experimental performance analysis on the
CARLA-CTS2 benchmark of critical traffic scenarios with pedestrians revealed
that HyPlan may navigate safer than selected relevant baselines and perform
significantly faster than considered alternative online POMDP planners.

*Altamirano Cabrera Miguel,Sautenkov Oleg,Tirado Jonathan,Fedoseev Aleksey,Kopanev Pavel,Kajimoto Hiroyuki,Tsetserukou Dzmitry*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A CNN-based system improves tilt/position recognition for telemanipulating deformable objects, using a palm haptic device and finger-tactile sensors with a mask-based tactile rendering, boosting user accuracy from 9.67% to 82.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telemanipulating deformable objects (like plastic pipettes) suffers from dynamic shape changes that misalign perception, causing controller errors. Enhanced, precise haptic feedback is needed to convey accurate pose information to users.

Method: A multi-contact haptic device (LinkGlide) provides palm feedback and two tactile sensors in a Robotiq gripper. A CNN infers tilt and position during grasp of deformable objects and outputs a mask that drives multi-contact tactile stimuli presented to the user.

Result: Using the CNN and the preset mask significantly improves tilt/position recognition by users, from 9.67% (direct data) to 82.5%.

Conclusion: CNN-driven tilt/position recognition combined with mask-based tactile rendering can substantially enhance user perception and precision in telemanipulation of deformable objects, indicating the approach's effectiveness and potential for broader adoption.

Abstract: Telemanipulation of deformable objects requires high precision and dexterity
from the users, which can be increased by kinesthetic and tactile feedback.
However, the object shape can change dynamically, causing ambiguous perception
of its alignment and hence errors in the robot positioning. Therefore, the tilt
angle and position classification problem has to be solved to present a clear
tactile pattern to the user. This work presents a telemanipulation system for
plastic pipettes consisting of a multi-contact haptic device LinkGlide to
deliver haptic feedback at the users' palm and two tactile sensors array
embedded in the 2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the tilt and position while
grasping deformable objects. The CNN generates a mask based on recognized tilt
and position data to render further multi-contact tactile stimuli provided to
the user during the telemanipulation. The study has shown that using the CNN
algorithm and the preset mask, tilt, and position recognition by users is
increased from 9.67% using the direct data to 82.5%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A CNN-based tactile decoding approach improves tilt detection and teleoperation success in a robotic telemanipulation system for deformable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable objects deform during grasping, causing perceptual ambiguity and positioning errors; tactile feedback is essential to improve precision and dexterity in telemanipulation.

Method: A telemanipulation setup uses a Force Dimension Omega.7 haptic device with electro-tactile arrays and tactile sensors on a Robotiq gripper. A CNN detects tilt of deformable objects and generates tactile patterns to drive electro-tactile stimuli, enabling haptic feedback during telemanipulation.

Result: Tilt recognition accuracy improved from 23.13% (downsized data) to 57.9%; teleoperation success rate increased from 53.12% to 92.18% when using CNN-generated tactile patterns.

Conclusion: The CNN-based decoding and haptic rendering approach enhances perception and execution in telemanipulation of deformable objects, demonstrating a notable improvement in both recognition and control performance.

Abstract: The shape of deformable objects can change drastically during grasping by
robotic grippers, causing an ambiguous perception of their alignment and hence
resulting in errors in robot positioning and telemanipulation. Rendering clear
tactile patterns is fundamental to increasing users' precision and dexterity
through tactile haptic feedback during telemanipulation. Therefore, different
methods have to be studied to decode the sensors' data into haptic stimuli.
This work presents a telemanipulation system for plastic pipettes that consists
of a Force Dimension Omega.7 haptic interface endowed with two
electro-stimulation arrays and two tactile sensor arrays embedded in the
2-finger Robotiq gripper. We propose a novel approach based on convolutional

electro-tactile stimuli provided to the user during the telemanipulation. The

increased from 23.13\% with the downsized data to 57.9%, and the success rate

TL;DR: AlphaApollo is a self-evolving, tool-augmented reasoning system that uses computation and retrieval tools to perform deliberate, verifiable reasoning, yielding significant performance gains on AIME benchmarks across multiple foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome foundation-models’ two bottlenecks: insufficient intra-model reasoning capacity and unreliable test-time iteration, by enabling deliberate tool-assisted reasoning and iterative, multi-model refinement.

Method: Orchestrates a computation tool (Python with numerical and symbolic libraries) and a retrieval tool to perform exact calculations and ground decisions. Supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative refinement.

Tool-use analysis: >80% of tool calls successfully executed; AlphaApollo outperforms non-tool baselines. More results and details will be available at GitHub.

Conclusion: AlphaApollo consistently raises the capability ceiling of foundation models by enabling tool-assisted, deliberate reasoning; ongoing empirical results and implementation details will be published on GitHub.

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical

further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool
calls are successfully executed, with consistent outperformance of non-tool

*Mohammad Mahdi Samiei Paqaleh,Arash Marioriyad,Arman Tahmasebi-Zadeh,Mohamadreza Fereydooni,Mahdi Ghaznavai,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Complexity OoD generalization as a framework to define and measure reasoning by the minimal required solution complexity, combining representational and computational steps; introduces Kolmogorov complexity and practical proxies, distinguishes from other OoD notions, and outlines architectural/training recommendations to allocate computation by complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no clear, consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability in AI systems, despite formal notions for learning generalization and OoD. The authors aim to formalize and unify learning and reasoning under a Complexity OoD lens to enable robust, stepwise reasoning evaluation and progress.

Method: Define Complexity OoD via the minimal solution complexity required to solve a test instance, using representational and computational complexity proxies (e.g., object/relation counts, reasoning step counts) and Kolmogorov complexity as a formal basis. Distinguish from length and compositional OoD. Provide practical recommendations for benchmarking, supervision targeting solution traces, inductive biases, and addressing spillovers that hinder complexity-based generalization.

Result: A theoretical framework and set of practical recommendations for evaluating and fostering reasoning under complexity pressure. The framework links System1/System2 processing to complexity, clarifies how to design benchmarks, supervision, and inductive biases to promote Complexity OoD generalization, and argues that scaling data alone cannot achieve robust reasoning without models and training regimes that allocate computation according to solution complexity.

Conclusion: Progress toward robust reasoning requires explicit modeling of computation and its allocation with respect to complexity; architectures and training strategies must be designed to handle Complexity OoD rather than relying solely on scaling data.

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

### [119] [BuilderBench -- A benchmark for generalist agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06288)
*Raj Ghugare,Catherine Ji,Kathryn Wantlin,Jin Schofield,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BuilderBench proposes a hardware-accelerated, open-ended exploration benchmark for agent pre-training where agents must learn to build 42 target structures with blocks; current methods struggle, and the authors provide a training-wheels protocol and six reference algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond mimicry and data-driven learning, enabling scalable, interaction-based learning that can handle novel problems through embodied exploration and long-horizon planning.

Method: A hardware-accelerated simulator of a robotic agent interacting with blocks; a task-suite with 42 diverse target structures test physics, mathematics, and planning; unsupervised learning during training and evaluation on unseen targets; a training-wheels protocol; six reference algorithms implemented in a single-file baseline.

Result: Experiments indicate that many tasks challenge current algorithms; the benchmark reveals gaps and provides baseline methods and protocols to accelerate progress in learning through interaction and embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: BuilderBench is positioned as a practical tool to catalyze research on embodied, exploration-driven pre-training, offering environment, tasks, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations.

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

### [120] [Requirements for Game-Based Learning Design Framework for Information System Integration in the Context of Post-Merger Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06302)
*Ksenija Lace,Marite Kirikova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a game-based learning framework to teach AMILI/AMILP methods for information system integration in post-merger contexts, addressing the high learning curve and low learner motivation, with a plan for iterative design and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-merger information system integration is complex and under-supported by targeted training. AMILI/AMILP have shown high learning curves and low motivation in practice, creating a need for engaging, theory-grounded training frameworks.

Method: Literature-informed synthesis of foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation models, and serious game design frameworks to derive essential requirements for a game-based learning framework. The requirements are organized into two components: the transformation process (how to convert the static methods into game-based content) and the resulting learning experience (what learners should achieve and how motivation is maintained).

Result: Identifies essential requirements and outlines a game-based learning framework tailored to IS integration in PMI; provides a plan for iterative design and real-world validation to develop and evaluate the approach.

Conclusion: A tailored game-based learning design framework is feasible for IS integration in post-merger contexts and can address learning curve and motivation issues, contingent on iterative development and empirical validation in real-world settings.

Abstract: Post-merger integration states unique challenges for professionals
responsible for information system integration aimed on alignment and
combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

*Wentao Deng,Jiahuan Pei,Zhiwei Xu,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen,Pengjie Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theoretical framework and BCCS method selects optimal collaborators and calibrates consensus via internal beliefs to stabilize multi-agent consensus in NLP, yielding improved accuracy on MATH and MMLU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consensus in multi-agent NLP systems is often destabilized by internal contradictions and indiscriminate collaboration; there is a need for selective collaboration and belief-aware calibration to achieve stable, accurate outcomes.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework to select optimal collaborators that maximize consensus stability; propose Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework implementing optimal collaboration and calibration using system-internal beliefs; validate with experiments on MATH and MMLU.

Result: BCCS outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% accuracy on MATH and 3.95% accuracy on MMLU.

Conclusion: BCCS provides a principled approach to stable consensus in MAS for NLP by optimizing collaborator selection and calibrating judgments with internal beliefs; code is available online.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

### [122] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Off-trajectory reasoning capabilities are not guaranteed by standard solo training; the study proposes twin tests (Recoverability and Guidability) to evaluate whether LLMs can backtrack from distractions and build on collaborators' correct reasoning. Across 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B–32B), stronger models show greater fragility to distraction, and all models struggle to leverage guiding steps, with solve rates below 9.2%. Distillation effects can transfer suboptimal recoverability from teachers to students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable productive multi-model collaboration in shared reasoning trajectories by testing whether solo-trained LLMs can recover from distractions (Recoverability) and be guided by stronger collaborators (Guidability); and to understand how training choices shape these off-trajectory behaviors.

Method: Introduce two tests—Recoverability and Guidability—that probe backtracking from misleading traces and the ability to build on correct steps from collaborators. Evaluate 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B–32B). Perform control studies varying distillation teacher, reinforcement learning (RL) usage, and data selection to isolate factors influencing off-trajectory behavior.

Result: Stronger LLMs on benchmarks are often more fragile under distraction. All models tested fail to effectively leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their capabilities (solve rates < 9.2%). Distillation transfers suboptimal recoverability behaviors from teacher models to distilled students, even when distillation trajectories themselves are correct.

Conclusion: The work provides an evaluation framework for multi-model collaborations in shared reasoning trajectories and highlights limitations of off-the-shelf reasoning LLMs. It offers actionable insights for training native reasoning collaborators and cautions that suboptimal recoverability in teachers can propagate to students, underscoring the need for targeted training to enable recoverability and guidability.

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes a machine-readable knowledge graph linking food flavonoids (USDA) and cancer literature using KNARM, to explore diet–health relationships; presents a groundwork with plans for expansion and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in "food as medicine" has outpaced standardized, machine-readable representations; a semantic-web approach could unify diverse data sources to better leverage dietary-health knowledge.

Method: Construct a knowledge graph by integrating flavonoid contents from USDA databases with cancer associations found in literature, using the KNARM methodology to represent relationships in a machine-operable format.

Result: A proposed knowledge graph is presented as a working example for researchers, enabling exploration of the interplay between diet and disease management by linking food data to cancer-related literature.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for linking foods and health outcomes; future work includes expanding data, capturing nuances, and performing inferences to uncover hidden relationships.

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzlePlex is a new benchmark to test foundation models’ reasoning and planning in diverse, dynamic puzzles. It reveals that instruction-based reasoning models excel, while code-based execution, though harder, offers scalable efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how foundation models reason and plan in complex, dynamic environments as they scale, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that are limited in diversity and extensibility.

Method: Design PuzzlePlex with 15 puzzle types (deterministic/stochastic; single-player/two-player), provide a comprehensive, extensible environment for each game, implement customized baseline strategies, develop fine-grained performance metrics, and compare frontier models in two settings: instruction-based and code-based, while studying scaling limits.

Result: Instruction-based settings see reasoning models outperform others; code-based execution is more challenging but provides a scalable and efficient alternative; PuzzlePlex enables targeted evaluation and deeper understanding of generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex is a valuable benchmark for evaluating reasoning, planning, and generalization of foundation models and can guide future improvements as models evolve and scale.

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and

### [125] [Beneficial Reasoning Behaviors in Agentic Search and Effective Post-training to Obtain Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06534)
*Jiahe Jin,Abhijay Paladugu,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Behavior Priming for agentic search, identifying four reasoning behaviors and showing SFT+RL yields large gains; emphasizes learning from reasoning behaviors rather than final answer correctness; plans open-source release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve agentic search with LLMs interacting with retrieval systems and the web by instilling explicit, beneficial reasoning behaviors that enhance exploration, planning, and robustness in multi-step information-seeking tasks.

Method: 1) Develop a reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study agentic search; 2) analyze successful trajectories to identify four beneficial behaviors (Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, Error Recovery); 3) synthesize trajectories exhibiting these behaviors (Behavior Priming); 4) train models via supervised fine-tuning on these trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning; 5) evaluate on GAIA, WebWalker, and HLE benchmarks; 6) compare to RL-only baselines.

Result: Behavior Priming yields over 35% gains for Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared with RL-only training; the benefit arises from the presence of desirable reasoning behaviors in the SFT data rather than final answer correctness; these behaviors boost exploration (higher pass@k and entropy) and enable longer trajectories, providing a strong foundation for RL.

Conclusion: Quality of reasoning behaviors in training data is crucial for effective agentic search and RL performance. The work suggests shifting data curation toward behavior-focused trajectories to improve long-horizon planning and exploration in LLM agents, with open-source code to be released.

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

### [126] [Auto-Prompt Ensemble for LLM Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06538)
*Jiajie Li,Huayi Zhang,Peng Lin,Jinjun Xiong,Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An adaptive framework APE that learns evaluation dimensions from failures to improve LLM judges via a confidence-based ensemble and Collective Confidence; shows improved agreement (GPT-4o) on Reward Bench, zero-shot, by leveraging test-time computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM judges often miss implicit human evaluation standards; there is a need to discover latent evaluation dimensions and reliably combine them to align with human judgments.

Method: Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE) automatically learns auxiliary evaluation dimensions from failure cases, and uses a confidence-based ensemble with Collective Confidence to decide when to adopt judgments from additional dimensions; enables test-time computation to improve reliability of LLM Judge.

Result: APE improves GPT-4o agreement on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in zero-shot, and demonstrates stronger reliability across diverse benchmarks by leveraging multiple evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: APE provides a principled framework to enhance LLM Judge reliability by discovering and ensembling latent evaluation dimensions with a confidence-based mechanism and test-time computation, narrowing the gap between human and LLM judgments.

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

### [127] [WebDART: Dynamic Decomposition and Re-planning for Complex Web Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06587)
*Jingbo Yang,Bairu Hou,Wei Wei,Shiyu Chang,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART enables a single LLM to handle complex web tasks by dynamically decomposing objectives into navigation, information extraction, and execution, with replanning as new pages appear; it improves performance on hard tasks while maintaining simpler-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM web agents perform well on straightforward tasks but struggle with long-horizon navigation, large-scale information extraction, and constraint reasoning; a unified, adaptive framework is needed.

Method: Iteratively decompose each objective into three focused subtasks (navigation, information extraction, execution); continuously replan as new webpages reveal filters/shortcuts; focus on one skill at a time to reduce redundant exploration.

Result: Achieves up to 13.7 percentage-point higher success rates vs state-of-the-art on WebChoreArena; matches performance on the simpler WebArena; reduces required navigation steps by up to 14.7.

Conclusion: Structured decomposition and dynamic replanning enable LLM agents to tackle complex web tasks more effectively and efficiently, extending capabilities beyond simple web interactions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

### [128] [Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06600)
*Zhaochun Ren,Zhou Yang,Chenglong Ye,Haizhou Sun,Chao Chen,Xiaofei Zhu,Xiangwen Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EICL improves fine-grained emotion recognition by aligning query representations with emotionally meaningful prototypes using dynamic soft-labels and a two-stage similarity exclusion, outperforming standard ICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL relies on resemblance-based query representations tied to emotion prototypes; semantically similar examples can introduce emotional inconsistencies, degrading decision-making. The paper aims to optimize the decision-making stage via prototype-based reasoning.

Method: Adopts emotion-focused prototype theory within ICL, introduces dynamic soft-labeling to better reflect emotional nuance, uses emotionally similar examples, and employs a two-stage exclusion strategy to assess similarity from multiple angles, enhancing decision-making in emotion inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show that EICL significantly outperforms standard ICL on multiple emotion datasets.

Conclusion: EICL strengthens fine-grained emotion recognition by aligning representations with emotional prototypes and by refining decision-making, suggesting broader applicability to other reasoning tasks that rely on prototype-based comparisons.

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AITL introduces a live, continuous data flywheel for LLM-based customer support by embedding four types of agent-in-the-loop feedback into operations, achieving faster improvements and better metrics than offline retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome long offline retraining cycles and batch annotation limitations by integrating human feedback into live workflows to continuously improve system performance and adoption.

Method: Four feedback signals integrated into live operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, (4) missing knowledge identification; feedback updates models, reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks; production pilot with US-based agents.

Result: Retrieval accuracy improved: recall@75 +11.7%; precision@8 +14.8%; generation quality 'helpfulness' +8.4%; agent adoption +4.5%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of embedding human-in-the-loop feedback in operational workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support, reducing retraining cycles and improving performance.

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

### [130] [Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06711)
*Batu El,Mert Yuksekgonul,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study reveals three main findings: (1) simply aggregating all prior agent designs across iterations underperforms compared to ignoring prior designs, and an evolutionary approach helps; (2) despite training multiple agents, test-time usage is usually a single agent with low behavioral diversity; (3) automated design is only economically advantageous on two datasets with large deployment scales; for others, gains don't justify costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the viability and limitations of automating the design of agentic systems (meta-agents) by examining learning across iterations, behavioral diversity, and cost-effectiveness across datasets.

Method: Empirical analysis of a common class of meta-agents: compare context-expansion with ignoring priors, assess the diversity of designed agents, and conduct cost-benefit/economics analysis across datasets at deployment scales (e.g., >15k examples).

Result: 1) Expanding context with all previous agents worsens performance compared with ignoring prior designs; an evolutionary approach yields better results. 2) Training yields multiple agents, but test-time usage is typically a single agent with low behavioral diversity, limiting complementary use. 3) Economic viability is limited: only two datasets show that automated design plus deployment is cheaper than human-designed agents at large scale; for other datasets, design gains do not justify costs.

Conclusion: Automated meta-agent design is not universally advantageous. Success hinges on learning strategy (avoiding naive context accumulation, embracing evolutionary methods), ensuring behavioral diversity among agents for potential complementarity, and achieving sufficient dataset scale to offset the design costs.

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

*Ali Sarabadani,Kheirolah Rahsepar Fard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiCNKG fuses CNKG, GO, and DO via LLMs to form a unified biomedical KG linking genes, diseases, and cognitive processes; shows strong metrics and potential for personalized medicine and cognitive neuroscience applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome fragmentation and limited semantic capture in traditional ML by integrating multiple biomedical knowledge graphs with LLM-assisted alignment to enable richer reasoning across molecular to cognitive domains.

Method: Entity alignment and semantic similarity via large language models (e.g., GPT-4) across CNKG, GO, DO, followed by graph augmentation to produce a cohesive KG with 6.9k nodes, 11.3k edges, 5 node types and 7 edge types. Link prediction evaluated using TransE and RotatE against benchmarks.

Result: Key metrics: precision 85.20%, recall 87.30%, coverage 92.18%, graph consistency 82.50%, novelty detection 40.28%, expert validation 89.50%. Link prediction: TransE MR 391, MRR 0.411; RotatE MR 263, MRR 0.395; competitive with FB15k-237 and WN18RR.

Conclusion: The integrated MultiCNKG enables multi-layered insights from molecules to behavior, supporting applications in personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis generation in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method and toolchain for verifying LLM-based policies in memoryless MDPs by incrementally building the reachable MDP from LLM actions and checking safety with Storm, showing limited but feasible verification on grid worlds using Ollama; useful for benchmarking but below deep RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safety and correctness of LLM-driven policies in sequential decision tasks by providing a formal verification workflow that integrates LLMs with model checking, addressing concerns about unsafe or unpredictable LLM behavior in decision processes.

Method: Iteratively construct the reachable portion of an MDP guided by the LLM's actions. Represent each state as a natural language prompt, parse the LLM's response into actions, and expand reachable successor states accordingly. Form a formal model and verify it against a PCTL safety property using Storm. The pipeline integrates with Ollama for open-source LLMs and supports PRISM-specified tasks.

Result: Experiments on standard grid world benchmarks show that open-source LLMs accessed through Ollama can be verified when deterministically seeded, but overall performance lags deep reinforcement learning baselines.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical, verifiable framework for LLM-based policies in sequential tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking and paving the way for formally verifying increasingly capable LLMs, albeit with current limitations compared to deep RL on performance.

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

*Zhi Zhang,Yan Liu,Zhejing Hu,Gong Chen,Sheng-hua Zhong,Jiannong Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Double-Loop Multi-Agent (DLMA) framework automates end-to-end scientific research using a leader loop to evolve research plans and a follower loop to execute them, achieving state-of-the-art automated evaluation and showing both loops are essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating scientific research is hard due to the need for novel, sound high-level plans and robust execution under dynamics and uncertainty; a bilevel approach is proposed to address this challenge.

Method: A DLMA framework with a leader loop (professor agents) that uses an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and integration meetings to generate/refine a pool of research proposals; and a follower loop (doctoral student agents) that executes the best plan and dynamically adjusts it via pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring steps like drafting and coding are supported by context and observations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show DLMA achieves state-of-the-art automated evaluation scores and outperforms strong baselines; ablation studies confirm both loops are critical, with evolution driving novelty and execution ensuring soundness.

Conclusion: DLMA can effectively balance novelty and soundness in automated research by decoupling planning and execution into two interacting loops; both loops contribute critically to performance.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental
challenge: it requires both evolving high-level plans that are novel and sound,
and executing these plans correctly amidst dynamic and uncertain conditions. To
address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent
(DLMA) framework to solve the given research problem automatically. The leader
loop, composed of professor agents, is responsible for evolving research plans.
It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and
integration meetings to iteratively generate and refine a pool of research
proposals, exploring the solution space effectively. The follower loop,
composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autoformalizer with Tool Feedback (ATF) uses compiler-based syntax checks and multi-LLMs-for-judge for semantic consistency to improve autoformalization; with training phases (cold-start, expert iteration) and Direct Preference Optimization, it outperforms baselines, scales well, and a 750k-sample dataset (Numina-ATF) is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of data for Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) and instability of formalizers in producing syntactically valid and semantically consistent statements; need for iterative, tool-guided refinement.

Method: Integrate Lean 4 compiler as a syntax-corrector; employ multi-LLMs-as-judge to validate semantic consistency; train via cold-start on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase, and Direct Preference Optimization to improve revisions.

Result: ATF substantially outperforms baseline formalizers; human evaluations corroborate; demonstrates strong inference scaling; releases Numina-ATF with 750k synthetic formal statements to support autoformalization/ATP research.

Conclusion: Tool-feedback-guided formalization improves syntactic validity and semantic consistency, offering a robust approach for autoformalization and advancing ATP research, complemented by a valuable large synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TGPR merges policy-gradient-based refinement with Thompson-sampling tree search to actively explore refinement paths in LLMs, improving stateful reasoning and iterative refinement performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative refinement faces an enormous search space and relies on predefined heuristics that struggle with exploration-exploitation and adaptation to past outcomes.

Method: TGPR combines GRPO with a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search to actively explore both failed and successful refinement paths, enabling denser training trajectories and more adaptive policies on benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, APPS).

Result: Outperforms a competitive GRPO baseline, achieving up to +4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 on MBPP and up to +12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 on APPS, demonstrating a principled integration of learned policies with structured search.

Conclusion: TGPR offers a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and stateful reasoning in LLMs by coupling learned policies with structured search, with potential applicability beyond code debugging.

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An IDE for AJAN multi-agent systems using RDF/RDFS/OWL, Behavior Trees, and SPARQL, addressing URI and SPARQL learning hurdles, and integrating Large Language Models to aid agent engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hurdles in AJAN agent modeling: URIs are error-prone due to typos; SPARQL queries are complex and have a steep learning curve in large-scale environments; there is a need for tooling to lower these barriers and broaden the user community.

Method: Propose an integrated development environment (IDE) for AJAN agents that streamlines RDF/RDFS/OWL usage, provides behavior modeling via Behavior Trees, and facilitates SPARQL access and manipulation. The IDE also incorporates Large Language Models to assist in agent engineering and reduce the learning curve.

Result: The abstract does not report empirical results. It presents the design and feasibility of an IDE and LLM-assisted tooling to overcome the stated hurdles.

Conclusion: An IDE for AJAN with LLM support is proposed to simplify agent modeling, encourage correct URI usage and SPARQL practices, and broaden AJAN adoption by enabling easier, AI-assisted agent engineering.

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

### [137] [Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06953)
*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Entropy-based stepwise information density (UID) for LLM reasoning traces; step-level uniformity correlates with reasoning quality and improves performance, notably 10-32% relative gains on AIME2025; correct traces show smooth information flow, incorrect traces have spikes; UID-based measures outperform other internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether step-level information stability, as framed by the UID hypothesis, can serve as a diagnostic and selection criterion for high-quality reasoning traces in LLMs, and to quantify its relation to reasoning accuracy.

Method: Define an entropy-based stepwise information density metric. Compute local and global uniformity scores across six reasoning benchmarks. Use UID-based selections to pick traces with more uniform information density. Compare against baselines and analyze spike patterns in correct vs. incorrect traces.

Result: Step-level uniformity improves accuracy, with relative gains of 10-32% on AIME2025 when selecting more uniform traces. Correct traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes; incorrect traces exhibit irregular bursts. UID-based measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality.

Conclusion: UID-inspired information density uniformity is a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems; promoting step-level uniformity can meaningfully enhance reasoning performance.

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

*Wenxun Wu,Yuanyang Li,Guhan Chen,Linyue Wang,Hongyang Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAPO combines multi-hop reasoning with adaptive tool calling using a modified DAPO framework, introducing TAPO-easy-60K and TAPO-hard-18K datasets; shows state-of-the-art results for knowledge-intensive and computational tasks on Qwen models with efficient tool usage and reduced reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of pure inference LLMs in tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge and external computation, by integrating dynamic tool usage (search APIs, Python interpreters) into RL-based reasoning.

Method: Propose TAPO framework, adapting Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization to tool invocation; train and evaluate on TAPO-easy/hard datasets; test on Qwen2.5-3B and -7B; analyze tool call efficiency and reward hacking mitigation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring external knowledge and mathematical computation among similarly-parameterized methods; demonstrates more efficient tool utilization and reduces excessive tool calls due to reward hacking.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented policy optimization effectively combines advanced reasoning with on-demand tool usage, enhancing performance on knowledge-intensive and computation-heavy tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

### [139] [Prompt Optimization Across Multiple Agents for Representing Diverse Human Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07064)
*Manh Hung Nguyen,Sebastian Tschiatschek,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a submodular-optimization driven framework to construct multiple LLM agents, each guided by few-shot demonstrations, to model diverse human perspectives; selects a representative subset efficiently; experiments show improved diversity representation over baselines and patterns aligned with target populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human data is costly and diverse; single LLM agents tend to be homogeneous; need a scalable approach to capture population heterogeneity; use submodular optimization to select diverse agents with guarantees.

Method: Create multiple agents by conditioning LLMs on small sets of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) via in-context learning; formalize agent selection as a submodular optimization problem; derive trade-offs between time complexity and performance guarantees; validate in crowdsourcing and educational domains; analyze behavior to show alignment with target students/annotators.

Result: The selected agent sets better represent human populations than baselines; agents reproduce observed behavior patterns and perspectives.

Conclusion: A scalable framework for representing population diversity in tasks via a curated ensemble of LLM agents; potential to improve modeling of human-like responses in domains requiring diverse viewpoints.

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

*Hongbo Hu,Yisong Wang,Yi Huang,Kewen Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces inductive learning for possibilistic logic programs under stable models by defining induction tasks and two algorithms (ilpsm, ilpsmmin); provides implementation and shows competitive performance against a major ILP system on randomly generated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap: inductive reasoning for poss-programs under stable models has not been studied; need methods to extract poss-programs from a background program and examples that describe intended possibilistic stable models.

Method: Formally define induction tasks; develop two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin to compute induction solutions; implement ilpsmmin; evaluate with experiments comparing against a major inductive learning system on randomly generated datasets.

Result: Algorithms yield induction solutions; ilpsmmin implemented; prototype outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from stable models on the randomly generated datasets.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of inductive learning for poss-programs under stable models; promising performance and a foundation for further development, with scope for broader testing and optimization.

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

*André Hottung,Federico Berto,Chuanbo Hua,Nayeli Gast Zepeda,Daniel Wetzel,Michael Römer,Haoran Ye,Davide Zago,Michael Poli,Stefano Massaroli,Jinkyoo Park,Kevin Tierney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VRPAgent uses LLM-generated, problem-specific operators embedded in a generic metaheuristic and refined with a genetic search to discover powerful VRP heuristics. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple VRP variants using only a single CPU core.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs alone struggle to craft competitive hand-crafted heuristics for VRPs; automating heuristic discovery within a correct and efficient search framework could yield superior, scalable strategies and reduce manual crafting effort.

Method: LLM generates problem-specific operators; these operators are integrated into a generic metaheuristic framework; a novel genetic search refines and combines operators; evaluated on capacitated VRP, VRP with time windows, and prize-collecting VRP; runs on a single CPU core.

Result: The discovered operators outperform handcrafted heuristics and recent learning-based approaches across multiple VRP variants, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: This work represents the first LLM-based paradigm that advances state-of-the-art in VRPs and suggests a promising direction for automated discovery of effective VRP heuristics.

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

### [142] [The Cognitive Bandwidth Bottleneck: Shifting Long-Horizon Agent from Planning with Actions to Planning with Schemas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07091)
*Baixuan Xu,Tianshi Zheng,Zhaowei Wang,Hong Ting Tsang,Weiqi Wang,Tianqing Fang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study compares two action representations for long-horizon LLM planning: conventional planning with actions (PwA) and planning with schemas (PwS). Introduces a cognitive bandwidth framework, reveals an action-space inflection point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), and shows how model capacity and PwS design shift this point. Finds PwS currently suboptimal but offers guidelines to improve scalable autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon autonomy in open-world settings requires scalable action representations as environment action spaces expand. PwA becomes impractical in combinatorial spaces; PwS offers a concise, human-aligned representation but its practical performance and scalability require evaluation and guidance.

Method: Systematic comparison of PwA and PwS; development of a cognitive bandwidth perspective to understand representation differences; empirical identification of an action-space inflection point across environments with different action counts; controlled experiments varying model capacity and PwS instantiation; analysis using ALFWorld and SciWorld.

Result: Identified an action-space inflection point: ~35 actions in ALFWorld vs ~500 actions in SciWorld. Stronger planning ability shifts the inflection point to the right, while better PwS instantiation shifts it left, affecting scalability. PwS agents underperform relative to PwA in current setups, but the study provides actionable design guidance to enhance PwS for scalable autonomy.

Conclusion: Action representation choice matters as action spaces scale. PwS holds promise for scalable, open-world autonomy but requires targeted improvements; the cognitive bandwidth lens helps determine when to adopt PwA or PwS and guides the development of more capable PwS agents.

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

### [143] [The Contingencies of Physical Embodiment Allow for Open-Endedness and Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07117)
*Leonardo Christov-Moore,Arthur Juliani,Alex Kiefer,Nicco Reggente,B. Scott Rousse,Adam Safron,Nicol'as Hinrichs,Daniel Polani,Antonio Damasio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines Heideggerian embodiment conditions (being-in-the-world, being-towards-death) and Nietzschean will-to-power to formulate intrinsic drives (homeostatic and empowerment) within RL to foster open-endedness and care in multi-agent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artificial agents struggle with physical vulnerability and mortality; biological organisms thrive in open-ended environments. The paper aims to understand the role of life's conditions, via existential phenomenology, to build more robust, adaptive, and caring AI.

Method: A theoretical reinforcement-learning formalization that (i) imposes minimal embodied conditions inspired by Heidegger, (ii) derives two intrinsic drives—homeostatic maintenance and empowerment—to maximize future control and longevity, and (iii) analyzes learning in open-ended multi-agent environments to foster open-endedness and care.

Result: Conceptual framework and theoretical analysis proposing intrinsic drives grounded in existential concepts; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Intrinsic drives grounded in being-in-the-world and mortality considerations can promote robust, adaptive, and caring embodied agents; suggests a path for RL research to integrate embodiment, mortality, and open-endedness to enhance AI alignment and adaptability.

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

### [144] [Integrating Domain Knowledge into Process Discovery Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07161)
*Ali Norouzifar,Humam Kourani,Marcus Dees,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An interactive framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract declarative domain rules from natural-language descriptions and guides a process-discovery algorithm to combine event logs with domain knowledge, improving reliability of discovered models; implemented as a tool and evaluated with multiple LLMs and a real-case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event logs are often incomplete or noisy and the domain knowledge that could improve model reliability is usually ignored. Incorporating domain knowledge into process discovery can produce more trustworthy models for conformance checking and improvement.

Method: LLMs extract declarative rules from textual domain descriptions. These rules guide the IMr discovery algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by integrating evidence from the event log with the extracted rules. The workflow coordinates interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and backend services, and a fully implemented tool supports this workflow. The approach is evaluated across multiple LLMs and prompt-engineering strategies, including a case study with domain experts.

Result: An extensive evaluation of several LLMs and prompt strategies is reported. The framework is fully implemented and tested, including a real-life event-log case study where domain experts assessed usability and effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating natural-language domain knowledge via LLMs to guide process discovery can help avoid invalid or undesirable structures and improves the reliability of discovered models for downstream tasks; the work demonstrates the viability of interactive, knowledge-informed process discovery tools.

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NewtonBench introduces a scalable benchmark with 324 tasks across 12 physics domains, using metaphysical shifts to study discovery in interactive, noisy environments and reveals fragile, context-sensitive LLM discovery abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks force a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and memorization resistance and treat discovery as static function fitting rather to the authentic interactive scientific process.

Method: Design NewtonBench with systematic metaphysical shifts of canonical laws to generate many scalable, memorization-resistant tasks; evaluate agents on interactive experiments probing simulated systems to uncover hidden laws.

Result: LLMs show discovery capabilities that are fragile and degrade with system complexity and observational noise; tool assistance (e.g., code interpreters) can paradoxically hinder advanced models by causing premature exploitation and satisficing.

Conclusion: NewtonBench offers a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic testbed for measuring progress toward genuine scientific discovery, guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of interactive, embodied scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

*Pulkit Rustagi,Kyle Hollins Wray,Sandhya Saisubramanian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search (LCBS) for MO-MAPF that directly optimizes a lexicographic preference over multiple objectives, avoiding Pareto-frontier construction and enabling scalability to many objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MO-MAPF methods typically compute Pareto frontiers and do not explicitly optimize user-defined preferences; they also scale poorly as the number of objectives increases.

Method: Propose a lexicographic framework and the LCBS algorithm, which integrates a priority-aware low-level A* search with conflict-based search to produce a single solution aligned with a lexicographic order over objectives, avoiding Pareto frontier construction.

Result: LCBS computes optimal MO-MAPF solutions and scales to instances with up to ten objectives, outperforming baselines on standard and randomized MAPF benchmarks, with higher success rates as the number of objectives grows.

Conclusion: LCBS enables efficient, preference-guided MO-MAPF planning and improves both scalability and solution quality relative to Pareto-frontier approaches.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

TL;DR: A generative-AI NL query workflow with semantic caching for NFL video retrieval achieves high accuracy and large time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline media research and content discovery by replacing filter-and-click interfaces with natural-language queries, enabling faster access to historical NFL plays.

Method: An agentic NL query pipeline that decomposes a user query into elements and translates them into the underlying database query language, augmented by semantic caching to boost accuracy and reduce latency, integrated with an NFL video repository.

Result: Achieves over 95% accuracy and reduces the time to find relevant videos from 10 minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing operational efficiency.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the practicality of generative-AI–driven query workflows for media content management and suggests potential for broader adoption, especially with effective caching and NL-to-query translation.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.

*Khartik Uppalapati,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-guided diffusion model RareGraph-Synth generates privacy-preserving synthetic EHR trajectories for ultra-rare diseases by integrating a large biomedical knowledge graph into the diffusion process, improving fidelity and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for realistic yet private data for ultra-rare diseases; existing methods struggle with fidelity and privacy; leveraging biomedical structure to guide diffusion can align generation with domain constraints.

Method: Unifies Orphanet/Orphadata, HPO, the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and FAERS into an 8M-edge heterogeneous knowledge graph; meta-path scores modulate the forward stochastic differential equation noise; reverse denoiser yields timestamped lab-code/med-code/adverse-event-triplet sequences without PHI; evaluated on simulated cohorts, compared to unguided diffusion and GAN baselines; privacy assessment via DOMIAS attacker.

Result: Lower maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) by ~40% relative to unguided diffusion and by >60% versus GANs; preserves downstream predictive utility; membership-inference AUROC ~0.53 (below the 0.55 safe-release threshold) vs ~0.61±0.03 for non-KG baselines, indicating strong resistance to re-identification.

Conclusion: Integrating biomedical knowledge graphs into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance data fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research.

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

*Nian Ran,Zhongzheng Li,Yue Wang,Qingsong Ran,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Shikun Feng,Richard Allmendinger,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid co-evolution framework (MCCE) combines a frozen closed-source LLM with a trainable lightweight model to tackle multi-objective discrete optimization (e.g., molecular design). By maintaining a trajectory memory and jointly updating the small model via reinforcement learning, the two models complement each other, achieving state-of-the-art Pareto fronts and outperforming baselines without distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-objective discrete optimization in molecular design involves vast, unstructured search spaces and risk of local optima. Expert knowledge and priors from LLMs can guide exploration, while learning from past searches improves convergence. Closed-source LLMs cannot update parameters, and small open models lack broad knowledge. A hybrid setup aims to harness strengths of both.

Method: Propose Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE): a hybrid framework pairing a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable model. It maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes. The small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning. The two models support and complement global exploration—LLM provides knowledge-driven exploration; the trainable model offers experience-driven adaptation. Unlike distillation, both models improve through mutual inspiration. Evaluated on multi-objective drug design benchmarks, achieving high-quality Pareto fronts and beating baselines.

Result: MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality on multi-objective drug design benchmarks and consistently outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: The study presents a new paradigm for continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven exploration with experience-driven learning to enable robust global search in complex discrete optimization problems.

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

TL;DR: Introduces two strategies to convert real tabular data into complex-valued inputs and builds RVFL-X, a complex-valued RVFL that achieves superior performance over RVFL and SOTA RNNs on 80 UCI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of effective real-to-complex data representations and exploit the representational power of complex numbers in neural networks.

Method: Develops two generation methods: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven approach for complex-valued representation; integrates these into RVFL-X by using complex inputs, weights, and activations; produces real-valued outputs with the architecture.

Result: RVFL-X consistently outperforms the original RVFL and state-of-the-art RNN variants across 80 UCI datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that complex-valued representations within a simple RVFL framework can yield robust, efficient improvements on tabular tasks, motivating broader adoption of complex-valued neural nets in practice.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

*Anne Dranowski,Yura Kabkov,Daniel Tubbenhauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage framework combining machine learning for knot perception from images with traditional algorithms for knot invariants, aiming to reconstruct planar diagram codes and enable invariants-based classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust knot recognition from noisy visual data by marrying data-driven perception with rigorous topological invariants, bridging computer vision and knot theory.

Method: Use lightweight CNNs and transformers to predict crossing number from images; apply traditional algorithms to compute invariants like the Jones polynomial; pursue symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram codes (PD codes) as a follow-up to enable invariant computation.

Result: Demonstrates simple baselines that predict crossing number from images; shows that lightweight architectures recover meaningful structural information, supporting a two-stage perception-plus-invariants approach.

Conclusion: A two-stage pipeline leveraging ML for perception and invariants for classification is complementary and promising for robust knot recognition, with future work to integrate perception with symbolic reconstruction into PD codes for invariant-based classification.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

### [152] [Traj-Transformer: Diffusion Models with Transformer for GPS Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06291)
*Zhiyang Zhang,Ningcong Chen,Xin Zhang,Yanhua Li,Shen Su,Hui Lu,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based diffusion model for trajectory generation (Trajectory Transformer) yields higher-quality, more realistic GPS trajectories than CNN-based methods, by using a transformer backbone for noise prediction and conditional embedding, and evaluating two coordinate embeddings across scales on two real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based diffusion models (e.g., UNet) struggle with limited capacity to preserve fine-grained street-level details in trajectory generation, leading to deviations from realistic paths. A more expressive architecture is needed to capture long-range dependencies and preserve local details.

Method: Introduce Trajectory Transformer with a transformer backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. Compare two GPS coordinate embeddings—location embedding and longitude-latitude embedding—and analyze performance across scales. Validate on two real-world datasets.

Result: The Trajectory Transformer significantly improves generation quality and mitigates the deviation issues observed in prior CNN-based diffusion approaches, as demonstrated on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: A transformer-based approach with flexible coordinate embeddings enhances diffusion-based trajectory generation, offering better fidelity and scalability for realistic GPS trajectories.

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

### [153] [BlockGPT: Spatio-Temporal Modelling of Rainfall via Frame-Level Autoregression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06293)
*Cristian Meo,Varun Sarathchandran,Avijit Majhi,Shao Hung,Carlo Saccardi,Ruben Imhoff,Roberto Deidda,Remko Uijlenhoet,Justin Dauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlockGPT is a batched-tokenization autoregressive transformer for nowcasting that predicts full 2D frames per time step, using frame-local self-attention and cross-frame causal attention, achieving faster and more accurate precipitation maps than token-based or diffusion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nowcasting requires fast, accurate spatiotemporal predictions to mitigate extreme weather. Token-based autoregressive models suffer from inductive biases and slow inference; diffusion models are computationally intensive. A frame-centric, space-time factorization approach promises efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: BlockGPT adopts batched tokenization (Block) to predict full frames at each time step. It uses self-attention within each frame (spatial) and causal attention across frames (temporal). The model is instantiated for precipitation nowcasting and evaluated on KNMI (Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), against NowcastingGPT (token-based) and DiffCast+Phydnet (diffusion-based).

Result: BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy and event localization as measured by categorical metrics, with inference speeds up to 31x faster than comparable baselines.

Conclusion: BlockGPT demonstrates a scalable, efficient approach to nowcasting that outperforms token-based and diffusion methods, with potential applicability to broader video prediction tasks. Future work could explore robustness, longer horizons, and generalization to other spatiotemporal variables.

Abstract: Predicting precipitation maps is a highly complex spatiotemporal modeling
task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

*Shuang Cheng,Yihan Bian,Dawei Liu,Yuhua Jiang,Yihao Liu,Linfeng Zhang,Wenhai Wang,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDAR converts a trained autoregressive model into a blockwise diffusion model to enable parallel token decoding within blocks while preserving AR accuracy, enabling scalable speedups across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures and improving reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the trade-off between AR training efficiency and diffusion's parallel inference by unifying both into a practical paradigm that retains AR performance and enables high-throughput reasoning.

Method: Lightweight paradigm conversion from a pre-trained AR model to a blockwise diffusion model; during inference, generate across blocks autoregressively for coherence, while decoding tokens within each block in parallel using discrete diffusion; evaluate on dense and MoE models; apply test-time enhancements like majority voting and pass@k.

Result: AR models remain more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models; SDAR achieves low-cost AR-to-diffusion conversion with preserved AR-level performance; scaling shows robustness to block size and decoding thresholds; 30B MoE beats AR on GPQA and ChemBench; gains from test-time scaling.

Conclusion: SDAR is a practical paradigm that blends autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning, scalable to diverse architectures with speedups and no accuracy loss, with improved reasoning and domain adaptability.

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

### [155] [Flexible Swarm Learning May Outpace Foundation Models in Essential Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06349)
*Moein E. Samadi,Andreas Schuppert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized small-agent networks (SANs) with swarm-learning can outperform monolithic foundation models in dynamic, data-scarce environments, but at the cost of reduced reproducibility in detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the curse of dimensionality and the need for self-adaptive AI in dynamic, complex systems (e.g., ICU medicine) where fully mechanistic models are incomplete and data are scarce.

Method: Propose a decentralized SAN architecture where specialized subfunctions are handled by small interacting agents; leverage swarm-learning across diverse swarms; ground in mathematical results on SAN learning and existing applications.

Result: SANs can deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments compared to monolithic foundation models; however, they trade off reproducibility and detailed consistency.

Conclusion: For safety-critical, dynamic domains, SAN/swarm-learning offers a promising path beyond monolithic foundation models; broader applicability requires demonstrating clear superiority and managing reproducibility tradeoffs.

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

*Kürşat Tekbıyık,Güneş Karabulut Kurt,Antoine Lesage-Landry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIKAN is a physics-inspired network that embeds UAV A2G propagation physics as inductive biases, delivering interpretable, symbolic channel models with DL-like accuracy at a fraction of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate and interpretable A2G channel models that adapt to nonstationary environments; deterministic models lack flexibility, DL models lack explainability.

Method: Propose Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN) that integrates physical principles (free-space path loss, two-ray reflections) as flexible inductive biases, enabling a more flexible training process than PINNs.

Result: PIKAN achieves comparable accuracy to DL models on UAV A2G data, with only 232 parameters (up to 37x lighter than MLP baselines), while providing symbolic, physically-aligned expressions and remaining well correlated with measurements.

Conclusion: PIKAN offers efficient, interpretable, and scalable UAV channel modeling suitable for beyond-5G/6G, bridging the gap between physics-based and data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

### [157] [Lagrangian neural ODEs: Measuring the existence of a Lagrangian with Helmholtz metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06367)
*Luca Wolf,Tobias Buck,Bjoern Malte Schaefer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Helmholtz metrics quantify how close a given ODE is to an Euler-Lagrange form and, when combined with a second-order neural ODE, yield a Lagrangian neural ODE that learns Euler–Lagrange equations from positional data with no extra inference cost, enabling discrimination between Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian dynamics and improving results under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Not all neural ODE solutions are physically meaningful as Euler–Lagrange equations. A diagnostic, quantitative measure is needed to detect Lagrangian structure in dynamical data and to guide learning toward physically plausible dynamics.

Method: Introduce Helmholtz metrics to assess resemblance to Euler–Lagrange equations for a given ODE. Apply to noisy fundamental systems. Integrate with a second-order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE that directly learns Euler–Lagrange equations, using only positional data, with zero additional inference cost.

Result: Demonstrates in several fundamental systems with noise that the Helmholtz metrics can distinguish Lagrangian from non-Lagrangian dynamics using position data, and that the Lagrangian neural ODE improves neural ODE solutions without incurring extra inference cost.

Conclusion: Lagrangian neural ODEs provide a direct, cost-free path to learning Euler–Lagrange equations from data and to identifying physically plausible dynamics, enabling robust discrimination between Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems in the presence of noise.

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

*Rishabh Ranjan,Valter Hudovernik,Mark Znidar,Charilaos Kanatsoulis,Roshan Upendra,Mahmoud Mohammadi,Joe Meyer,Tom Palczewski,Carlos Guestrin,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relational Transformer (RT) pretrained on diverse relational databases enables strong zero-shot transfer to unseen relational tasks without task- or dataset-specific fine-tuning; a 22M-parameter model achieves ~94% of fully supervised AUROC in zero-shot, with fine-tuning yielding state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relational data exhibit highly heterogeneous schemas and structures, making cross-dataset/task transfer difficult. There is a need for an architecture that generalizes across relational domains without task- or dataset-specific fine-tuning or in-context examples.

Method: Introduce Relational Transformer (RT) that tokenizes cells with table/column metadata, is pretrained via masked token prediction, and uses a novel Relational Attention mechanism over columns, rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets and evaluated on zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

Result: In zero-shot, RT attains ~94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M-parameter model, outperforming a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample efficiency.

Conclusion: RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational data, showing that task-table context, relational attention patterns, and schema semantics enable effective zero-shot transfer and strong fine-tuned performance.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

### [159] [Monte Carlo Permutation Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06381)
*Tristan Cazenave*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCPS is a Monte Carlo Tree Search variant that enhances GRAVE by using permutation-based statistics from all playouts that include the path moves; it outperforms GRAVE in two-player games and matches it in multi-player games, with abstract move codes and a parameter-free weighting of statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When deep reinforcement learning is not feasible or compute is limited (e.g., General Game Playing), a robust, general MCTS method is needed that can exploit playout data without heavy hyperparameters.

Method: Introduce MCPS by modifying the exploration term to incorporate statistics from all playouts containing the root-to-node path moves; test across diverse games (board games, wargame, investment game, video game, multi-player games); use move abstractions; derive new weighting formulas for the three sources of statistics (without the GRAVE bias hyperparameter) and show insensitivity to the ref hyperparameter.

Result: MCPS yields better performance than GRAVE in all two-player games and equivalent results for multi-player games; move abstraction further improves AMAF and permutation statistics; provides a hyperparameter-free weighting of statistics.

Conclusion: MCPS offers a robust, hyperparameter-insensitive MCTS improvement suitable when deep RL is unavailable or pre-play compute is limited, with mathematical derivation and demonstrated benefits across diverse games.

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a perfectly truthful, multi-class calibration measure in batch setting, extending prior binary work; proves truthfulness of extensions and shows robustness to binning choices, addressing binned ECE issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrated predictions can be interpreted as probabilities; needs calibration measures that incentivize truth-telling. Prior measures were non-truthful; binary truthful measure introduced in 2025; this work extends to multi-class and analyzes truthfulness and robustness.

Method: Define a multi-class calibration measure, analyze extensions from binary to multi-class, prove truthfulness (perfectly truthful) in the batch setting, and empirically validate robustness to bin sizes/hyperparameters and preserve ordering between predictors.

Result: A perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class predictions in the batch setting; preserves the ordering of dominant vs dominated predictors regardless of binning; demonstrated robustness against bin size choices; addresses limitations of binned ECE.

Conclusion: This measure advances calibration evaluation by providing truthful, robust multi-class calibration assessment; informs practice on how to compare predictive models and extends the theoretical foundations of calibration measures.

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

### [161] [Geometry-Aware Backdoor Attacks: Leveraging Curvature in Hyperbolic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06397)
*Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hyperbolic (non-Euclidean) representations create boundary-driven asymmetries that backdoor triggers can exploit; defenses that push points inward degrade useful sensitivity, revealing a geometry-specific vulnerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As non-Euclidean foundation models become common, understanding security vulnerabilities unique to curved spaces is essential for robust deployment and defense.

Method: Formal analysis of boundary effects in hyperbolic spaces; design and evaluation of a geometry-adaptive trigger across tasks and architectures; comparison with conventional detectors and inward-pulling defenses.

Result: Triggers become more potent near the boundary; small input changes yield large representation shifts while detectors weaken; inward-pulling defenses suppress triggers but at the cost of reduced directional sensitivity; a geometry-adaptive trigger achieves higher attack success and mirrors theoretical trends across settings.

Conclusion: There is a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models; defenses have limited scope, and geometry-aware design is needed to understand and mitigate risks without sacrificing model utility.

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

### [162] [The Effect of Label Noise on the Information Content of Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06401)
*Ali Hussaini Umar,Franky Kevin Nando Tezoh,Jean Barbier,Santiago Acevedo,Alessandro Laio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes how label noise affects hidden representations in supervised classification by using Information Imbalance as a proxy for mutual information. It finds a double-descent pattern in representation information with model size, and shows underparameterized models benefit from noisy labels while overparameterized models are robust to noise. It also notes reduced information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers with higher cross-entropy loss, and that training on random labels leads to features far from random (beyond lazy learning).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how label noise impacts not just predictive accuracy but the internal representations learned by neural networks, addressing a gap in the literature on the relationship between label noise and representation quality and robustness.

Method: Systematically compare hidden representations using Information Imbalance (a computationally efficient proxy for conditional mutual information). Analyze representations across under- and overparameterized regimes, across noisy vs clean labels, and extend to networks trained on random labels. Examine layers such as the penultimate and pre-softmax and relate information imbalance to training loss (cross-entropy).

Result: Hidden representations exhibit double-descent in information content as a function of model parameter count, mirroring test error. In the underparameterized regime, noisy-label representations are more informative than clean-label ones; in the overparameterized regime, informativeness is similar between noisy and clean labels, indicating robustness to label noise in large models. Information imbalance between the penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases as cross-entropy loss increases in the overparameterized regime. When trained on random labels, networks perform worse than random features, suggesting that learning with random labels pushes weights beyond lazy learning to encode label information.

Conclusion: The study provides a new perspective on generalization by linking representation information to model size and label noise. Overparameterization yields robustness to label noise in representations, and training with random labels reveals the extent to which networks encode task-relevant information beyond lazy learning.

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Motivation: Challenging the assumption that bigger models yield better time-series performance, by seeking parameter- and compute-efficient pathways through portfolios of smaller, specialized models.

Method: Construct portfolios of pretrained specialist forecasting models. Evaluate ensembling and model-selection strategies over these portfolios. Investigate post-training a base model to generate diverse specialists. Compare against portfolios of generalists and baseline monolithic models on large-scale benchmarks, focusing on parameter count and compute (training + test-time).

Result: Specialist portfolios consistently outperform portfolios of generalists. Post-training a base model yields diverse specialists efficiently. Ensembling and model selection are more compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning, enabling competitive performance with substantially fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Portfolio-based, specialization-driven approaches offer a viable, compute-efficient alternative to ever-larger time-series models. Designing diverse specialists—via post-training—and combining them through ensembling or selection provides strong performance with reduced parameter counts and lower compute overhead compared to test-time fine-tuning.

Abstract: Is bigger always better for time series foundation models? With the question
in mind, we explore an alternative to training a single, large monolithic
model: building a portfolio of smaller, pretrained forecasting models. By
applying ensembling or model selection over these portfolios, we achieve
competitive performance on large-scale benchmarks using much fewer parameters.
We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently
trained generalists. Remarkably, we demonstrate that post-training a base model
is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

### [164] [Nearly Instance-Optimal Parameter Recovery from Many Trajectories via Hellinger Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06434)
*Eliot Shekhtman,Yichen Zhou,Ingvar Ziemann,Nikolai Matni,Stephen Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an Hellinger localization framework for multi-trajectory maximum-likelihood learning, yielding instance-optimal rates that scale with the full data budget across several models and outperform standard i.i.d./single-trajectory reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding sequential learning with multiple independent trajectories is central to modern ML (e.g., foundation models). Existing guarantees are limited to special cases; there is a need for instance-optimal bounds for broad models and losses in the multi-trajectory setting.

Method: Develop an approach that controls the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level by reducing to i.i.d., then perform localization as a quadratic form in parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information, yielding tight bounds.

Result: Instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under broad conditions; four case studies demonstrating the framework: mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression with non-Gaussian noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, linear-attention sequence models; bounds near asymptotic-optimal; improve over standard reductions.

Conclusion: The framework substantially broadens the reach of instance-optimal rates in multi-trajectory learning and provides a general, MLE-based toolkit for achieving near-optimal rates across diverse sequential models.

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

### [165] [Bayesian Optimization under Uncertainty for Training a Scale Parameter in Stochastic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06439)
*Akash Yadav,Ruda Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty uses a statistical surrogate to enable analytical expected-value computations and a closed-form optimizer for the acquisition function, yielding large computational savings versus Monte Carlo-based methods, demonstrated on two computational engineering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in systems with uncertainty is expensive due to noisy evaluations; there is a need for efficient optimization under uncertainty, especially for scale- or precision-type parameters.

Method: A Bayesian optimization framework with a statistical surrogate for the underlying random variable that allows analytical evaluation of the expectation; derives a closed-form optimizer for the random acquisition function to reduce per-iteration cost.

Result: The approach achieves up to 40x fewer data points and up to 40x lower computational cost per iteration compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo optimization, demonstrated on two numerical examples in computational engineering.

Conclusion: The proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost for hyperparameter tuning under uncertainty and is particularly effective for stochastic models with scale/precision-type parameters, as evidenced by two numerical examples.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

### [166] [Context-Aware Inference via Performance Forecasting in Decentralized Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06444)
*Joel Pfeffer,J. M. Diederik Kruijssen,Clément Gossart,Mélanie Chevance,Diego Campo Millan,Florian Stecker,Steven N. Longmore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proactive performance forecasting to weight ensemble predictions improves network inferences in decentralized learning, outperforming reactive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear pooling methods are reactive, updating weights based on historical performance which can be slow to adapt to regime changes; forecasting future performance enables context-aware weighting.

Method: Introduce a forecasting worker (inspired by Allora) that uses ML to predict per-epoch performance metrics (e.g., regret or regret z-score) of models in a time series; compare with forecasts of losses; assess the impact of feature choices and training horizon on weighting performance.

Result: Forecasts of regret and regret z-score yield greater improvement over naive historical averages and loss forecasts; however, predicting losses often underperforms; performance gains depend on feature sets and the number of training epochs, requiring domain-tailored choices.

Conclusion: Performance forecasting for prediction combination is a promising, broadly applicable approach to predictive weighting, potentially beneficial beyond decentralized networks, but requires careful domain-specific design and feature selection.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

### [167] [How NOT to benchmark your SITE metric: Beyond Static Leaderboards and Towards Realistic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06448)
*Prabhant Singh,Sibylle Hess,Joaquin Vanschoren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that current benchmarks for transferability estimation metrics are fundamentally flawed, inflating performance and letting simple, dataset-agnostic heuristics beat sophisticated methods; it calls for more robust, realistic benchmarks aligned with real-world model selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As transferability estimation metrics aim to select good pre-trained models without fine-tuning or accessing the source data, the validity of benchmarks evaluating these metrics is critical. The paper shows that widely used benchmarks use unrealistic model spaces and static performance hierarchies, misrepresenting progress in the field.

Method: The authors conduct empirical analyses of widely used benchmarks, exposing their shortcomings by examining the assumed model spaces and performance hierarchies, comparing transferability metrics against simple heuristics, and arguing for more realistic evaluation protocols; they offer concrete recommendations for better benchmark construction.

Result: Benchmarks for transferability estimation metrics are fundamentally flawed due to unrealistic model spaces and static hierarchies; these flaws artificially inflate metric performance, enabling simple heuristics to outperform sophisticated methods, revealing a disconnect between current evaluation protocols and real-world model selection.

Conclusion: To advance the field, the authors propose concrete guidelines for building robust and realistic benchmarks that better reflect practical model-selection scenarios and guide future research in transferability estimation.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

### [168] [Attention Sinks and Compression Valleys in LLMs are Two Sides of the Same Coin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06477)
*Enrique Queipo-de-Llano,Álvaro Arroyo,Federico Barbero,Xiaowen Dong,Michael Bronstein,Yann LeCun,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifies attention sinks and compression valleys via massive residual activations; provides theoretical entropy-reduction bounds and empirical validation across 410M–120B models; introduces a three-phase Mix-Compress-Refine information-flow framework for Transformer LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two seemingly related but isolated phenomena (attention sinks and compression valleys) by linking them to the dynamics of massive activations in the residual stream and information flow in depth.

Method: Theoretical proofs showing that massive activations induce representational compression with entropy-reduction bounds; large-scale experiments across multiple models; targeted ablations; analysis of beginning-of-sequence token activation norms and their emergence in middle layers.

Result: Massive activations cause both compression valleys and attention sinks to emerge simultaneously; BOS token extreme activations in middle layers drive the phenomena; ablations validate predictions; results motivate a depth-wise three-phase processing view.

Conclusion: Proposes Mix-Compress-Refine as a unified framework for information flow in Transformer LLMs, explaining when and why early layers broadly mix, middle layers compress, and late layers selectively refine, and linking this to task-dependent representations (embedding vs generation).

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

### [169] [Valid Stopping for LLM Generation via Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06478)
*Sanjeda Akter,Ibne Farabi Shihab,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An anytime-valid sequential testing framework for language-model generation that uses information lift and e-processes to stop early with delta-level guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve reliable, stopping-time guarantees and reduce computation while controlling risk in LM generation, addressing unknown centering, distribution drift, and the need to fuse multiple parameters; also to reduce verification burden via automated skeletons and a correctness gate.

Method: Compute the log-likelihood ratio between full models and weakened 'skeleton' baselines; apply self-normalized empirical-Bernstein e-processes for formal delta-level error control at arbitrary stopping times; perform online mean estimation for unknown centering, use mixture e-processes to combine parameters, and support adaptive resets under drift; introduce automated skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits); complement with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence boundaries + verifier) to preserve guarantees while delaying stopping.

Result: On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL reduces generation length by 22-28% compared with sequential baselines, with about 12% computational overhead to maintain delta-level control; 10.9% of stopped sequences remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it); the approach reduces verification burden by ~83% and is robust across skeleton families.

Conclusion: EDFL provides anytime-valid certificates of information sufficiency to stop generation, but it does not guarantee factual correctness and should be used as a first-stage filter to reduce verification workload in non-critical domains; not a standalone safety solution for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

### [170] [GUIDE: Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06502)
*Khoa Trinh,Gaurav Menghani,Erik Vee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guided Initialization and Distillation of Embeddings (Guide) is a distillation method that aligns the student with the teacher in parameter space, yielding substantial teacher-student gap reductions with large students, while adding no training/inference overhead and merging well with standard knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard distillation relies on matching outputs, which wastes teacher information and offers limited gains given the cost of training a large teacher. There is a need to exploit richer teacher information to improve smaller student models without extra overhead.

Method: Guide introduces guided initialization and embedding distillation to force the student to match the teacher in parameter space (not just outputs). It can be used alone or in combination with knowledge distillation, with an emphasis on leveraging embeddings to align parameters. It claims zero training/inference overhead.

Result: Using Guide with large student models (400M–1B params) trained on ~20B tokens reduces the teacher-student quality gap by about 25–26%. When combined with KD, gains are near additive; Guide alone outperforms KD alone.

Conclusion: Guide provides a cost-free (no overhead) pathway to improve student model quality by aligning with the teacher in parameter space, and is compatible with standard KD for further gains.

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

*I-Hsi Kao,Kanji Uchino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLO-ML automatically optimizes input time length and sampling rate for time-series prediction, improving accuracy versus fixed-length inputs; validated on air quality datasets (GAMS and proprietary data center data).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Input time length and sampling rate critically affect time-series model performance; fixed or manually tuned parameters may limit predictive accuracy and generalization. An adaptive, user-driven optimization of these temporal inputs can enhance ML outcomes across time-sensitive domains.

Method: ATLO-ML is an adaptive time-length optimization system that, given a user-defined target output time length, automatically selects the optimal input time length and sampling rate. It dynamically pre-processes time-series data by adjusting these parameters to maximize predictive performance, and is validated on air quality time-series datasets (GAMS-dataset and proprietary data center data).

Result: Using the optimized input time length and sampling rate yields significantly higher predictive accuracy than fixed-length inputs on the tested air quality datasets.

Conclusion: ATLO-ML provides a flexible, generalizable framework for temporal input parameter optimization in time-series ML workflows, with demonstrated gains and potential applicability across other time-sensitive domains.

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

*Momin Abbas,Ali Falahati,Hossein Goli,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Medix introduces a median-based framework to identify potential outliers from unlabeled data and trains a robust OOD detector using these identified outliers together with labeled InD data, backed by theoretical error bounds and empirical superiority in open-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection in real-world settings is compromised when unlabeled in-the-wild data contains mixed InD and OOD samples and there is no explicit OOD set.

Method: Identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation for robustness to noise; train an OOD classifier with these identified outliers plus labeled InD data; provide theoretical error bounds; validate empirically in open-world scenarios.

Result: Medix achieves superior performance over existing methods in open-world tests, with theoretical analysis supporting a low error rate and empirical results substantiating the claims.

Conclusion: A median-based approach to leveraging unlabeled data yields a robust OOD detector with theoretical guarantees, demonstrating practical effectiveness in real-world open-world applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

*Ali Naseh,Anshuman Suri,Yuefeng Peng,Harsh Chaudhari,Alina Oprea,Amir Houmansadr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Text-to-image leaderboards are vulnerable to rank manipulation via deanonymization of model outputs; CLIP-space classification can identify the source model from 150k images across 19 models; prompts play a key role; prompts enabling near-perfect deanonymization exist; stronger defenses are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leaderboards are used to compare generative AI models, but their integrity is compromised if outputs reveal model identity. This work extends threats from LLMs to text-to-image, showing deanonymization is tractable and harms fair evaluation.

Method: Assemble a dataset: 150,000 images from 280 prompts, 19 models from various organizations/sizes. Use real-time classification in CLIP embedding space to guess source model without prompt control or historical data. Propose a prompt-level separability metric to quantify how easily prompts reveal the generator.

Result: High-accuracy identification of the generating model using CLIP-space features; some prompts achieve near-perfect deanonymization;  evidence that rank manipulation is easier than previously thought.

Conclusion: Text-to-image leaderboards are more vulnerable to manipulation; defenses are needed, possibly including more robust attribution, prompt auditing, standardized evaluation protocols, and reduced leakage through outputs.

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

### [174] [Wide Neural Networks as a Baseline for the Computational No-Coincidence Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06527)
*John Dunbar,Scott Aaronson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In wide, randomly initialized networks, outputs become nearly independent iff the activation is nonlinear and has zero mean under a Gaussian input. This includes shifted ReLU/GeLU and tanh, but not the unshifted versions. The authors suggest zero-mean activations as a path to the Alignment Research Center's interpretability conjecture on no-coincidence in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when network outputs decouple in wide random architectures and connect this to interpretability concerns, proposing a criterion (zero-mean nonlinear activations) that yields independence.

Method: Analyze wide neural networks under random initialization with a natural hyperparameter choice. Derive that output independence holds exactly in the large-width limit when activations are nonlinear with zero Gaussian mean; provide concrete examples and clarify which activations satisfy the condition.

Result: A precise criterion for output independence: zero-mean nonlinear activations under Gaussian input ensure near independence of outputs in wide networks. Examples include ReLU/GeLU after an additive shift and tanh; pure ReLU or GeLU do not meet the zero-mean condition.

Conclusion: Zero-mean, nonlinear activation functions are a promising design choice for exploring the Alignment Research Center’s no-coincidence conjecture about AI interpretability, potentially limiting incidental coincidences in model behavior.

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

*Ameya Anjarlekar,Rasoul Etesami,R Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Approximating POMDPs with a finite-state Superstate MDP, then applying TD-learning and policy optimization to learn near-optimal policies; finite-time bounds show exponential decay of approximation error with history length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial observability makes belief-state learning intractable. The paper aims to provide a tractable finite-state surrogate (Superstate MDP) with theoretical guarantees and a practical learning algorithm.

Method: Transform the POMDP into a finite-history based MDP (Superstate MDP). Prove bounds linking the Superstate MDP’s optimal value to the original POMDP. Develop a policy-based learner with linear function approximation to optimize the Superstate MDP, using TD-learning followed by policy optimization.

Result: Finite-time bounds are derived showing the approximation error decreases exponentially with history length. They quantify the TD-learning error in a non-Markovian setting and demonstrate that a POMDP can be approximately solved via standard TD and policy optimization on the finite-history MDP.

Conclusion: A practical approach to solving POMDPs by reducing to a finite-history MDP; theoretical guarantees improve upon prior work; highlights a trade-off between history length and approximation accuracy and provides first explicit finite-time error bounds for TD in non-Markovian dynamics.

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

*Ke Guo,Haochen Liu,Xiaojun Wu,Chen Lv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecompGAIL decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components to reduce irrelevant interaction misguidance in multi-agent GAIL for traffic simulation, augmented with a social PPO objective and SMART backbone, achieving state-of-the-art on WOMD Sim Agents 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for traffic simulation suffers from covariate shift and instability in multi-agent settings. Existing GAIL methods can be misled by unrealistic neighbor interactions, causing poor realism. A structured decomposition of realism signals and social reward shaping could improve multi-agent traffic behavior modeling.

Method: Introduce Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL) that separates realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. Add a social PPO objective with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards. Integrate into a lightweight SMART-based backbone. Evaluate on WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark and compare to baselines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark with improved stability and realism over prior imitation learning baselines in multi-agent traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: Disentangling realism sources and applying social reward shaping mitigates interaction misguidance in multi-agent imitation learning, yielding more realistic traffic behavior. The approach shows promise for autonomous driving simulation and planning, though broader validation and ablation details would further establish generality and robustness.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

### [177] [Incoherence in goal-conditioned autoregressive models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06545)
*Jacek Karwowski,Raymond Douglas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Re-training offline-learned policies on their own actions (online fine-tuning) reduces incoherence in policies derived from naive goal-conditioning of autoregressive models and improves return, via three-way correspondences with control-as-inference, soft Q-learning, and posterior-to-reward folding (and temperature reduction in deterministic cases), revealing a training–inference trade-off and a link to the effective horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the structural incoherence that arises when autoregressive models are conditioned on goals to generate policies, by examining the effect of fine-tuning policies with online reinforcement learning using their own actions.

Method: Theoretically analyze the iterative re-training process, reframe it within control-as-inference and soft Q-learning, and establish three-way correspondences with alternative interpretations: folding the posterior into the reward, and, in deterministic scenarios, decreasing a temperature parameter. Discuss the computational content via the training–inference trade-off and use soft-conditioning of generative models to relate incoherence to the effective horizon.

Result: Proves that re-training on the policy’s own actions decreases incoherence and improves expected return; identifies a three-way correspondence among (i) control-as-inference, (ii) soft Q-learning, and (iii) iterative posterior–reward folding (and temperature reduction in deterministic cases); clarifies the computational mechanism via training–inference trade-offs; links incoherence to a reduced effective horizon through soft-conditioning.

Conclusion: Iterative offline-to-online re-training of policies on their own actions have a principled, interpretable effect: it mitigates incoherence, improves performance, and admits multiple coherent interpretations (inference, reward shaping, and temperature dynamics). This yields insights for designing offline-to-online RL and understanding horizon effects in generative policy models.

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

*Manshika Charvi Bissessur,Efimia Panagiotaki,Daniele De Martini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantics shape localisation robustness in a self-supervised, contrastive framework; post-hoc interpretability shows integrated gradients and attention weights reliably reflect learned behaviour, with frequent objects down-weighted, enabling explainable registration under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how semantic information influences localisation performance and robustness, and to evaluate interpretability signals in a learned, contrastive self-supervised localisation system.

Method: Train a localisation network on both original and perturbed maps; perform post-hoc introspection with multiple interpretability methods; conduct a reliability analysis; perform semantic class ablation to study weighting of objects.

Result: Integrated gradients and Attention Weights consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. Semantic ablation reveals that frequent objects are often down-weighted. The model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition, supporting explainable registration under visual and structural variations.

Conclusion: Semantics contribute to noise-robust and semantically salient representations for place definition, enabling explainable registration in challenging environments.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

### [179] [The Markovian Thinker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06557)
*Milad Aghajohari,Kamran Chitsaz,Amirhossein Kazemnejad,Sarath Chandar,Alessandro Sordoni,Aaron Courville,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Markovian Thinking introduces a fixed-size-state RL framework (Delethink) that chunks reasoning, yielding linear compute and longer reasoning with constant memory, outperforming LongCoT-RL in efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL thinking environments render the state unbounded (prompt plus all prior reasoning), causing quadratic compute as thoughts grow. A scalable solution requires decoupling thinking length from context.

Method: Propose Markovian Thinking and the Delethink RL environment, which structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. At chunk boundaries, the context is reset with a short carryover; the model writes a textual state near chunk end to enable seamless continuation. Train an 1.5B model (R1-Distill) to reason in 8K-token chunks but think across up to 24K tokens; evaluate with test-time scaling.

Result: LongCoT-RL with a 24K budget costs ~27 H100-months versus ~7 for Delethink, with an average thinking length of 96K; model achieves 24K thinking length while chunked at 8K. Delethink matches or surpasses LongCoT-RL on benchmarks and scales better with time.

Conclusion: Redesigning the thinking environment to a fixed-size, Markovian state yields linear compute for long reasoning, enabling very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and paving the way for efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the 1X World Model Challenge with two tracks (sampling and compression) and reports top performance by adapting Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B with AdaLN-Zero and LoRA for conditioning, and training a Spatio-Temporal Transformer for compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark real-world humanoid interaction world models and foster open benchmarks for forecasting future visual observations and predicting future discrete latent codes.

Method: Sampling track: adapt the video-generation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to produce video-state-conditioned future frames, conditioning on robot states via AdaLN-Zero and further post-training with LoRA. Compression track: train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch to predict future discrete latent codes.

Result: Sampling task achieved 23.0 dB PSNR; Compression task achieved Top-500 CE of 6.6386; both tracks secured 1st place.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a strong baseline for real-world humanoid world-model tasks, demonstrating effective conditioning and transformer-based architectures for both forecasting and latent-code compression within an open-source benchmark.

Abstract: World models are a powerful paradigm in AI and robotics, enabling agents to
reason about the future by predicting visual observations or compact latent
states. The 1X World Model Challenge introduces an open-source benchmark of
real-world humanoid interaction, with two complementary tracks: sampling,
focused on forecasting future image frames, and compression, focused on
predicting future discrete latent codes. For the sampling track, we adapt the
video generation foundation model Wan-2.2 TI2V-5B to video-state-conditioned
future frame prediction. We condition the video generation on robot states
using AdaLN-Zero, and further post-train the model using LoRA. For the
compression track, we train a Spatio-Temporal Transformer model from scratch.
Our models achieve 23.0 dB PSNR in the sampling task and a Top-500 CE of 6.6386
in the compression task, securing 1st place in both challenges.

*Yao Chen,David Ohlssen,Aimee Readie,Gregory Ligozio,Ruvie Martin,Thibaud Coroller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI as a supporting reader (AI-SR) provides reliable disease estimates and preserves trial conclusions in medical-image endpoints, outperforming AI-alone and human-only assessments, even with deliberately degraded models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate safety risks of deploying AI in clinical trials by ensuring endpoints used for conclusions remain robust, accurate, and generalizable.

Method: A comparative evaluation of two AI frameworks vs human-only assessment on two randomized trials with spinal X-ray endpoints; performance measured in cost, accuracy, robustness, generalization; stress-tested by injecting bad models (random/naive).

Result: AI-SR satisfied all criteria across model types, maintained treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and generalized to different populations even under severe model degradation.

Conclusion: AI-SR is the most suitable AI integration strategy for clinical trials involving image-based endpoints, balancing effectiveness, cost, and robustness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

### [182] [ELMUR: External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite for Long-Horizon RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07151)
*Egor Cherepanov,Alexey K. Kovalev,Aleksandr I. Panov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELMUR is a transformer architecture with structured layer-local external memory that uses bidirectional cross-attention and an LRU-based memory update to dramatically extend effective horizon under partial observability, achieving state-level performance on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Under partial observability and long horizons, crucial cues may appear far in the past. Standard recurrence/transformers struggle to retain long-term dependencies, and naive memory extensions scale poorly. A scalable, structured memory per layer can capture long-range information without exploding memory or computation.

Method: Introduce ELMUR: each transformer layer maintains its own memory embeddings. Memory interacts with the current query via bidirectional cross-attention. Memory is updated by an LRU-based module using replacement or convex blending. This layer-local external memory extends the effective horizon by up to ~100,000x beyond the attention window.

Result: ELMUR achieves 100% success on a synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it outperforms baselines on more than half of tasks. On MIKASA-Robo sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visuals, it nearly doubles baseline performance.

Conclusion: Structured, layer-local external memory offers a simple, scalable approach to decision making under partial observability by extending memory beyond standard attention windows without prohibitive cost.

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

### [183] [DPA-Net: A Dual-Path Attention Neural Network for Inferring Glycemic Control Metrics from Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06623)
*Canyu Lei,Benjamin Lobo,Jianxin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DPA-Net to estimate Ambulatory Glucose Profile metrics (TIR, TBR, TAR) from sparse SMBG data using a dual-path architecture (CGM-like reconstruction via spatial-channel attention; multi-scale ResNet for direct metric prediction), with an alignment mechanism and active point selector; demonstrated robust accuracy on a large real-world dataset, enabling AGP estimation where CGM is unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM provides rich data but is expensive and inaccessible in many regions; SMBG is cheaper but sparse; there is a need to derive AGP metrics from SMBG to broaden clinical utility and decision-making, especially in low- and middle-income regions.

Method: Dual-path architecture: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two paths is used to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. An active point selector identifies realistic and informative SMBG sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.

Result: Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias.

Conclusion: DPA-Net offers a practical and clinically relevant decision-support tool for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data in settings where CGM is not accessible, potentially expanding AGP-based glycemic assessment to resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

*Yong Liu,Di Fu,Yang Luo,Zirui Zhu,Minhao Cheng,Cho-Jui Hsieh,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POME is a zero-cost post-processing method that improves fine-tuned large language models by projecting the weight update (Delta W) via truncated SVD to equalize dominant directions and prune noise; yields consistent gains across tasks and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses improvement gaps in fine-tuned LMs without additional data or retraining by mitigating noise in the update direction; aims for a universally compatible, non-intrusive post-processing step that can be applied to any fine-tuning pipeline.

Method: Compute Delta W between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. Apply a muon-style projection using truncated SVD to equalize the influence of dominant update directions and prune small singular values (noise). This post-processing is decoupled from training, requires zero modifications, and imposes no overhead, making it compatible with any optimizer or distributed framework.

Result: Empirical gains of +2.5% on GSM8K and +1.0% on code generation. Demonstrated across 7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models. Code is available at the project repository.

Conclusion: POME provides a practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline, delivering consistent improvements across tasks and scales with broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An integrated AI and remote-sensing framework using sparse sensors and HydroNet, a graph-based model, achieves accurate leak detection and network-wide predictions in underground water pipelines, outperforming baselines on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground water and wastewater pipelines suffer leaks/infiltration causing water loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Manual inspections are inefficient and dense sensor networks are expensive. There's a need for scalable, accurate monitoring.

Method: Deploy a sparse set of remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data. Use HydroNet, a graph-based model that incorporates pipeline attributes (material, diameter, slope) in a directed graph. Employ edge-aware message passing combined with hydraulic simulations to enable accurate network-wide predictions from limited sensors.

Result: Evaluation on a real-world campus wastewater network dataset shows effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data collection and that HydroNet outperforms advanced baselines.

Conclusion: The integrated approach can be extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks and offers a scalable solution for leak detection and monitoring.

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

*Yasaman Torabi,Shahram Shirani,James P. Reilly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chem-NMF introduces a Boltzmann-energy-barrier-inspired bounding factor to stabilize convergence in multi-layer NMF with alpha-divergence, offering theoretical convergence guarantees and notable clustering gains on biomedical signals and face images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convergence analysis for multi-layer NMF with alpha-divergence is challenging; there is a need for theoretical guarantees and stable optimization. A physics-inspired framework using energy-barrier concepts provides a new avenue for analysis.

Method: Propose Chem-NMF algorithm with a bounding factor derived from Boltzmann probability of energy barriers; perform asymptotic convergence analysis starting from established results, and adapt it to real data. Empirically validate on biomedical signals and face images, reporting improvements.

Result: Clustering accuracy improved by 5.6% ± 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% ± 7.2% on face images (mean ± std).

Conclusion: First study to apply a physical chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze NMF convergence; bounding factor stabilizes optimization and yields practical gains; opens new directions for physics-informed NMF analysis.

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean
$\pm$ std).

*Shiye Su,Yuhui Zhang,Linqi Zhou,Rajesh Ranganath,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, scalable method improves flow matching for distribution-to-distribution tasks by injecting stochastic perturbations into source samples and flow interpolants, addressing sparse supervision when the source must be learned from data; it yields substantial gains (≈9 FID) across five imaging domains and lowers transport cost to better reflect the transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective modeling of transformations between two data distributions when the source distribution must be learned from limited data, overcoming limitations of standard flow matching that falter under sparse supervision in distribution-to-distribution settings.

Method: Introduce stochasticity by perturbing both source samples and the flow interpolants during training, yielding a simple and computationally efficient augmentation that strengthens supervision for the learned source distribution and the transport between distributions.

Result: Empirically superior: on five diverse imaging tasks (biology, radiology, astronomy) the method improves generation quality by an average of about 9 FID points compared with baselines and reduces the transport cost between input and generated samples.

Conclusion: Stochastic perturbations during training make flow matching more practical and reliable for distribution-to-distribution transformations, especially when the source is data-driven; this enhances generation quality and provides a more faithful representation of the learned transformation, though additional theoretical grounding could be explored.

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

*Yunpeng Gong,Sihan Lan,Can Yang,Kunpeng Xu,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StruSR is a structure-aware symbolic regression framework that uses PINN-derived local physics priors to guide genetic-programming-based expression discovery, yielding faster convergence, better structural fidelity, and more interpretable PDE-consistent formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression lacks explicit priors capturing global system behavior; there is a need to embed physics-informed structure into the search to produce interpretable, physically meaningful expressions.

Method: Train a physics-informed neural network (PINN) on time-series data to obtain local functional behavior. Use local Taylor expansions of the PINN to extract derivative-based structural information. Apply a masking-based attribution to quantify each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. Use these attributions to steer mutation/crossover in a genetic programming search. Employ a hybrid fitness that minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with governing equations and local analytical behavior.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark PDE systems shows StruSR achieves faster convergence, higher structural fidelity to the underlying physics, and improved interpretability compared with conventional symbolic regression baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating local physics priors derived from PINNs into structure-aware symbolic regression provides a principled framework for physics-grounded symbolic discovery, enabling more efficient and faithful recovery of governing equations in scientific modeling.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An amortized controller-guided ARDM framework for data assimilation in chaotic PDEs delivers fast, stable inference with a single forward rollout and on-the-fly corrections, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guidance for Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) during inference is underexplored, and applying ARDMs to data assimilation for chaotic spatiotemporal PDEs is computationally expensive and prone to forecast drift.

Method: Train a lightweight controller network offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls aimed at minimizing a terminal cost; at inference, reduce to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding adjoint computations or online optimization.

Result: Consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes.

Conclusion: The amortized controller framework provides fast, accurate DA inference with ARDMs and will release code and checkpoints.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

### [190] [The False Promise of Zero-Shot Super-Resolution in Machine-Learned Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06646)
*Mansi Sakarvadia,Kareem Hegazy,Amin Totounferoush,Kyle Chard,Yaoqing Yang,Ian Foster,Michael W. Mahoney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLOs fail at zero-shot multi-resolution inference due to aliasing; a simple, data-driven multi-resolution training protocol improves robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model continuous phenomena with discretized representations and achieve inference at arbitrary resolutions, testing whether MLOs can perform zero-shot super-resolution and how to overcome aliasing.

Method: Comprehensive empirical evaluation of zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution in MLOs, separating multi-resolution inference into frequency extrapolation and resolution interpolation, followed by proposing a lightweight multi-resolution training protocol to mitigate aliasing.

Result: MLOs are brittle for zero-shot and show aliasing; the proposed training protocol yields improved multi-resolution generalization and reduces aliasing.

Conclusion: Architectural malleability of MLOs alone is insufficient for robust zero-shot multi-resolution inference; targeted multi-resolution training is a practical remedy.

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

### [191] [Local Reinforcement Learning with Action-Conditioned Root Mean Squared Q-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06649)
*Frank Wu,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARQ is a local, forward-pass–based RL method that uses a goodness-function with action conditioning to estimate Q-values, achieving strong results on MinAtar and the DeepMind Control Suite and often outperforming backprop-trained baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap for Forward-Forward inspired learning in reinforcement learning. The work seeks a simple, biologically plausible, backprop-free value estimation method that works with temporal-difference learning across tasks where learning signals can be represented as layer-wise activity statistics.

Method: Introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), which apply a goodness function to layer activations, conditioned on actions, and trained via temporal-difference learning to estimate Q-values in a local, backprop-free manner.

Result: ARQ outperforms state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods on MinAtar and the DeepMind Control Suite, and also surpasses many backprop-trained algorithms on most tasks.

Conclusion: ARQ provides a simple, biologically grounded alternative for RL with strong empirical performance and code availability, suggesting that local forward-pass learning can be competitive in RL.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

### [192] [Rethinking Nonlinearity: Trainable Gaussian Mixture Modules for Modern Neural Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06660)
*Weiguo Lu,Gangnan Yuan,Hong-kun Zhang,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMNM is a differentiable module inspired by Gaussian mixtures that enhances non-linearity via flexible Gaussian projections, applicable across MLPs, CNNs, attention, and LSTMs, with reported performance gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional fixed activation functions by introducing a more expressive, differentiable nonlinear module based on Gaussian mixture models and Gaussian kernel geometry.

Method: Design GMNM modules that relax probabilistic constraints, employ flexible Gaussian projections, and integrate seamlessly into various neural architectures for end-to-end gradient training.

Result: Experimental results indicate consistent performance improvements over standard baselines across MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs.

Conclusion: GMNM offers a powerful, flexible nonlinear module that can enhance efficiency and accuracy across a wide range of neural network applications.

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

### [193] [The Effect of Attention Head Count on Transformer Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06662)
*Penghao Yu,Haotian Jiang,Zeyu Bao,Ruoxi Yu,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers' expressive power hinges on the number of attention heads. With many heads, epsilon-approximation can be achieved efficiently; with too few heads, parameter growth is at least exponential in 1/epsilon (and T). In the single-head setting, memorization is possible with embedding dimension O(T), and the feed-forward block suffices for approximation. The work provides both new theory (bounds) and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Transformer structural parameters, especially the number of attention heads, affect expressive power and approximation capabilities, and to establish rigorous bounds in a nonlinear, practically relevant setting.

Method: Introduce a generalized D-retrieval task dense in the space of continuous functions; derive upper and lower bounds on parameter complexity required for epsilon-approximation; analyze multi-head vs single-head regimes; show memorization possible with embedding dimension O(T) in the single-head case; validate findings with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: (1) Multi-head Transformers admit efficient epsilon-approximation when heads are sufficiently many; (2) If heads are too few, parameter count must scale at least as O(1/epsilon^{cT}) for some c and sequence length T; (3) First rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear, practically relevant setting; (4) In the single-head case, an embedding dimension of O(T) enables complete memorization of the input, with approximation realized by the feed-forward block; (5) Empirical validation on synthetic and real tasks corroborates the theory.

Conclusion: The number of attention heads fundamentally constrains Transformer expressiveness and parameter efficiency. The work delineates clear regimes where efficient approximation is possible and where parameters must blow up, provides the first nonlinear lower bound of this nature, and demonstrates memorization capabilities in the single-head regime, all supported by experiments.

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

*Udbhav Bamba,Minghao Fang,Yifan Yu,Haizhong Zheng,Fan Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XRPO improves policy optimization for LLMs by adaptive rollout exploration, in-context seeding, and novelty-aware exploitation, achieving better performance and faster convergence than GRPO/GSPO on math/coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited exploration and poor feedback utilization in rollout-based RL for LLM reasoning, especially on challenging prompts and zero/sparse rewards.

Method: 1) Adaptive rollout allocator prioritizes prompts with high potential for uncertainty reduction. 2) In-context seeding injects curated exemplars to guide difficult reasoning trajectories. 3) Group-relative, novelty-aware advantage sharpening uses sequence likelihoods to amplify low-probability but correct responses, enhancing exploitation.

Result: XRPO outperforms GRPO and GSPO by up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, and accelerates training convergence by up to 2.7x across diverse math and coding benchmarks on reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: XRPO provides a unified, principled framework that balances exploration and exploitation in policy optimization for LLM reasoning, delivering notable performance gains and faster training across tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

### [195] [TimeFormer: Transformer with Attention Modulation Empowered by Temporal Characteristics for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06680)
*Zhipeng Liu,Peibo Duan,Xuan Tang,Baixin Li,Yongsheng Huang,Mingyang Geng,Changsheng Zhang,Bin Zhang,Binwu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeFormer introduces MoSA-enhanced self-attention for time series with multi-scale analysis, achieving strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in NLP but struggle with time series due to modality differences. Time series have unidirectional past-to-future influence and decaying influence over time; authors integrate these temporal priors via Hawkes process constraints and causal masking.

Method: A Transformer variant (TimeFormer) with MoSA (two modulation terms) in self-attention to encode temporal priors, coupled with a multi-scale/subsequence analysis framework to capture dependencies at different temporal scales.

Result: TimeFormer achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art on real-world datasets, with up to 7.45% reduction in MSE over the best baseline and benchmarks set on 94.04% of metrics; MoSA is shown to be broadly applicable to other Transformer models.

Conclusion: MoSA and the TimeFormer architecture effectively tailor Transformers for time-series data, and the MoSA mechanism can generalize to improve other Transformer-based models.

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

### [196] [Distributed Algorithms for Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits with Collision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06683)
*Daoyuan Zhou,Xuchuang Wang,Lin Yang,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distributed stochastic MMAB with collision feedback achieves near-optimal group/individual regret using an adaptive communication protocol with O(log log T) communication; extends to periodic asynchronous setting with a lower bound and logarithmic regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In fully distributed settings without central coordination, collisions yield no rewards and communication is costly; aim to minimize both regret and communication.

Method: Proposes an adaptive, efficient communication protocol within a distributed MMAB algorithm; analyzes group and individual regret; demonstrates O(log log T) communication; validates with experiments; extends framework to periodic asynchronous setting and proves a lower bound, with an algorithm achieving logarithmic regret.

Result: Achieves near-optimal group and individual regret; communication cost scales as O(log log T); experiments show significant improvements over baselines and reduced individual regret compared to SOTA; in periodic asynchronous setting, establishes lower bound and presents a logarithmic-regret algorithm.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that distributed MMAB with collision feedback can attain strong regret guarantees with minimal communication; provides both a practical algorithm and theoretical bounds for synchronous and asynchronous settings.

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

### [197] [AutoBalance: An Automatic Balancing Framework for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06684)
*Kang An,Chenhao Si,Ming Yan,Shiqian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoBalance introduces a post-combine training paradigm for PINNs, assigning an independent adaptive optimizer to each loss term and aggregating their preconditioned updates, improving training stability and accuracy over pre-combine methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs face spectrally heterogeneous losses (PDE residuals, boundary conditions) whose conflicting objectives hinder joint optimization. Pre-combine gradient methods disrupt optimizer preconditioning, limiting performance.

Method: Use separate adaptive optimizers for each loss component; compute preconditioned updates for each term; aggregate updates to update the network parameters (post-combine). Compatible with existing PINN strategies.

Result: On challenging PDE benchmarks, AutoBalance achieves significant reductions in solution error (MSE and L∞) compared with existing frameworks; the approach is orthogonal and complementary to other PINN methods, boosting their effectiveness.

Conclusion: Post-combine adaptive optimization provides a principled way to handle heterogeneous loss landscapes in PINNs, improving stability and accuracy without sacrificing compatibility with other techniques.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

### [198] [Is the Hard-Label Cryptanalytic Model Extraction Really Polynomial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06692)
*Akira Ito,Takayuki Miura,Yosuke Todo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossLayer Extraction proposes a scalable model-extraction attack for deep ReLU networks under hard-label access by leveraging inter-layer neuron interactions to infer information from deeper layers, reducing query complexity compared to prior direct-per-neuron extraction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box model-extraction attacks under hard-label (only final class) access face exponential query costs as attack depth grows, making them impractical for deeper networks. Since DNNs are valuable IP, there is a need for more scalable, realistic extraction techniques.

Method: The authors introduce CrossLayer Extraction, which does not directly reconstruct each neuron’s weights and biases. Instead, it exploits interactions between neurons across layers to infer information about deeper-layer parameters, thereby bypassing the exponential cost of per-neuron extraction and reducing overall query complexity.

Result: CrossLayer Extraction significantly lowers the query burden relative to direct neuron-by-neuron recovery and mitigates the exponential limitations of prior approaches, enabling more practical extraction from deeper layers under hard-label access.

Conclusion: CrossLayer Extraction offers a new, more scalable dimension to model-extraction attacks by leveraging cross-layer neuron dynamics. This advances the attack landscape under restricted access and invites further study into defenses and refinements for deeper networks.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

### [199] [A Diffusion Model for Regular Time Series Generation from Irregular Data with Completion and Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06699)
*Gal Fadlon,Idan Arbiv,Nimrod Berman,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-step framework combines Time Series Transformer completion for irregular sequences with a vision-based diffusion model using masking, achieving strong, efficient generation of realistic irregular time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Irregular sampling and missing values in time series hinder realistic generation; existing methods are suboptimal and costly; diffusion-based approaches like ImagenTime struggle with irregular sequences.

Method: 1) Time Series Transformer imputes irregular sequences to create natural neighborhoods. 2) Vision-based diffusion model with masking reduces reliance on completed values, leveraging both completion and masking for robustness.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 70% improvement in discriminative score and 85% reduction in computational cost.

Conclusion: The two-step approach effectively merges completion and masking to enable robust, efficient generation of realistic irregular time series; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

### [200] [Dual Goal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06714)
*Seohong Park,Deepinder Mann,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces dual goal representations for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, encoding a state's relation to all others via temporal distances; theory shows invariance to state encoding and sufficiency to recover an optimal policy while filtering noise; empirically improves offline goal-reaching across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fix limitations in GCRL representations by using a dynamics-based, environment-intrinsic state encoding that is invariant to the original state representation and robust to exogenous noise.

Method: Define a dual goal representation as the vector of temporal distances from a given state to all other states. Prove its invariance to the chosen state representation and its sufficiency to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy, while enabling denoising of exogenous noise. Develop a practical learning method that can be combined with any existing GCRL algorithm and evaluate it on the OGBench suite.

Result: Empirically, dual goal representations consistently improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based tasks in the OGBench suite.

Conclusion: Dual goal representations provide a principled, dynamics-based, environment-invariant state encoding with theoretical guarantees and practical plug-in gains for GCRL, enabling improved robustness and performance when integrated with existing algorithms.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

*Zachris Björkman,Jorge Loría,Sophie Wharrie,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Bayesian experimental design (BED) guided elicitation for heterogeneous causal discovery and a variational mixture structure learning (VaMSL) that extends DiBS to infer mixtures of causal Bayesian networks (CBNs); uses expert-informed priors and demonstrates improved learning on synthetic heterogeneous data and a breast cancer dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In heterogeneous domains a single causal graph is insufficient and prior knowledge from domain experts is valuable but existing elicitation methods assume a single graph. The work proposes a principled approach to elicitate and incorporate multiple causal models via mixtures of CBNs to capture heterogeneity.

Method: Extend differentiable Bayesian structure learning (DiBS) to VaMSL to iteratively infer mixtures of CBNs. Construct informative graph priors from elicited expert feedback, guided by BED principles to select informative experiments and data. Evaluate on heterogeneous synthetic data with simulated expert feedback and apply to a breast cancer database.

Result: VaMSL produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture components/clusters) and shows improved structure learning on heterogeneous synthetic data when guided by expert input. Demonstrates capability to capture complex distributions in a breast cancer dataset.

Conclusion: Mixture-based causal discovery with expert-informed priors under BED is feasible and beneficial for heterogeneous domains, enabling discovery of multiple plausible causal models and improved structure learning across diverse data sources.

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

TL;DR: Extends Forward-Forward learning to function regression and evaluates its feasibility on univariate and multivariate functions, with preliminary exploration of extensions to Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the current limitation of the Forward-Forward paradigm being restricted to classification by enabling accurate function regression, thereby broadening non-backpropagation-based training to regression tasks and neuromorphic/physical neural architectures.

Method: Introduce a Forward-Forward regression framework, define regression-oriented objectives within the forward-forward paradigm, train without backpropagation, and evaluate on univariate/multivariate functions. Include preliminary studies on integrating the approach with Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Result: Demonstrates that Forward-Forward with regression objectives can approximate functions on both univariate and multivariate tasks and provides initial evidence supporting feasibility of extending the paradigm to Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Conclusion: Forward-Forward regression is viable and broadens the scope of non-backpropagation training to function approximation; further work is needed to optimize performance and to fully mature the proposed extensions to KANs and DPNNs.

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

Method: Apply Physics-Informed Neural Networks to the inverse SIR problem using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI); perform a spatio-temporal analysis across all German federal states over three years; estimate state-specific transmission and recovery rates and the time-varying reproduction number Rt.

Result: The study finds strong regional variation in transmission dynamics, with Rt and other parameters correlating with vaccination uptake and shifting with major pandemic phases; demonstrates the utility of PINNs for localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

Conclusion: PINNs offer a promising framework for extracting region-specific epidemiological parameters from noisy data, enabling detailed, long-range analysis of disease dynamics and policy impacts in a spatially resolved setting.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

### [204] [Get RICH or Die Scaling: Profitably Trading Inference Compute for Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06790)
*Tavish McDonald,Bo Lei,Stanislav Fort,Bhavya Kailkhura,Brian Bartoldson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-time compute improves robustness to adversarially OOD inputs via compositional generalization, but benefits depend on base model robustness and defense alignment; gains persist under some gradient- and multimodal-attack conditions when defensive specifications are emphasized, suggesting a layered defense strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models remain vulnerable to adversarially out-of-distribution data despite large robustification efforts. Prior work shows test-time reasoning can improve adherence to defensive specs, but this benefit falters if attackers access gradients or multimodal inputs. The goal is to understand when and why inference-time compute helps under stronger attack scenarios.

Method: Propose the Robustness from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH). Conduct empirical evaluations across vision-language models and attack types to test whether inference-time compute yields robustness gains when prompted defenses emphasize defensive specifications and when attacked data can be decomposed into in-distribution components. Compare robustified and non-robustified models, and assess the role of RL fine-tuning and prolonged reasoning.

Result: Robustness gains from test-time compute emerge when compositionally generalizable to the attacked data's ID components is unlocked by prompting that emphasizes defensive specifications. These gains persist even with gradient-based and multimodal attacks on robust models, but not on non-robust models, illustrating a rich-get-richer dynamic (RICH) where attacked data becomes more ID for robust models. RL fine-tuning and prolonged reasoning are not essential. The synergy between train-time and test-time defenses is recommended.

Conclusion: Layering defensive strategies at training and testing stages yields synergistic robustness. Compositional generalization makes OOD inputs interpretable via ID components, enabling inference compute to help defend against adversarial OOD data. The benefit scales with base model robustness, supporting a defense-in-depth approach.

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

*Giovanni Donghi,Daniele Zambon,Luca Pasa,Cesare Alippi,Nicolò Navarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple OCGL approach freezes a randomly initialized encoder to produce stable node embeddings and trains only a lightweight classifier, achieving strong performance without replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in online continual graph learning (OCGL) arises from drifting representations; aim to obtain stable, expressive embeddings with minimal architecture changes.

Method: Use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to aggregate neighborhood information and generate node embeddings; freeze the encoder and train only a lightweight classifier online; no memory buffer or replay.

Result: Across several OCGL benchmarks, the method yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with improvements up to 30%, often approaching the joint offline training upper bound.

Conclusion: Architectural simplicity and stability can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in OCGL without replay mechanisms, as a fixed encoder provides robust, expressive embeddings while avoiding representation drift.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

*Linus Kreitner,Paul Hager,Jonathan Mengedoht,Georgios Kaissis,Daniel Rueckert,Martin J. Menten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitTokens introduce a single-token numeric encoding using IEEE 754 floating-point representation, enabling even small language models to learn basic arithmetic efficiently, potentially expanding the length and complexity of solvable problems without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with large numerical data and long calculations, often relying on external tools or long reasoning chains that hinder efficiency. Numbers are frequently split into multiple tokens, hindering precision and throughput. There is a need for a compact, single-token, precise numeric encoding that preserves arithmetic semantics.

Method: Present BitTokens, a tokenization strategy that maps each numeric value to a single token via its IEEE 754 binary floating-point representation. Define the encoding, integrate into the tokenizer, and conduct extensive experiments to assess whether LLMs can learn and perform arithmetic operations more efficiently using BitTokens.

Result: Experiments show that BitTokens enable even small language models to learn and implement basic arithmetic algorithms nearly perfectly, reducing tokenization-induced bottlenecks and enabling longer, more complex problems to be solved without external tools.

Conclusion: BitTokens meet the proposed desiderata for single-token numeric encodings and can substantially expand the numerical reasoning capabilities and problem-length tolerance of LLMs, suggesting a practical path toward more self-contained arithmetic reasoning in language models.

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

### [207] [Recurrence-Complete Frame-based Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06828)
*Michael Keiblinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recurrence-complete architectures can outperform fully parallelizable, non-recurrent models for long-horizon, agentic tasks; the paper demonstrates training a recurrence-based model on GitHub action sequences, showing power-law loss scaling with sequence length and wall-clock amortization, implying recurrence helps overcome limitations of attention-only designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing proofs suggest architectures that are fully parallelizable across forward or backward passes cannot capture problem classes crucial for long-running agentic tasks. The work argues for recurrence (i.e., limited recurrence depth) to enable accumulation of information over long horizons, with implications for practical agentic systems such as software agents.

Method: Introduce a recurrence-complete architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. The training loss scales as a power law with the trained sequence length while keeping parameter count fixed. They also analyze how longer-sequence training amortizes wall-time costs, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Result: Empirical finding that loss follows a power-law with respect to trained sequence length under a fixed parameter budget, and that extending sequence length during training reduces loss when measured against wall time due to amortized costs.

Conclusion: Recurrence-complete architectures address limitations of attention-only designs for long-horizon, agentic tasks. Training with longer sequences improves performance even under fixed model size, with wall-clock efficiency improving over time, suggesting practical benefits for building long-horizon agents (e.g., software engineering agents).

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

### [208] [Early wind turbine alarm prediction based on machine learning: AlarmForecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06831)
*Syed Shazaib Shah,Daoliang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework for wind turbines that predicts alarms in advance using a two-step LSTM-based approach: first forecasting time-series alarms, then classifying the forecasted alarms; tested on 14 turbines over 5 years with 10/20/30-minute horizons achieving 82%, 52%, and 41% accuracy respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift from alarm diagnosis to proactive alarm prevention in wind turbines, reducing alarm frequency and enabling proactive interventions to avert failures.

Method: A two-module approach: (1) an LSTM-based regression module to forecast future alarm events over time-series data, and (2) a classification module that tags (or labels) the forecasted alarms across the complete alarm taxonomy, enabling forecast of the entire alarm set rather than individual alarms.

Result: On 14 Senvion MM82 turbines across a 5-year period, the AFC framework achieved forecast accuracies of 82% (10 min), 52% (20 min), and 41% (30 min). These results suggest the model can anticipate alarms sufficiently to enable preventive action and reduce alarm frequency.

Conclusion: The AFC approach demonstrates potential for proactive maintenance in wind turbines by forecasting and classifying alarms, enabling earlier interventions to prevent faults and improve operational efficiency; generalizability and real-world deployment would benefit from further validation across more turbine types and longer horizons.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive
intervention.

*Vasileios Titopoulos,Kosmas Alexandridis,Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vectorized FlashAttention on RISC-V vector processors with tiling and low-cost FP exponential approximations deliver substantial speedups for attention kernels without extra ISA extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms are central to many ML models and require efficient, scalable attention kernels. This work targets accelerating attention on vector processors based on RISC-V by minimizing scalar code, reducing the cost of exponentials in softmax, and avoiding new instructions while improving memory locality.

Method: Vectorize FlashAttention on RISC-V vector architectures, implement a low-cost exponential approximation in floating-point arithmetic, apply tiling strategies to improve memory locality, and avoid extending the ISA with custom instructions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance gains and good scalability for attention layers in practical applications with the vectorized approach.

Conclusion: A feasible approach to accelerating attention on RISC-V vector hardware: tiling and FP exponential approximation enable efficient, scalable attention without ISA extensions, benefiting real-world workloads.

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-TFT model for multivariate time series forecasting that fuses convolutional feature extraction with a Temporal Fusion Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance (MAPE up to 2.2%) and SHAP-based explainability; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine CNNs' strength in local-pattern extraction with TFT's strength in modeling long-range dependencies for accurate multivariate time-series forecasting, demonstrated on hydroelectric flow data.

Method: A CNN module with 1D convolutional layers distills local patterns and reduces noise/dimensionality, feeding feature maps into a Temporal Fusion Transformer backbone that uses multi-head attention to capture short- and long-term dependencies and adaptively weigh covariates; explainability via SHAP-MHAW (Shapley additive explanations with multi-head attention weights); evaluated on hydroelectric natural flow time series; code available at GitHub.

Result: CNN-TFT outperforms established deep learning models with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) up to 2.2% on the hydroelectric dataset; SHAP-MHAW provides model explanations; architecture named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW with code at GitHub.

Conclusion: The proposed CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW architecture is a promising approach for high-fidelity, multivariate time series forecasting; the method is generalizable and the accompanying explainability framework enhances interpretability; potential for broader applications and future analyses.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

### [211] [Enhancing Bankruptcy Prediction of Banks through Advanced Machine Learning Techniques: An Innovative Approach and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06852)
*Zuherman Rustam,Sri Hartini,Sardar M. N. Islam,Fevi Novkaniza,Fiftitah R. Aszhari,Muhammad Rifqi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper abstracts propose using machine learning classifiers (LR, RF, SVM) to predict bank bankruptcy. Random Forest (RF) yields about 90% accuracy for Turkish commercial banks, while ML methods also effectively predict bankruptcy among Indonesian rural banks, indicating ML’s superiority over traditional stats-based models and its policy relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial stability depends on the solvency of the banking system. Traditional statistical bankruptcy models (e.g., Altman’s Z-score) rely on rigid assumptions and may miss nonlinear or complex patterns. ML approaches promise higher predictive accuracy and broader applicability across different banking sectors and countries.

Method: Two datasets: Turkish banks (44 active, 21 bankrupt; 1994–2004) and Indonesian rural banks (43 active, 43 bankrupt; 2013–2019), with five rural banks used as a demonstrative case. Evaluated ML algorithms include logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM); reported accuracy as performance metric.

Result: RF achieved about 90% accuracy in forecasting bankruptcy for Turkish commercial banks. All three ML methods accurately predicted the likelihood of bankruptcy in Indonesian rural banks, suggesting robust predictive performance across contexts.

Conclusion: ML-based bankruptcy models can aid in policy design and risk management by providing accurate early warnings of bank distress, potentially reducing bankruptcy costs and enhancing financial stability.

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

TL;DR: Hybrid Heterogeneous MPNN (HH-MPNN) for ACOPF dramatically speeds up computation while maintaining near-optimality and generalizes to unseen topologies, scaling from 14 to 2000 buses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AC Optimal Power Flow is computationally expensive for large grids; standard ML methods struggle with scalability and adapting to topology changes without retraining.

Method: Introduce HH-MPNN with distinct node/edge types (buses, generators, loads, shunts, lines, transformers) and a scalable transformer component to capture long-range dependencies; train on default topologies and evaluate on grids 14–2000 buses; test zero-shot generalization to thousands of unseen topologies; pre-train on smaller grids to boost performance.

Result: Achieves <1% optimality gap on default topologies up to 2000 buses; zero-shot to thousands of unseen topologies yields <3% gap despite training only on defaults; pre-training on smaller grids improves performance on larger grids; speedups of 1,000x–10,000x over interior-point solvers.

Conclusion: HH-MPNN offers a scalable, topology-adaptive ML approach for ACOPF, enabling real-time power system operations with strong generalization and significant computational speedups.

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework SaFeR-VLM embeds safety into multimodal reasoning, achieving strong safety and helpfulness with a smaller model by integrating QI-Safe-10K, safety-aware rollout, structured reward modeling, and GRPO optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 'Reasoning Tax' phenomenon in Multimodal Large Reasoning Models where adversarial or unsafe prompts influence the reasoning process; existing defenses act at the output stage, leaving the reasoning process exposed. The goal is to constrain and align the entire reasoning trajectory with safety.

Method: SaFeR-VLM introduces four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K dataset focusing on safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout where unsafe generations are reflected upon and corrected rather than discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; (IV) GRPO optimization that reinforces safe and corrected trajectories, enabling safety to be an active driver of reasoning.

Result: On six benchmarks, SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average safety and helpfulness scores of 70.13 and 78.97, outperforming both same-scale and >10× larger models (e.g., Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, GLM4.5V-106B). SaFeR-VLM-7B, benefiting from scale, surpasses GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash on safety by 6.47 and 16.76 points respectively, without hurting helpfulness. Code is available at the authors' repository.

Conclusion: Safety is effectively embedded as an active driver of multimodal reasoning, enabling scalable, generalizable safety-aware reasoning that is robust against explicit and implicit risks and supports dynamic, interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Motivation: Integrating multi-omics single-cell data is hampered by high dimensionality and complex cross-modality relationships; there is a need for adaptive, scalable, and interpretable models that can reveal biologically meaningful inter-omics connections.

Method: A heterogeneous graph autoencoder (MoRE-GNN) that combines graph convolution and attention to dynamically construct relational graphs from data, operating on multi-omics modalities within a unified framework to improve inter-modality integration and downstream predictions.

Result: Evaluations on six public datasets show MoRE-GNN outperforms existing methods, especially when inter-modality correlations are strong, and learns representations that enable accurate downstream cross-modal predictions while capturing biologically meaningful relationships.

Conclusion: MoRE-GNN provides an adaptive, scalable, and interpretable framework for multi-omics integration, though performance may vary with dataset complexity.

Abstract: The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to

Furthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream
cross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,
MoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing
multi-omics integration.

### [215] [Angular Constraint Embedding via SpherePair Loss for Constrained Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06907)
*Shaojie Zhang,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpherePair introduces an angular-constraint embedding for deep constrained clustering (DCC). It decouples representation learning from clustering, handles unknown cluster counts with fast inference, and provides theoretical guarantees, outperforming state-of-the-art DCC methods with scalable, real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DCC approaches are hampered by anchors in end-to-end models or poor discriminative power in Euclidean embeddings, limiting scalability and real-world applicability. A method that better encodes pairwise constraints, with scalable clustering and the ability to infer cluster counts on unseen data, is needed.

Method: Propose SpherePair: an angular constraint embedding using SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation. It encodes pairwise must-link/cannot-link constraints in angular space, yielding clustering-friendly representations. The method separates representation learning from clustering, preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to pre-specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of cluster count, and is supported by theoretical guarantees.

Result: Compared against state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, SpherePair achieves superior performance and scalability. Empirical validation supports the theoretical insights, confirming real-world effectiveness. Code is released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: SpherePair provides an angular-space embedding for DCC that overcomes limitations of prior anchor-based and Euclidean approaches, enabling scalable, generalizable constrained clustering with unknown cluster counts and fast cluster-number inference, backed by theory and empirical evidence.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

### [216] [Vacuum Spiker: A Spiking Neural Network-Based Model for Efficient Anomaly Detection in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06910)
*Iago Xabier Vázquez,Javier Sedano,Muhammad Afzal,Ángel Miguel García-Vico*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Vacuum Spiker, an energy-efficient Spiking Neural Network for time-series anomaly detection using a global-activity criterion, novel STDP-based training, and a 1-spike-per-step encoding; shows competitive accuracy with significant energy savings on public datasets and a solar inverter case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for anomaly detection in time series across industries; deep models are accurate but energy-intensive, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices (IoT, edge, wearables).

Method: A Spiking Neural Network (Vacuum Spiker) with a detection criterion based on global changes in neural activity rather than reconstruction/prediction error; trained via Spike Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way to induce activity changes when anomalies occur; a new input encoding discretizes the input into non-overlapping intervals, mapping each interval to a single neuron, yielding one spike per time step and improving energy efficiency.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to broad deep learning and machine learning baselines while significantly reducing energy consumption; validated on public anomaly detection datasets and in a real-world solar inverter case study showing effective identification of power curtailment events.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of energy-efficient anomaly detection on resource-constrained devices using SNNs with a global-activity criterion, a novel STDP-based training method, and a single-spike encoding, highlighting potential for sustainable deployment in IoT/edge environments.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

TL;DR: LLMs can autonomously generate effective and interpretable ML pipelines with high SHAP fidelity and sparsity, closely matching manually engineered baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether contemporary LLMs can design end-to-end ML pipelines that are both predictive and interpretable, reducing manual engineering effort.

Method: Prompt three LLMs (GPT, Claude, DeepSeek) to create pipelines for four classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, LSTM) on two datasets (binary driver alertness and multilabel yeast); evaluate predictive performance (recall, precision, F1) and SHAP-based explainability via Average SHAP Fidelity and Average SHAP Sparsity.

Result: LLMs produced effective and interpretable pipelines, achieving high SHAP fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely matching baselines.

Conclusion: LLMs are viable automated tools for generating interpretable ML pipelines, enabling rapid development with faithful explanations.

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions.
We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely
matching manually engineered baselines.

### [218] [Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06940)
*Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri,Or Feldman,Moshe Eliasof,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study on node affinity prediction in temporal graphs finds TGNNs underperform simple heuristics and proposes NAViS (Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State) to bridge heuristics and state-space modeling, coupled with a novel loss function; NAViS outperforms prior methods on TGB and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify why current TGNN-based approaches for node affinity prediction underperform simple heuristics and how to close the gap by leveraging state-space equivalents of heuristics.

Method: Analyze training challenges of TGNNs for node affinity, synthesize solutions, design NAViS by exploiting the equivalence between heuristics and state-space models, and introduce a novel loss function for node affinity prediction.

Result: NAViS achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including heuristics, on the TGB dataset.

Conclusion: NAViS is a promising direction for node affinity prediction, demonstrating that combining heuristics with state-space modeling and a tailored loss function can outperform existing approaches; source code is available.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

### [219] [Fisher Information, Training and Bias in Fourier Regression Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06945)
*Lorenzo Pastori,Veronika Eyring,Mierk Schwabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work connects Fisher information-based evaluation of quantum neural networks (QNNs) to their trainability by treating many QNNs as Fourier models; it shows how effective dimension and bias affect training, derives the FIM for Fourier models, and provides tunable, tensor-network representations to study QNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by growing interest in quantum machine learning, the paper seeks to understand how geometry (FIM) and the alignment of a model with the task (bias) influence trainability and performance.

Method: Derive an analytical expression for the Fisher information matrix for Fourier models; analyze the interplay between effective dimension and bias; construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias; introduce a tensor network representation of the Fourier models.

Result: For unbiased models, higher effective dimension tends to improve trainability and performance; for biased models, lower effective dimension is beneficial during training; identify the features controlling effective dimension and demonstrate tunable models and a tensor-network representation that may aid QNN analysis.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a concrete link between geometric properties, model-task alignment, and training dynamics, offering tools (analytical FIM, tunable models, tensor networks) that could benefit the broader machine-learning community studying QNNs.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

### [220] [Grouped Differential Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06949)
*Junghwan Lim,Sungmin Lee,Dongseok Kim,Wai Ting Cheung,Beomgyu Kim,Taehwan Kim,Haesol Lee,Junhyeok Lee,Dongpin Oh,Eunhwan Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grouped Differential Attention (GDA) introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving and noise-control groups, boosting signal fidelity and generalization with minimal overhead and scalable capacity growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention often wastes computation on redundant/noisy context; prior Differential Attention required balanced head allocation, limiting flexibility and scalability.

Method: Split attention heads into signal-preserving and noise-control groups with more heads dedicated to signal extraction and fewer to noise control; stabilize noise control via controlled repetition (akin to GQA); extend via group-differentiated growth by selectively replicating only signal-focused heads to enable efficient capacity expansion.

Result: Large-scale pretraining and continual training show moderate imbalance ratios in GDA significantly improve generalization and stability compared with symmetric baselines, achieving stronger signal fidelity with little computational overhead.

Conclusion: Ratio-aware head allocation and selective expansion offer a practical, scalable approach to design computation-efficient Transformers.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

### [221] [From Condensation to Rank Collapse: A Two-Stage Analysis of Transformer Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06954)
*Zheng-An Chen,Tao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage gradient-flow analysis of linearized Transformer training reveals how small-initialization escape occurs via asymmetric perturbations, followed by condensation and rank-collapse dynamics of attention components, generalizing directional convergence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers show strong empirical performance, but their training dynamics are not well understood beyond configuration-specific studies. A principled, gradient-flow analysis may explain why small initializations can improve reasoning and how attention components evolve during training.

Method: Apply the gradient-flow framework (Zhou et al., NeurIPS 2022) to linearized Transformer training. Decompose attention into two stages: stage 1 with asymmetric weight perturbations sustaining non-degenerate gradients and enabling escape from small initialization; stage 2 with key-query matrices becoming active, driving normalized matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse, resulting in a two-stage convergence that generalizes classical directional results.

Result: Identification of a two-stage training dynamic: an initial phase where perturbations keep gradients non-degenerate and drive escape from small initializations, followed by a condensation phase where matrices align to target directions, and later joint involvement of key-query matrices leading to normalized rank-collapse, situating attention dynamics within a broader convergence framework.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled account of linearized Transformer training dynamics, clarifying stage-specific roles of attention components and offering a framework that extends beyond configuration-specific observations to a generalizable understanding of how transformers learn.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

### [222] [High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06955)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High-rate Mixout is a lightweight regularization for domain generalization that swaps fine-tuned weights with pre-trained ones at high masking rates, achieving ensemble-like robustness with substantial training cost reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensembling multiple fine-tuned models improves robustness to distribution shifts but is computationally expensive. Dropout on pre-trained models under-regularizes or harms representations. A regularization method that preserves prior knowledge while enabling adaptation is needed for efficient domain generalization.

Method: Apply Mixout to fine-tuning by probabilistically swapping a subset of learned weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training. Use high masking probabilities (0.9 for ViTs, 0.8 for ResNets) to emphasize retention of pre-trained parameters. Evaluate on five domain-generalization benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, DomainNet) with ResNet and ViT backbones; compare to ensemble baselines and measure training cost reductions.

Result: High-rate Mixout achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based methods across the five benchmarks for both ResNet and ViT architectures, while significantly reducing training costs—gradient computation reduced up to 45% and gradient memory usage up to 90%.

Conclusion: High-rate Mixout effectively balances adaptation and retention of prior knowledge, enabling competitive domain generalization with substantial computational savings; particularly beneficial when using very high masking rates to penalize deviations from pre-trained weights.

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Heitor Rapela Medeiros,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMixout improves robustness and in-domain accuracy under distribution shifts by using an adaptive EMA-based anchor and explicit resampling frequency, with sparse updates that avoid inference overhead; it outperforms Model Soups and strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines across benchmarks like ImageNet, ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning vision foundation models often boosts in-domain accuracy but harms robustness to distribution shift. Mixout introduced a stochastic regularizer, but with a fixed pretrained anchor. There is a need for an adaptive, efficient regularizer that maintains robustness under distribution shifts.

Method: Introduce GMixout, which replaces the fixed Mixout anchor with an exponential moving-average (EMA) snapshot that adapts during training and adds a resampling-frequency hyperparameter to control the masking period. Implement a sparse-kernel version that updates only a small fraction of parameters, incurring no inference-time overhead.

Result: Empirical results show GMixout yields robust improvements: in-domain accuracy exceeds zero-shot baselines and outperforms Model Soups and other strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift, across diverse datasets (ImageNet/ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, CIFAR100-C, covariate shift, corruption, class imbalance).

Conclusion: GMixout offers a practical, adaptive, sparse regularizer that improves robustness to distribution shifts while preserving or enhancing in-domain accuracy, scalable to large vision models and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Motivation: To reconcile data science lifecycles with real-world business needs, improving productivity and competitiveness, and enabling continuous iteration.

Method: Introduce a spiral lifecycle model for data science in business contexts, emphasizing versatility, agility, and iterative progression over traditional linear cycles.

Result: The abstract presents a concept/technique rather than empirical results; no experiments are reported.

Conclusion: Spiral technique offers a flexible, iterative approach for applying data science workflows to business problems with defined end goals, potentially enhancing adaptability and outcomes.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data
science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their
competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important
contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are
involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or
cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible
in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

### [225] [Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07018)
*Dung Hoang-Anh,Cuong Pham Trung Le,Jianfei Cai,Thanh-Toan Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-shot quantization method that integrates sharpness into synthetic data generation via gradient-matching-based data generation, achieving better generalization in low-bit quantization on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot quantization ignores model sharpness, yet lower sharpness is associated with better generalization. In a data-free setup, there is a need to control sharpness during synthetic data generation to improve quantization performance.

Method: Proposes that sharpness minimization can be achieved by maximizing gradient matching between reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic data and those on real validation data under certain assumptions. Since real validation data isn't available, this gradient matching is approximated by matching gradients between each generated sample and its neighboring samples, enabling data-free optimization of sharpness.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques, particularly in low-bit quantization settings.

Conclusion: Incorporating sharpness-aware synthetic data generation via neighbor-based gradient matching improves generalization of zero-shot quantized models, with notable gains in low-bitwidth regimes.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

*ZiHeng Huang,Di Wu,Jun Bai,Jiale Zhang,Sicong Cao,Ji Zhang,Yingjie Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper exposes fairness and realism gaps in federated unlearning benchmarks and introduces FedCCCU, a fairness-aware unlearning method, along with a comprehensive benchmark, achieving superior performance over existing methods under realistic data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data deletion rights (e.g., right to be forgotten) in Federated Learning require effective unlearning. Current unlearning methods often ignore fairness across clients or rely on synthetic IID/non-IID benchmarks, which misrepresent real-world heterogeneity and impact.

Method: First, perform a comprehensive benchmark of existing federated unlearning methods under realistic data heterogeneity and fairness constraints. Then, propose Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), a fairness-aware FU approach that explicitly enforces cross-client constraints to balance unlearning effects across clients while maintaining performance on retained data.

Result: Existing FU methods perform poorly under realistic heterogeneity and fairness conditions, while FedCCCU consistently outperforms them across evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: FedCCCU offers a practical, scalable solution for real-world federated unlearning by addressing both fairness and realism in evaluation and method design.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

*Tengwei Song,Min Wu,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexMol enables unified molecular pre-training across 2D and 3D modalities with single-modality inference, using separate modality-specific models, parameter sharing, and a decoder for the missing modality, achieving strong results on molecular property tasks and with incomplete data; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D/3D molecular pre-training methods require paired multi-modal data, which is costly and may be unavailable, risking modality collapse and limiting applicability. A flexible framework that supports single-modality input while leveraging cross-modal knowledge is desirable.

Method: The approach uses separate models for 2D and 3D data, with parameter sharing to improve efficiency. A decoder can generate features for the missing modality. Training follows a multistage continuous learning paradigm where both modalities contribute during training, but inference remains robust when only one modality is available.

Result: Experiments show FlexMol achieves superior performance across a broad range of molecular property prediction tasks and empirically demonstrates effectiveness with incomplete data. Code and data are released.

Conclusion: FlexMol offers a robust, flexible, and efficient pre-training framework for molecular representations, reducing reliance on paired modalities and enabling strong performance with partial data while maintaining cross-modal capabilities.

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMPASS is a travel-planning benchmark for real-world LLM agents that combines hard constraints with soft user preferences in multi-turn planning. It uses a realistic travel database for 20 U.S. National Parks and a booking-platform–like tool ecosystem. The study reveals two gaps in current models: an acceptable-optimal gap (constraints met but preferences not optimized) and a plan-coordination gap (multi-service coordination failures, worsened for open-source models).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM agents must perform constrained optimization and strategic tool use in multi-turn interactions to assist complex planning tasks. Existing benchmarks often lack realistic hard constraints, end-to-end tool use, and multi-service coordination, limiting evaluation of practical capabilities and real-world impact.

Method: Construct COMPASS: frame travel planning as constrained preference optimization with hard constraints and soft preferences. Build a realistic travel database (transportation, accommodation, tickets) for 20 National Parks and a diverse tool ecosystem resembling booking platforms. Evaluate state-of-the-art models on multi-turn travel tasks, assess constraint satisfaction, preference optimization, and plan-coordination across services (e.g., flights and hotels).

Result: Identification of two critical gaps: (i) acceptable-optimal gap, where constraints are reliably satisfied but user preferences are not optimally satisfied, and (ii) plan-coordination gap, where multi-service coordination fails, particularly for open-source models. These findings highlight deficiencies in current models’ ability to ground reasoning in a practical domain and to coordinate complex, multi-service plans.

Conclusion: COMPASS provides a practical benchmark that directly measures an agent’s ability to optimize user preferences under realistic constraints, bridging theoretical advancement with real-world impact and guiding the development of more capable, user-aligned LLM agents.

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

*Aryan Golbaghi,Shuo Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient CPU-based SER with pre-trained wav2vec2 encoder using GP-BO and TPE achieves high balanced class accuracy on EmoDB with substantial time savings, outperforming grid search and competitive AutoSpeech baselines, and provides cross-lingual gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost of hyperparameter optimization in speech emotion recognition while leveraging strong pre-trained representations, enabling practical deployment on commodity hardware and improving cross-lingual generalisation.

Method: Encoder: SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) strategies: Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization (GP-BO) and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE). Search space: four dimensions, 15 trials; objective: balanced class accuracy (BCA) on EmoDB. Hardware: 8 CPU cores, 32 GB RAM. Baselines for comparison: grid search (143 trials, 1,680 minutes) and AutoSpeech 2020 baseline (0.85 BCA on GPU). Cross-lingual evaluation: EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model zero-shot accuracy on CREMA-D and RAVDESS. Code available at: https://github.com/youngaryan/speechbrain-emotion-hpo

Result: GP-BO achieved 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes; TPE achieved 0.97 BCA in 15 minutes. Grid search required 143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA; AutoSpeech 2020 baseline reported 0.85 BCA in 30 minutes on GPU. Cross-lingual: EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improved zero-shot accuracy by 0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS.

Conclusion: Efficient hyperparameter optimization with pre-trained encoders yields competitive speech emotion recognition performance on commodity CPUs, with GP-BO and TPE delivering substantial speedups over grid search and yielding tangible cross-lingual generalisation benefits; source code is available for replication.

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

### [230] [Blind Construction of Angular Power Maps in Massive MIMO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07071)
*Zheng Xing,Junting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised angular power map construction for massive MIMO using HMM to link mobile trajectory with CSI evolution, enabling localization and map construction without location labels; CRLB analysis shows localization can vanish under certain conditions; practical 18 m localization error observed with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSI acquisition in massive MIMO is challenging and radio maps can aid resource management, but collecting location-labeled data is hard. An unsupervised approach that uses large-timescale CSI data and no location labels can enable radio map construction by inferring mobile trajectories and positions.

Method: Build a hidden Markov model that ties hidden mobile trajectory to the evolution of the massive MIMO channel’s CSI. Estimate the mobile location from CSI, then construct an angular power map. Analyze CRLB for localization under two scenarios: (i) uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed BSs, where CRLB can vanish at any SNR; (ii) BSs confined to a limited region, where the error remains nonzero even with infinite measurements. Validate on real RSRP data from a multi-cell network.

Result: Under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson BSs, localization CRLB can vanish at all SNRs. If BSs are limited to a region, localization error remains nonzero even with unlimited measurements. Real-data results show an average localization error of about 18 meters using RSRP data, with measurements mainly from a single serving cell.

Conclusion: Unsupervised angular power map construction for massive MIMO is feasible by inferring mobile trajectories from CSI via HMM, enabling radio map construction without location labels. Localization performance hinges on BS deployment; there is potential for zero-CRLB localization in favorable deployment, while practical deployments yield finite error. Real data demonstrates practical viability though relying heavily on a single serving cell.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

### [231] [HTMformer: Hybrid Time and Multivariate Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07084)
*Tan Wang,Yun Wei Dong,Tao Zhang,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces HTME-based embeddings and HTMformer to improve time-series forecasting by enriching representations with temporal and multivariate features, achieving better accuracy and efficiency on eight real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers for time series can overemphasize temporal dependencies and incur computational overhead; embedding choices strongly affect performance; need richer, multidimensional embeddings to capture informative structures.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate Embeddings (HTME) combining a lightweight temporal feature extractor with a multivariate feature extractor to produce multidimensional embeddings; integrates HTME with Transformer to form HTMformer, a lightweight forecaster.

Result: Empirical results on eight real-world datasets show HTMformer surpasses baselines in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: HTME embeddings with Transformer improve forecasting performance while maintaining low complexity; HTMformer validates the utility of multidimensional representations for sequential modeling.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

### [232] [Non-Stationary Online Structured Prediction with Surrogate Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07086)
*Shinsaku Sakaue,Han Bao,Yuzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Develops a non-stationary online structured prediction bound: the cumulative target loss is upper-bounded by F_T + C(1+P_T), where F_T is the comparator's cumulative surrogate loss and P_T its path length; combines online gradient descent dynamics with surrogate-gap techniques, extends to Fenchel–Young losses, and proves a tight lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surrogate-regret bounds can be vacuous in non-stationary environments where fixed predictors incur linear surrogate loss. The work seeks target-loss guarantees under changing data by tying regret to both surrogate loss and the path length of the comparator.

Method: Derives a dynamic-regret bound for online gradient descent (OGD) augmented by a surrogate-gap exploitation technique. Introduces a Polyak-style learning rate for OGD that yields target-loss guarantees. Extends the framework to a broader class via the convolutional Fenchel–Young loss and proves a matching lower bound for tightness.

Result: A bound of the form F_T + C(1+P_T) on cumulative target loss is established, depending on F_T and P_T rather than T. The approach provides stronger guarantees in non-stationary settings, shows the bound is tight, and yields encouraging empirical performance for the proposed learning rate and loss family.

Conclusion: The paper delivers robust target-loss guarantees in non-stationary online structured prediction by unifying dynamic regret with surrogate-gap analysis, clarifying the role of comparator complexity through F_T and P_T, and offering a generalizable framework with tightness results.

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

### [233] [Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Efficiency in Conformalized Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07093)
*Yunzhen Yao,Lie He,Michael Gastpar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Non-asymptotic bounds on the excess length of conformalized regression prediction sets trained with SGD, showing how training size n, calibration size m, and miscoverage level alpha jointly affect efficiency, with phase transitions across alpha and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve understanding of the efficiency (prediction-set length) of conformal prediction in regression. Unlike prior work that fixes alpha, this work provides bounds that quantify the impact of data allocation and miscoverage level on excess length, guiding practical choices.

Method: Derive non-asymptotic bounds for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD under mild distribution assumptions. Obtain a bound of order O(1/√n + 1/(α^2 n) + 1/√m + exp(−α^2 m)), and analyze how the joint dependence on n, m, and α yields phase transitions in convergence rates, complemented by empirical validation.

Result: Theoretical bounds showing joint dependence on training and calibration data sizes and alpha, with phase-transition behavior across alpha regimes; data allocation strategies are informed by these bounds; empirical results corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: Provides finite-sample guarantees on the efficiency of conformalized regression and practical guidance for allocating data between training and calibration sets and choosing alpha to control excess prediction-set length, supported by experiments.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

### [234] [DPMM-CFL: Clustered Federated Learning via Dirichlet Process Mixture Model Nonparametric Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07132)
*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPMM-CFL introduces a Dirichlet Process prior into clustered federated learning to infer both the number of clusters and client assignments online, coupling clustering with federated optimization; validated on standard non-IID partitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixing the number of clusters K is impractical when the latent structure is unknown; adaptive, data-driven clustering is needed to balance global and personalized models under heterogeneity.

Method: Place a Dirichlet Process prior over cluster parameters and perform nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly infer the number of clusters and client-to-cluster assignments, while optimizing per-cluster federated objectives. At each round, federated updates and cluster inferences are tightly coupled.

Result: Validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet and class-split non-IID partitions, demonstrating effectiveness and adaptability to varying latent cluster structures.

Conclusion: A nonparametric DP-based CFL framework that automatically discovers cluster structure and integrates it with federated optimization, reducing the need to preset K and performing well across non-IID scenarios.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

### [235] [A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07147)
*Arshika Lalan,Rajat Ghosh,Aditya Kolsur,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free, stateful multi-agent evolutionary search framework improves edge-case unit-test generation by maintaining persistent inference-time state, introducing adversarial mutation, and using evolutionary preservation to achieve higher code coverage across unseen codebases, outperforming stateless baselines on HumanEval, TestGenEvalMini, using Llama, Gemma, and GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stateless inference struggles with multi-step reasoning and long-horizon tasks; fine-tuning/instruction-tuning yields brittle results for deep reasoning and long dependencies. A training-free, stateful approach aims to enable persistent reasoning and exploration during inference.

Method: Propose a stateful multi-agent evolutionary search: a persistent controller maintains state across generations; specialized agents propose, mutate, and score edge-case candidates; adversarial mutation drives difficult cases; evolutionary preservation maintains diversity and exploration across all cases.

Result: The framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless single-step baselines on unit-testing benchmarks (HumanEval, TestGenEvalMini) across three LLM families (Llama, Gemma, GPT).

Conclusion: Persisting inference-time state together with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation, enabling a generalist agent to discover robust, high-coverage edge cases across unseen codebases without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

### [236] [Bridged Clustering for Representation Learning: Semi-Supervised Sparse Bridging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07182)
*Patrick Peixuan Ye,Chen Shani,Ellen Vitercik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bridged Clustering learns from unpaired X and Y by clustering both domains, building a sparse, interpretable bridge from a few paired examples, and predicting by the nearest input cluster's linked output centroid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage abundant output-only and unpaired data to create an interpretable, efficient semi-supervised predictor that avoids dense transport and maintains sparsity.

Method: Cluster X and Y independently; learn a sparse bridge between clusters using limited paired data; at inference assign x to its input cluster and return the centroid of the linked output cluster; provide theoretical bounds on mis-clustering/mis-bridging; model-agnostic and interpretable.

Result: Empirically competitive with state-of-the-art methods while being simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision regimes.

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering offers a scalable, interpretable semi-supervised framework that effectively exploits unpaired data and limited paired data, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

### [237] [Poisoning Attacks on LLMs Require a Near-constant Number of Poison Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07192)
*Alexandra Souly,Javier Rando,Ed Chapman,Xander Davies,Burak Hasircioglu,Ezzeldin Shereen,Carlos Mougan,Vasilios Mavroudis,Erik Jones,Chris Hicks,Nicholas Carlini,Yarin Gal,Robert Kirk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tiny, dataset-size-invariant set of poisoned documents (≈250) can backdoor LLMs during pretraining and fine-tuning, regardless of model size or data scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging assumed defense: prior work framed poisoning as a function of data percentage, which is impractical for huge corpora. The study argues the threat model must be re-evaluated for large models.

Method: Authors conduct the largest pretraining poisoning experiments to date, training models from 600M to 13B parameters on chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B–260B tokens). They inject 250 poisoned documents and perform ablations on poisoned:clean ratios and distributions; also replicate poisoning dynamics during fine-tuning.

Result: Poisoning with 250 documents compromises models across sizes and data scales; larger datasets do not dilute the attack. The same dynamics hold for poisoning during fine-tuning, indicating a near-constant number of poisons suffices regardless of model/data size.

Conclusion: Backdoors via data poisoning may be easier for large models than previously believed; defenses are needed. Threat models should consider a fixed number of poisoned documents, not a data percentage; more research is required to mitigate this risk in future models.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

### [238] [An in-depth look at approximation via deep and narrow neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07202)
*Joris Dommel,Sven A. Wegner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper analyzes approximating a critical counterexample function by ReLU networks at width threshold w=n and w=n+1, focusing on how depth and dying neurons affect approximation quality near the threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical behavior of the universal approximation threshold w>n by directly approximating the known counterexample function at the threshold, and to study how depth and neuron saturation (dying neurons) influence the quality of approximation.

Method: Construct neural networks with widths n and n+1, approximate the counterexample function f: R^n -> R, vary network depth, and analyze approximation error and the occurrence/impact of dying neurons.

Result: The paper shows that approximation quality at the threshold depends on depth and is influenced by dying neurons, with observable distinctions between widths w=n and w=n+1 in how well the function can be approximated.

Conclusion: Near the threshold, depth and neuron-saturation phenomena govern practical approximation capabilities; the results illuminate the boundary between universality (w>n) and practical limitations at w=n and w=n+1.

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

### [239] [Guided by the Experts: Provable Feature Learning Dynamic of Soft-Routed Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07205)
*Fangshuo Liao,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proves convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with non-linear routers and experts in a student–teacher setting under moderate over-parameterization. It shows a feature-learning phase where the router is guided by experts to recover the teacher’s parameters, and demonstrates that after pruning redundant neurons, a subsequent fine-tuning stage converges to a global optimum. This is a first theoretical advance on MoE optimization landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics is limited, especially for joint optimization of soft routing and non-linear experts. Existing results focus on separate optimization or top-1 routing with contrived data. A rigorous analysis of joint training and router-expert interactions is needed to explain empirical success and guide practice.

Method: The authors analyze a student–teacher MoE framework with soft routing and non-linear routers/experts under moderate over-parameterization. They identify a feature-learning phase in which router updates align with the teacher via the expert pathways. They show a pruning step can remove redundancy, followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning phase that attains global optimality.

Result: Under moderate over-parameterization, the student learns features aligned with the teacher and can recover the teacher's parameters. Post-training pruning eliminates redundant neurons, and after fine-tuning, the model converges to a globally optimal solution. These results provide the first rigorous insights into the MoE optimization landscape under joint soft routing.

Conclusion: The work delivers foundational convergence guarantees for joint soft MoE training with non-linear routers in a student–teacher setting, along with a practical pruning-plus-fine-tuning pipeline that achieves global optimality. It marks a novel theoretical milestone in understanding MoE training dynamics.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

### [240] [A Broader View of Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07208)
*Yanlin Qu,Hongseok Namkoong,Assaf Zeevi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson Sampling can be interpreted as an online optimization method via a faithful stationarization of regret, yielding a time-invariant Bellman-optimal policy that balances exploration and exploitation through a residual uncertainty term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demystify the mechanism of posterior sampling in Thompson Sampling and provide a principled framework for analysis and improvement by linking it to online optimization and Bellman principles.

Method: Convert finite-horizon regret into a stationary problem via a 'faithful' stationarization; apply Bellman's principle to derive a time-invariant optimal policy; show that Thompson Sampling corresponds to a simple online optimization with greediness tempered by residual uncertainty (via point-biserial correlation).

Result: A time-invariant online optimization formulation of Thompson Sampling is obtained; the exploration-exploitation balance emerges from a residual uncertainty term, aligning TS with Bellman-optimal policy.

Conclusion: The paper clarifies how Thompson Sampling works, offers a principled framework to analyze/improve it, and connects posterior sampling to canonical online optimization methods.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

### [241] [Discriminative Feature Feedback with General Teacher Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07245)
*Omri Bar Oz,Tosca Lechner,Sivan Sabato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical analysis of Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) with a new realizable-dimension notion, establishing mistake bounds for realizable and non-realizable settings, and highlighting fundamental differences from Online Learning (no-regret guarantees depend on richer feedback beyond realizable dimension).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how richer feedback via discriminative feature explanations affects learning theory, compare DFF with classical protocols (supervised/online learning), and determine fundamental limits such as optimal mistake bounds and the existence of no-regret algorithms.

Method: Develop a general framework for DFF that is comparable to supervised and online learning; derive optimal mistake bounds in realizable and non-realizable settings; introduce a new notion of realizable dimension; prove bounds and separations; analyze tightness and limitations of the dimension-based characterizations.

Result: In the realizable setting, the mistake bound is characterized by a new realizable dimension. In the non-realizable setting, an upper bound on the mistake count is provided and shown to be generally tight (cannot be improved). Crucially, the realizable dimension does not suffice to characterize the optimal non-realizable bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms in DFF, unlike in Online Learning.

Conclusion: Richer feedback in DFF fundamentally changes the theoretical landscape compared to Online Learning; realizable-dimension-based characterizations are insufficient for non-realizable performance and for predicting/no-regret guarantees, indicating the need for new tools and concepts to analyze interactive learning with discriminative feature feedback.

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

### [242] [Test-Time Graph Search for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07257)
*Evgenii Opryshko,Junwei Quan,Claas Voelcker,Yilun Du,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TTGS is a lightweight test-time planning method for offline GCRL that builds a graph over dataset states to assemble goal sequences for a frozen policy, using value-function distances if available; requires no training changes, supervision, or online interaction; improves success on OGBench locomotion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline goal-conditioned RL struggles with long-horizon credit assignment and error accumulation, and the offline setting amplifies these issues. A simple, inference-time planning approach that leverages existing data and models could improve performance without additional data or supervision.

Method: TTGS constructs a weighted graph over dataset states using any state-space distance or cost signal. It performs fast search at test time to assemble a sequence of subgoals that a pre-trained, frozen policy can reach. If the base learner is value-based, the distance is derived from the learned goal-conditioned value function, removing the need for handcrafted metrics. No changes to training, supervision, online interaction, or privileged information are required; all planning happens at inference.

Result: On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS improves success rates for multiple base learners on challenging locomotion tasks.

Conclusion: Simple metric-guided test-time planning can mitigate long-horizon decision-making challenges in offline GCRL without altering training, offering a lightweight, plug-in improvement at inference time.

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

### [243] [Dynamic Regret Bounds for Online Omniprediction with Long Term Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07266)
*Yahav Bechavod,Jiuyao Lu,Aaron Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First online omniprediction algorithm with long-term constraints that achieves simultaneous dynamic regret bounds for all downstream agents while driving constraint violations to zero, without requiring agents to maintain state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address coordinating multiple downstream decision-makers, each with their own utility and long-term constraints, in an online setting with adversarial states. The goal is robust predictions that ensure worst-case utilities for all agents while keeping constraint violations vanishing.

Method: Proposes a novel online algorithm that, each round, solves a one-round constrained optimization problem defined by the current prediction. The algorithm provides simultaneous dynamic regret guarantees for all agents and ensures vanishing constraint violations; agents themselves do not need to maintain state.

Result: The first algorithm to achieve simultaneous dynamic regret guarantees for all agents under long-term constraints with vanishing constraint violations in the online omniprediction setting.

Conclusion: This framework enables predictions that ensure worst-case utility guarantees across all downstream agents while controlling constraint violations, without requiring agent state, broadening the applicability of omniprediction in adversarial environments.

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

### [244] [GTCN-G: A Residual Graph-Temporal Fusion Network for Imbalanced Intrusion Detection (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07285)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Qi Hu,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTCN-G integrates gated temporal convolutional networks with graph convolutional networks and residual graph-attention to tackle data imbalance in IDS, achieving state-of-the-art results on UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT for binary and multi-class tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network threats are increasingly complex and data is imbalanced; existing GNNs and TCNs address different aspects separately, but a unified framework that jointly models temporal dynamics, graph structure, and minority-class detection remains lacking.

Method: Introduce GTCN-G, which combines a G-TCN for hierarchical temporal feature extraction with a GCN to learn from graph structure; employs residual learning via a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to preserve original features and improve minority-class detection; evaluated on UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT datasets with binary and multi-class classification.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline models on both datasets for both binary and multi-class tasks.

Conclusion: The fusion of temporal and graph modeling with residual attention effectively mitigates class imbalance and enhances IDS performance against complex network threats.

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

### [245] [Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286)
*Jigang Fan,Xiaoran Jiao,Shengdong Lin,Zhanming Liang,Weian Mao,Chenchen Jing,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoIF combines sequence-structure representations with two evolutionary signals (within-family retrievals and cross-family inverse-folding constraints) to calibrate log-odds fitness estimates, delivering state-of-the-art or competitive performance on ProteinGym with minimal data and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting mutation fitness is severely data-limited; protein language models excel in zero-shot predictions but can be enhanced by explicit evolutionary signals. Interpreting MLMs as inverse reinforcement learning aligns natural evolution with fitness estimation.

Method: Introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that fuses sequence-structure representations with two evolutionary signals: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs, and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits, via a compact transition block to produce calibrated log-odds fitness probabilities.

Result: On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance using only 0.15% of training data and fewer parameters than recent large models; ablations show both signals are complementary and robust across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

Conclusion: EvoIF provides an efficient, robust approach to fitness prediction by leveraging complementary evolutionary signals within a compact model, with public code to follow.

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

### [246] [MolGA: Molecular Graph Adaptation with Pre-trained 2D Graph Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07289)
*Xingtong Yu,Chang Zhou,Xinming Zhang,Yuan Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolGA enables flexible integration of molecular domain knowledge into pre-trained 2D graph encoders via molecular alignment and conditional adaptation, showing strong results across 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained 2D graph encoders miss submolecular knowledge (atoms, bonds) and existing pre-training is often tied to specific knowledge types. Reusing pre-trained encoders with downstream adaptation to incorporate diverse molecular knowledge is practical and desirable.

Method: MolGA introduces (1) a molecular alignment strategy that bridges pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations, and (2) a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain knowledge for downstream tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on eleven public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MolGA in incorporating molecular domain knowledge into pre-trained 2D graph encoders for downstream molecular tasks.

Conclusion: MolGA provides a flexible and practical framework to adapt pre-trained 2D graph encoders by integrating diverse molecular knowledge at inference time, improving downstream performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

*Rushi Qiang,Yuchen Zhuang,Anikait Singh,Percy Liang,Chao Zhang,Sherry Yang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLE-Smith is a fully automated multi-agent pipeline that converts raw datasets into scalable, high-quality competition-style MLE tasks using a generate-verify-execute loop, validated across 224 datasets to produce 606 tasks, showing strong alignment with human-designed benchmarks and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLE benchmarks are limited in scalability and rely on manual curation, hindering rapid data generation for training and evaluating LMs. There is a need for automated, diverse, verifiable, real-world MLE tasks.

Method: A multi-agent generate-verify-execute pipeline that (1) designs tasks with structured prompts and standardized refactoring, (2) employs a hybrid verifier enforcing structural rules and semantic soundness, and (3) uses interactive execution to validate empirical solvability and real-world fidelity. Applied to 224 real-world datasets to generate 606 tasks across multiple categories, objectives, and modalities.

Result: Evaluation across eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs shows task performance correlates strongly with performance on carefully human-designed tasks, indicating that MLE-Smith tasks are faithful proxies and that the pipeline scales MLE task generation while preserving quality.

Conclusion: MLE-Smith demonstrates scalable, high-quality MLE task generation across real-world datasets via automated pipelines, enabling broader coverage and usable benchmarks while maintaining alignment with human-designed standards.

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

*Sumeet Ramesh Motwani,Alesia Ivanova,Ziyang Cai,Philip Torr,Riashat Islam,Shital Shah,Christian Schroeder de Witt,Charles London*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable RL approach that builds long-horizon reasoning from abundant short-horizon data by synthetically composing problems and using outcome-only rewards in a curriculum, yielding substantial gains on long-horizon math benchmarks and a theoretical exponential sample-efficiency advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon reasoning in LLMs lags behind short-horizon performance; existing inference-time scaffolding or dense supervision methods scale poorly or are costly. There is a need for data-efficient, scalable training signals that can extend reasoning horizons without extra supervision.

Method: Create synthetic multi-step dependency chains by composing simple, short-horizon problems from existing data. Train models with reinforcement learning using outcome-only rewards across a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, enabling scalable long-horizon training without dense step-level supervision.

Result: Empirically, shows up to 2.06x accuracy gains on long-horizon benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) when trained on 6th-grade GSM8K-style problems. Improvements persist at high pass@k, indicating new reasoning paths are learned under RL. Theoretically, curriculum RL with outcome rewards yields exponential improvement in sample complexity versus full-horizon training.

Conclusion: Proposes an efficient path to scale RL for long-horizon reasoning using only existing data, reducing reliance on costly supervision while delivering strong generalization to longer benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.
