Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and\ndata during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow\ntrajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based\nmethods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data\npoints, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets\nin FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages\nSemi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by\nestablishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data\npoints with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by\npartitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a\ncorresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired\nwith data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and\nmodel architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental\nresults show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play\ncomponent.

However, existing methods\noften predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the\nscene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric\ninconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose\nSaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.\nTo our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method\ncapable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%\nredundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to\neliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian\nquantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor\nattributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric\ninconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone\nto predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional\ngeometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors\nby prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns\nspatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor\nattributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for\ngeometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,\nour approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a\nsingle feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our\nstate-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,\ndemonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for\nlong-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

Yet,\nvision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture\nthe complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their\nability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper\npresents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition\nframework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach\ncombines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical\nflow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV\nmotion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract\ndiscriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is\nadopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To\nenhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module\nis introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature\nscales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic\nconsistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations.

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches\nwith potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of\nspatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary\nVLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)\nto impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)\nformulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to\nexplore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically\nextracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them\nas first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel\nlearns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., \"cat\") and a spatial pseudo\ncategory (e.g., \"right of person\") simultaneously, enforcing relational\nconstraints (e.g., a \"cat\" pixel must lie to the right of a \"person\"). Finally,\nthese logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy\nlogic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally\nconsistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows\nclear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of\nonly introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,\nvalidating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.", "AI": {"tldr": "RelateSeg introduces neuro-symbolic spatial reasoning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by encoding spatial relations as first-order logic with fuzzy relaxation, achieving state-of-the-art average mIoU with minimal extra cost.", "motivation": "OVSS must generalize to unseen/unlabelled objects and leverage spatial relations; current VLM-based correlations lack explicit spatial reasoning, hindering segmentation in cluttered scenes.", "method": "RelateSeg extracts spatial relations like <cat, to-right-of, person>, encodes them as first-order logic formulas via pseudo categories, and trains a network where each pixel predicts both semantic and spatial pseudo categories; fuzzy logic relaxation enforces relational constraints end-to-end.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art average mIoU across four benchmarks, with clear benefits on images containing multiple categories; uses only a single auxiliary loss and no extra parameters.", "conclusion": "First attempt at NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS; shows relational constraints improve open-vocabulary segmentation and validates the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning for spatial awareness."}}
